\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Appointment, on the first day of the second new moon, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Mitsrayim, saying,
\v 2 "Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, every male, one by one;
\v 3 from twenty years old and upward, all who are able to go out to war in Yisra'el. You and Aharon shall number them by their divisions.
\v 4 With you there shall be a man of every tribe; everyone head of his fathers' house.
\p
\v 5 These are the names of the men who shall stand with you: Of Reuven: Elitsur the son of Shedeur.

\v 16 These are those who were called of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads of the thousands of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 17 Mosheh and Aharon took these men who are mentioned by name.
\v 18 They assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second new moon; and they declared their ancestry by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, one by one.
\v 19 As יהוה commanded Mosheh, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
\p
\v 20 The children of Reuven, Yisra'el's firstborn, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, one by one, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;
\v 21 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Reuven, were forty-six thousand five hundred.
\p
\v 22 Of the children of Shimon, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;

\p
\v 24 Of the children of Gad, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;
\v 25 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Gad, were forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.

\v 29 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Yissakhar, were fifty-four thousand four hundred.
\p
\v 30 Of the children of Zevulun, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;
\v 31 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Zevulun, were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
\p
\v 32 Of the children of Yoseph, of the children of Ephrayim, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;
\v 33 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Ephrayim, were forty thousand five hundred.
\p
\v 34 Of the children of Menasheh, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;

\v 39 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Dan, were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
\p
\v 40 Of the children of Asher, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth to war;

\v 43 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
\p
\v 44 These are those who were numbered, whom Mosheh and Aharon numbered, and the princes of Yisra'el, being twelve men: they were each one for his fathers' house.
\v 45 So all those who were numbered of the children of Yisra'el by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war in Yisra'el;
\v 46 even all those who were numbered were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.
\p
\v 47 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
\v 48 For יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 49 "Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, neither shall you take a census of them among the children of Yisra'el;
\v 50 but appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the witness, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the Tabernacle, and all its furnishings; and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it.
\v 51 When the Tabernacle is to move, the Levites shall take it down; and when the Tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
\v 52 The children of Yisra'el shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their divisions.
\v 53 But the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the witness, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Yisra'el: and the Levites shall guard the charge for the Tabernacle of the witness."
\v 54 Thus the children of Yisra'el did. According to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh, so they did.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
\v 2 "The children of Yisra'el shall encamp every man by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers' houses: at a distance from the Tent of Appointment shall they encamp around it."
\v 3 Those who encamp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Yehudah, according to their divisions: and the prince of the children of Yehudah shall be Naḥshon the son of Amminadav.
\v 4 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were seventy-four thousand six hundred.
\v 5 Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Yissakhar: and the prince of the children of Yissakhar shall be Nethan'el the son of Tsuar.
\v 6 His army, and those who were numbered of it, were fifty-four thousand four hundred.
\v 7 The tribe of Zevulun: and the prince of the children of Zevulun shall be Eliav the son of Ḥelon.
\v 8 His army, and those who were numbered of it, were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
\v 9 All who were numbered of the camp of Yehudah were one hundred eighty-six thousand four hundred, according to their armies. They shall set out first.
\p
\v 10 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuven according to their divisions. The prince of the children of Reuven shall be Elitsur the son of Shedeur.
\v 11 His army, and those who were numbered of it, were forty-six thousand five hundred.
\v 12 Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Shimon. The prince of the children of Shimon shall be Shelumi'el the son of Tsurishaddai.
\v 13 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
\v 14 The tribe of Gad: and the prince of the children of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reu'el.
\v 15 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.
\v 16 All who were numbered of the camp of Reuven were one hundred fifty-one thousand four hundred fifty, according to their armies. They shall set out second.
\p
\v 17 Then the Tent of Appointment shall set out, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps. As they encamp, so shall they set out, every man in his place, by their standards.
\p
\v 18 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephrayim according to their divisions: and the prince of the children of Ephrayim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.
\v 19 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were forty thousand five hundred.
\v 20 Next to him shall be the tribe of Menasheh: and the prince of the children of Menasheh shall be Gamali'el the son of Pedahtsur.
\v 21 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were thirty-two thousand two hundred.
\v 22 The tribe of Benyamin: and the prince of the children of Benyamin shall be Avidan the son of Gidoni.
\v 23 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.
\v 24 All who were numbered of the camp of Ephrayim were one hundred eight thousand one hundred, according to their armies. They shall set out third.
\p
\v 25 On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their divisions: and the prince of the children of Dan shall be Aḥiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
\v 26 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
\v 27 Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher: and the prince of the children of Asher shall be Pagi'el the son of Oḥran.
\v 28 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were forty-one thousand and five hundred.
\v 29 The tribe of Naphtali: and the prince of the children of Naphtali shall be Aḥira the son of Enan.
\v 30 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
\v 31 All who were numbered of the camp of Dan were one hundred fifty-seven thousand six hundred. They shall set out last by their standards."
\p
\v 32 These are those who were numbered of the children of Yisra'el by their fathers' houses. All who were numbered of the camps according to their armies were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.
\v 33 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Yisra'el; as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\v 34 Thus the children of Yisra'el did. According to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set out, everyone by their families, according to their fathers' houses.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now this is the history of the generations of Aharon and Mosheh in the day that יהוה spoke with Mosheh in Mount Sinai.
\v 2 These are the names of the sons of Aharon: Nadav, the one who opened the womb,\f + \fr 3:2 \ft See footnote at Shemoth 13:2.\f* and Avihu, Elazar, and Ithamar.
\v 3 These are the names of the sons of Aharon, the priests who were anointed, whom he set apart to minister in the priest's office.
\v 4 Nadav and Avihu died before יהוה, when they offered strange fire before יהוה, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. Elazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the presence of Aharon their father.
\p
\v 5 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 6 "Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aharon the priest, that they may minister to him.
\v 7 They shall guard his requirements, and the requirements of the whole congregation before the Tent of Appointment, to do the service of the Tabernacle.
\v 8 They shall guard all the furnishings of the Tent of Appointment, and the obligations of the children of Yisra'el, to do the service of the Tabernacle.
\v 9 You shall give the Levites to Aharon and to his sons. They are wholly given to him\f + \fr 3:9 \ft LXX reads, "to Me" here, indicating the Levites given to Elohim, not Aharon.\f* on the behalf of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 10 You shall appoint Aharon and his sons, and they shall guard their priesthood. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death."
\p
\v 11 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 12 "Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Yisra'el instead of all the firstborn who open the womb among the children of Yisra'el; and the Levites shall be Mine:
\v 13 for all the firstborn are Mine. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Mitsrayim I made set-apart to Me all the firstborn in Yisra'el, both man and animal. They shall be Mine. I am יהוה."
\p
\v 14 יהוה spoke to Mosheh in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
\v 15 "Number the children of Levi by their fathers' houses, by their families. You shall number every male from a new moon old and upward."
\v 16 Mosheh numbered them according to the word of יהוה, as he was commanded.
\v 17 These were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Qohath, and Merari.
\v 18 These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Livni and Shimei.
\v 19 The sons of Qohath by their families: Amram, and Yitshar, Ḥevron, and Uzzi'el.
\v 20 The sons of Merari by their families: Maḥli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers' houses.
\p
\v 21 Of Gershon was the family of the Livnites, and the family of the Shimeites: these are the families of the Gershonites.
\v 22 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a new moon old and upward, even those who were numbered of them were seven thousand five hundred.
\v 23 The families of the Gershonites shall encamp behind the Tabernacle westward.
\v 24 The prince of the fathers' house of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.
\p
\v 25 The duty of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Appointment shall be the Tabernacle, and the tent, its covering, and the screen for the door of the Tent of Appointment,
\v 26 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the court, which is by the Tabernacle, and around the altar, and its cords for all of its service.
\p
\v 27 Of Qohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Yitsharites, and the family of the Ḥevronites, and the family of the Uzzi'elites: these are the families of the Qohathites.
\v 28 According to the number of all the males, from a new moon old and upward, there were eight thousand six hundred, guarding the requirements of the set-apart place.
\v 29 The families of the sons of Qohath shall encamp on the south side of the Tabernacle.
\v 30 The prince of the fathers' house of the families of the Qohathites shall be Elitsaphan the son of Uzzi'el.
\v 31 Their duty shall be the ark, the table, the lamp stand, the altars, the vessels of the set-apart place with which they minister, and the screen, and all its service.
\v 32 Elazar the son of Aharon the priest shall be prince of the princes of the Levites, with the oversight of those who guard the requirements of the set-apart place.
\p
\v 33 Of Merari was the family of the Maḥlites, and the family of the Mushites. These are the families of Merari.
\v 34 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a new moon old and upward, were six thousand two hundred.
\v 35 The prince of the fathers' house of the families of Merari was TsUri'el the son of Aviḥayil. They shall encamp on the north side of the Tabernacle.
\v 36 The appointed duty of the sons of Merari shall be the Tabernacle's boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, all its instruments, all its service,
\v 37 the pillars of the court around it, their sockets, their pins, and their cords.
\p
\v 38 Those who encamp before the Tabernacle eastward, in front of the Tent of Appointment toward the sunrise, shall be Mosheh, and Aharon and his sons, guarding the requirements of the set-apart place for the duty of the children of Yisra'el. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
\v 39 All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Mosheh and Aharon numbered at the command of יהוה, by their families, all the males from a new moon old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.
\p
\v 40 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Number all the firstborn males of the children of Yisra'el from a new moon old and upward, and take the number of their names.
\v 41 You shall take the Levites for Me (I am יהוה) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Yisra'el; and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the livestock of the children of Yisra'el."
\v 42 Mosheh numbered, as יהוה commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Yisra'el.
\v 43 All the firstborn males according to the number of names, from a new moon old and upward, of those who were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.
\p
\v 44 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 45 "Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Yisra'el, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall be Mine. I am יהוה.
\v 46 For the redemption of the two hundred seventy-three of the firstborn of the children of Yisra'el, who exceed the number of the Levites,
\v 47 you shall take five sheqels apiece for each one; after the sheqel of the set-apart place you shall take them (the sheqel is twenty gerahs):
\v 48 and you shall give the money, with which the remainder of them is redeemed, to Aharon and to his sons."
\v 49 Mosheh took the redemption money from those who exceeded the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites;
\v 50 from the firstborn of the children of Yisra'el he took the money, one thousand three hundred sixty-five sheqels, after the sheqel of the set-apart place:
\v 51 and Mosheh gave the redemption money to Aharon and to his sons, according to the word of יהוה, as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
\v 2 "Take a census of the sons of Qohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers' houses,
\v 3 from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all who enter into the host, to do the service in the Tent of Appointment.
\v 4 This is the service of the sons of Qohath in the Tent of Appointment, the most set-apart things.
\p
\v 5 When the camp moves forward, Aharon shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the witness with it,
\v 6 and shall put a covering of taḥash skin on it, and shall spread over it a cloth all of blue, and shall put in its poles.
\v 7 On the table of show bread they shall spread a blue cloth, and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the bowls, and the cups with which to pour out; and the continual bread shall be on it.
\v 8 They shall spread on them a scarlet cloth, and cover the same with a covering of taḥash skin, and shall put in its poles.
\v 9 They shall take a blue cloth, and cover the menorah of the light, and its lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff dishes, and all its oil vessels, with which they minister to it.
\v 10 They shall put it and all its vessels within a covering of taḥash skin, and shall put it on the frame.
\v 11 On the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover it with a covering of taḥash skin, and shall put in its poles.
\v 12 They shall take all the vessels of ministry, with which they minister in the set-apart place, and put them in a blue cloth, and cover them with a covering of taḥash skin, and shall put them on the frame.
\v 13 They shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth on it.
\v 14 They shall put on it all its vessels, with which they minister about it, the fire pans, the flesh hooks, the shovels, and the basins; all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread on it a covering of taḥash skin, and put in its poles.
\p
\v 15 When Aharon and his sons have finished covering the set-apart place, and all the furniture of the set-apart place, as the camp moves forward; after that, the sons of Qohath shall come to carry it: but they shall not touch the set-apart place, lest they die. These \add things\add* are the burden of the sons of Qohath in the Tent of Appointment.
\p
\v 16 The duty of Elazar the son of Aharon the priest shall be the oil for the light, the sweet incense, the continual meal offering, and the anointing oil, the requirements of all the Tabernacle, and of all that is in it, the set-apart place, and its furnishings."
\p
\v 17 יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
\v 18 "Do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Qohathites from among the Levites;
\v 19 but thus do to them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach to the most set-apart things: Aharon and his sons shall go in, and appoint them everyone to his service and to his burden;
\v 20 but they shall not go in to see the set-apart place even for a moment, lest they die."

\v 21 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 22 "Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers' houses, by their families;
\v 23 you shall count them from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old; all who enter in to wait upon the host, to do the service in the Tent of Appointment.
\v 24 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in \add bearing\add* burdens:
\v 25 they shall carry the curtains of the Tabernacle, and the Tent of Appointment, its covering, and the covering of taḥash skin that is above on it, and the screen for the door of the Tent of Appointment,
\v 26 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the Tabernacle and around the altar, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and whatever shall be done with them. Therein shall they serve.
\v 27 At the command of Aharon and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service; and you shall appoint their duty to them in all their burdens.
\v 28 This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the Tent of Appointment: and their duty shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aharon the priest.
\p
\v 29 "As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families, by their fathers' houses;
\v 30 you shall count them from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who enters the host, to do the service of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 31 This is the duty of their burden, according to all their service in the Tent of Appointment: the Tabernacle's boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
\v 32 and the pillars of the court around it, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name you shall appoint the instruments of the duty of their burden.
\v 33 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the Tent of Appointment, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aharon the priest."
\p
\v 34 Mosheh and Aharon and the princes of the congregation numbered the sons of the Qohathites by their families, and by their fathers' houses,
\v 35 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered into the host, for service in the Tent of Appointment.
\v 36 Those who were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred fifty.
\v 37 These are those who were numbered of the families of the Qohathites, all who served in the Tent of Appointment, whom Mosheh and Aharon numbered according to the command of יהוה by Mosheh.
\p
\v 38 Those who were numbered of the sons of Gershon, their families, and by their fathers' houses,

\v 45 These are those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Mosheh and Aharon numbered according to the command of יהוה by Mosheh.
\p
\v 46 All those who were numbered of the Levites, whom Mosheh and Aharon and the princes of Yisra'el numbered, by their families, and by their fathers' houses,
\v 47 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered in to do the service of service, and the service of \add bearing\add* burdens in the Tent of Appointment,
\v 48 even those who were numbered of them, were eight thousand five hundred eighty.
\v 49 According to the command of יהוה they were numbered by Mosheh, everyone according to his service, and according to his burden. Thus were they numbered by him, as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Command the children of Yisra'el that they put out of the camp every leper, and everyone who has an issue, and whoever is defiled for a being.
\v 3 Both you shall put male and female outside of the camp; that they not defile their camp, in the midst of which I dwell."
\v 4 The children of Yisra'el did so, and put them out outside of the camp; as יהוה spoke to Mosheh, so did the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 5 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 6 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el: 'When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against יהוה, and that being is guilty;
\v 7 then he shall confess his sin which he has done, and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom he has been guilty.
\v 8 But if the man has no redeemer to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to יהוה shall be the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement shall be made for him.
\v 9 Every heave offering of all the set-apart things of the children of Yisra'el, which they present to the priest, shall be his.
\v 10 Every man's set-apart things shall be his: whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.'"
\p
\v 11 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 12 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them: 'If any man's wife goes astray, and is treacherous to him,
\v 13 and a man lies with her carnally, \add giving\add* seed, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and is kept close, and she is defiled, and there is no witness against her, and she is not taken in the act;
\v 14 and the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she is defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she is not defiled:
\v 15 then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring her offering for her: the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal. He shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense on it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to memory.
\p
\v 16 The priest shall bring her near, and set her before יהוה;
\v 17 and the priest shall take set-apart water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the Tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water.
\v 18 The priest shall set the woman before יהוה, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal offering of jealousy. The priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that brings a curse.
\v 19 The priest shall cause her to swear, and shall tell the woman, "If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under your husband, be free from this water of bitterness that brings a curse.
\v 20 But if you have gone astray, being under your husband, and if you are defiled, and some man has \add had\add* relations with you besides your husband:"
\v 21 then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall tell the woman, "יהוה make you a curse and an oath among your people, when יהוה allows your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell;
\v 22 and this water that brings a curse will go into your gut, and make your belly swell, and your thigh fall away." The woman shall say, "Amein, Amein."
\p
\v 23 "'The priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness.
\v 24 He shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse; and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.
\v 25 The priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the meal offering before יהוה, and bring it to the altar.
\v 26 The priest shall take a handful of the meal offering, as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
\v 27 When he has made her drink the water, then it shall happen, if she is defiled, and has committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse will enter into her and become bitter, and her body will swell, and her thigh will fall away: and the woman will be a curse among her people.
\v 28 If the woman is not defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
\p
\v 29 This is the Torah of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goes astray, and is defiled;
\v 30 or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then he shall set the woman before יהוה, and the priest shall carry out on her all this Torah.
\v 31 The man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.'"

\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them: 'When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of \add the\add* separated,\f + \fr 6:2 \fk Separated \ft Commonly, "Nazirite."\f* to distinguish himself to יהוה,
\v 3 he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of fermented drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.
\v 4 All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the seeds even to the skins.
\p
\v 5 All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall come on his head, until the days are fulfilled, in which he separates himself to יהוה. He shall be set-apart. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
\p
\v 6 All the days that he separates himself to יהוה he shall not go near a dead body.
\v 7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation to Elohim is on his head.
\v 8 All the days of his separation he is set-apart to יהוה.
\p
\v 9 If any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing. On the seventh day he shall shave it.
\v 10 On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 11 The priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other for an ascension offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by the being \add of a man\add*, and shall make his head set-apart that same day.
\v 12 He shall separate to יהוה the days of his separation, and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.
\p
\v 13 This is the Torah of the separated: when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the Tent of Appointment,
\v 14 and he shall offer his offering to יהוה, one male lamb a year old without blemish for an ascension offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
\v 15 and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.
\v 16 The priest shall present them before יהוה, and shall offer his sin offering, and his ascension offering.
\v 17 He shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to יהוה, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also its meal offering, and its drink offering.
\v 18 The separated shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the Tent of Appointment, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.
\v 19 The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the separated, after he has shaved the head of his separation;
\v 20 and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before יהוה. This is set-apart for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered. After that the separated may drink wine.
\p
\v 21 This is the Torah of the separated who vows, and of his offering to יהוה for his separation, besides that which he is able to get. According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the Torah of his separation.'"
\p
\v 22 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 23 "Speak to Aharon and to his sons, saying, 'This is how you shall bless the children of Yisra'el.' You shall tell them,
\p
\v 24 'יהוה bless you, and guard you.
\v 25 יהוה make His face to shine on you, and grant you favor.
\v 26 יהוה lift up His face upon you, and give you peace.'
\v 27 So they shall put My Name on the children of Yisra'el; and I will bless them."
\c 7
\p
\v 1 It happened on the day that Mosheh had finished setting up the Tabernacle, and had anointed it and set it apart, with all its furniture, and the altar with all its vessels, and had anointed and set them apart;
\v 2 that the princes of Yisra'el, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes. These are they who were over those who were numbered:
\v 3 and they brought their offering before יהוה, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the Tabernacle.
\p
\v 4 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 5 "Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Appointment; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service."
\v 6 Mosheh took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
\v 7 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service:
\v 8 and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aharon the priest.
\v 9 But to the sons of Qohath he gave none, because the service of the set-apart place belonged to them; they carried it on their shoulders.
\p
\v 10 The princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes gave their offerings before the altar.
\v 11 יהוה said to Mosheh, "They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar."
\p
\v 12 He who offered his offering the first day was Naḥshon the son of Amminadav, of the tribe of Yehudah,

\p
\v 89 When Mosheh went into the Tent of Appointment to speak with יהוה, he heard His voice speaking to him from above the lid that was on the ark of the witness, from between the two keruvim, and He spoke to him.
\c 8
\ms פרשת בהעלתך – Parashat Beha'alotekha
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to Aharon, and tell him, 'When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the menorah.'"
\v 3 Aharon did so. He lit its lamps to light the area in front of the menorah, as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\v 4 This was the workmanship of the menorah, beaten work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work: according to the pattern which יהוה had shown Mosheh, so he made the menorah.
\p
\v 5 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 6 "Take the Levites from among the children of Yisra'el, and cleanse them.
\v 7 You shall do this to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of sin offering on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
\v 8 Then let them take a young bull, and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering.
\v 9 You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Appointment. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 10 You shall present the Levites before יהוה. The children of Yisra'el shall lay their hands on the Levites,
\v 11 and Aharon shall offer the Levites before יהוה for a wave offering, on the behalf of the children of Yisra'el, that it may be theirs to do the service of יהוה.
\v 12 "The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for an ascension offering to יהוה, to make atonement for the Levites.
\v 13 You shall set the Levites before Aharon, and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to יהוה.
\p
\v 14 Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Yisra'el, and the Levites shall be Mine.
\v 15 "After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Appointment: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering.
\v 16 For they are wholly given to Me from among the children of Yisra'el; instead of all who open the womb,\f + \fr 8:16 \ft See footnote at Shemoth 13:2.\f* even the firstborn of all the children of Yisra'el, I have taken them to Me.
\v 17 For all the firstborn among the children of Yisra'el are Mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Mitsrayim, I set them apart for Myself.
\v 18 I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Yisra'el.
\v 19 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aharon and to his sons from among the children of Yisra'el, to do the service of the children of Yisra'el in the Tent of Appointment, and to make atonement for the children of Yisra'el; that there be no plague among the children of Yisra'el, when the children of Yisra'el come near to the set-apart place."
\p
\v 20 Mosheh, and Aharon, and all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el did so to the Levites. According to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh concerning the Levites, so the children of Yisra'el did to them.
\v 21 The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aharon offered them for a wave offering before יהוה; and Aharon made atonement for them to cleanse them.
\v 22 After that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Appointment before Aharon, and before his sons: as יהוה had commanded Mosheh concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
\p
\v 23 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 24 "This is that which belongs to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the host in the service of the Tent of Appointment;
\v 25 and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the service, and shall serve no more,
\v 26 but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent of Appointment, to guard the charge, and shall do no service. You shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties."
\c 9
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first new moon of the second year after they had come out of the land of Mitsrayim, saying,
\v 2 "Moreover let the children of Yisra'el keep the Pesaḥ in its appointed season.
\v 3 On the fourteenth day of this new moon, between the evenings, you shall keep it in its appointed season—according to all its statutes, and according to all its judgments, you shall keep it."
\v 4 Mosheh spoke to the children of Yisra'el, that they should keep the Pesaḥ.
\v 5 They kept the Pesaḥ in the first new moon, on the fourteenth day of the new moon, between the evenings, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh, so the children of Yisra'el did.
\v 6 There were certain men, who were defiled for the being of a man, so that they could not keep the Pesaḥ on that day, and they came before Mosheh and before Aharon on that day.
\v 7 Those men said to him, "We are defiled because of the being of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of יהוה in its appointed time among the children of Yisra'el?"
\v 8 Mosheh answered them, "Wait, that I may hear what יהוה will command concerning you."
\p
\v 9 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 10 "Say to the children of Yisra'el, 'If any man of you or of your generations becomes defiled for the being \add of a man\add*, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Pesaḥ to יהוה.
\v 11 In the second new moon, on the fourteenth day between the evenings they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
\v 12 They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Pesaḥ they shall keep it.
\v 13 But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Pesaḥ, that being shall be cut off from his people. Because he did not offer the offering of יהוה in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
\p
\v 14 If a sojourner lives among you, and desires to keep the Pesaḥ to יהוה; according to the statute of the Pesaḥ, and according to its judgment, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for the native-born.'"
\p
\v 15 On the day that the Tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the Tabernacle, even the Tabernacle of the witness: and at evening it was over the Tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.
\v 16 So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
\v 17 Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Yisra'el traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Yisra'el encamped.
\v 18 At the command of יהוה, the children of Yisra'el traveled, and at the command of יהוה they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the Tabernacle they remained encamped.
\v 19 When the cloud stayed on the Tabernacle many days, then the children of Yisra'el guarded the command of יהוה, and did not travel.
\v 20 Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the Tabernacle; then according to the command of יהוה they remained encamped, and according to the command of יהוה they traveled.
\v 21 Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled: or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.
\v 22 Whether it was two days, or a new moon, or a year that the cloud stayed on the Tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Yisra'el remained encamped, and did not travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled.
\v 23 At the command of יהוה they encamped, and at the command of יהוה they traveled. They guarded the command of יהוה, at the command of יהוה by Mosheh.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling \add together\add* of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.
\v 3 When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 4 If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Yisra'el, shall gather themselves to you.
\v 5 When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.
\v 6 When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
\v 7 But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
\v 8 The sons of Aharon, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.
\v 9 When you go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before יהוה your Elohim, and you will be saved from your enemies.
\v 10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set Feasts, and in the beginnings of your new moons, you shall blow the trumpets over your ascension offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your Elohim. I am יהוה your Elohim."
\p
\v 11 It happened in the second year, in the second new moon, on the twentieth day of the new moon, that the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle of the witness.
\v 12 The children of Yisra'el went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.
\v 13 They first went forward according to the command of יהוה by Mosheh.
\v 14 First, the standard of the camp of the children of Yehudah went forward according to their armies. Naḥshon the son of Amminadav was over his army.
\v 15 Nethan'el the son of Tsuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Yissakhar.
\v 16 Eliav the son of Ḥelon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zevulun.
\p
\v 17 The Tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the Tabernacle, went forward.
\v 18 The standard of the camp of Reuven went forward according to their armies. Elitsur the son of Shedeur was over his army.
\v 19 Shelumi'el the son of Tsurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the children of Shimon.
\v 20 Eliasaph the son of Deu'el was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad.

\v 21 The Qohathites set forward, bearing the set-apart place. The others set up the Tabernacle before they arrived.
\v 22 The standard of the camp of the children of Ephrayim set forward according to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army.
\v 23 Gamali'el the son of Pedahtsur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Menasheh.
\v 24 Avidan the son of Gidoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benyamin.
\p
\v 25 The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Aḥiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army.
\v 26 Pagi'el the son of Oḥran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher.
\v 27 Aḥira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali.
\v 28 Thus were the travels of the children of Yisra'el according to their armies; and they went forward.
\p
\v 29 Mosheh said to Ḥovav, the son of Reu'el the Midianite, Mosheh's father-in-law, "We are journeying to the place of which יהוה said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us, and we will treat you well; for יהוה has spoken good concerning Yisra'el."
\v 30 He said to him, "I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives."
\v 31 He said, "Do not leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.
\v 32 It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever good יהוה does to us, we will do the same to you."
\p
\v 33 They set forward from the Mount of יהוה three days' journey. The ark of the covenant of יהוה went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them.
\v 34 The cloud of יהוה was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.
\p
\v 35 It happened, when the ark went forward, that Mosheh said, "Rise up, יהוה, and let Your enemies be scattered! Let those who hate You flee before You!"
\v 36 When it rested, he said, "Return, יהוה, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Yisra'el."
\c 11
\p
\v 1 The people were complaining in the ears of יהוה. When יהוה heard it, His anger was kindled; and the fire of יהוה burnt among them, and consumed \add some\add* of the outskirts of the camp.
\v 2 The people cried out to Mosheh; and Mosheh prayed to יהוה, and the fire abated.
\v 3 The name of that place was called Taverah, because the fire of יהוה burnt among them.
\p
\v 4 The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Yisra'el also wept again, and said, "Who will give us flesh to eat?
\v 5 We remember the fish, which we ate in Mitsrayim for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;
\v 6 but now our being is dried up. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at."
\p
\v 7 The manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.
\v 8 The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and cooked it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.
\v 9 When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.
\p
\v 10 Mosheh heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of יהוה was kindled greatly; and Mosheh was displeased.
\v 11 Mosheh said to יהוה, "Why have you treated with Your servant so badly? Why have I not found favor in Your eyes, that You lay the burden of all this people on me?
\v 12 Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them forth, that You should tell me, 'Carry them in your bosom, as a faithful \add nurse\add* carries a nursing infant, to the land which You swore to their fathers?'
\v 13 Where could I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, 'Give us meat, that we may eat.'
\v 14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
\v 15 If You treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor in Your eyes; and let me not see my wretchedness."
\p
\v 16 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Yisra'el, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Appointment, that they may stand there with you.
\v 17 I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Ruaḥ which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.
\p
\v 18 Say to the people, 'Set yourselves apart for tomorrow, and you will eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of יהוה, saying, "Who will give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Mitsrayim." Therefore יהוה will give you flesh, and you will eat.
\v 19 You will not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,
\v 20 but a whole new moon, until it come out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because that you have rejected יהוה who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, "Why did we come out of Mitsrayim?"'"
\p
\v 21 Mosheh said, "The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, 'I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole new moon.'
\v 22 Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?"
\v 23 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Has the Hand of יהוה grown short? Now you will see whether My word will happen to you or not."
\p
\v 24 Mosheh went out, and told the people the words of יהוה; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.
\v 25 יהוה came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Ruaḥ that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders: and it came about that the Ruaḥ rested on them, and they prophesied, but they did so no more.
\p
\v 26 But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Ruaḥ rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
\v 27 A young man ran, and told Mosheh, and said, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!"
\v 28 Yehoshua the son of Nun, the servant of Mosheh, one of his chosen men, answered, "My master Mosheh, forbid them!"
\v 29 Mosheh said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Oh that all the people of יהוה were prophets, that יהוה would put His Ruaḥ on them!"
\v 30 Mosheh went into the camp, he and the elders of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 31 A wind from יהוה went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.
\v 32 The people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten omers; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp.
\v 33 While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was cut, the anger of יהוה was kindled against the people, and יהוה struck the people with a very great plague.
\v 34 The name of that place was called Qivroth Hatta'avah,\f + \fr 11:34 \fk קברות התאוה (Qivroth Hatta'avah) \ft From the Hebrew words קבר (q'bair) meaning "grave" and תאוה (ta'avah) meaning "desire" or "lust:" "Grave of desire" or "Grave of lusting."\f* because there they buried the people who lusted.
\v 35 From Qivroth Hatta'avah the people traveled to Ḥatseroth; and they stayed at Ḥatseroth.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Miryam and Aharon spoke against Mosheh because of the Kushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Kushite woman.
\v 2 They said, "Has יהוה indeed spoken only with Mosheh? Has He not spoken also with us?" And יהוה heard it.
\v 3 Now the man Mosheh was very humble, above all the men who were on the surface of the earth.
\v 4 יהוה spoke suddenly to Mosheh, to Aharon, and to Miryam, "You three come out to the Tent of Appointment!" The three of them came out.
\v 5 יהוה came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aharon and Miryam; and they both came forward.
\p
\v 6 He said, "Hear now My words. If there is a prophet among you, I יהוה will make Myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.
\v 7 My servant Mosheh is not so. He is faithful in all My house.
\v 8 With him I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see the form of יהוה. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Mosheh?"
\p
\v 9 The anger of יהוה was kindled against them; and He departed.
\v 10 The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miryam was leprous, as white as snow. Aharon looked at Miryam, and behold, she was leprous.
\v 11 Aharon said to Mosheh, "Oh, my master, please do not count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.
\v 12 Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb."
\v 13 Mosheh cried to יהוה, saying, "Heal her, O El, I beg You!"
\v 14 יהוה said to Mosheh, "If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be closed up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again."
\v 15 Miryam was closed up outside of the camp seven days, and the people did not travel until Miryam was brought in again.
\p
\v 16 Afterward the people traveled from Ḥatseroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
\c 13
\ms פרשת שלח-לך – Parashat Sh'laḥ Lekha
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Send men, that they may spy out the land of Kena'an, which I give to the children of Yisra'el. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince among them."
\v 3 Mosheh sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the command of יהוה: all of them men who were heads of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 4 These were their names: Of the tribe of Reuven, Shammua the son of Zakkur.
\v 5 Of the tribe of Shimon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
\v 6 Of the tribe of Yehudah, Kalev the son of Yephunneh.
\v 7 Of the tribe of Yissakhar, Igal the son of Yoseph.
\v 8 Of the tribe of Ephrayim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
\v 9 Of the tribe of Benyamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
\v 10 Of the tribe of Zevulun, Gaddi'el the son of Sodi.
\v 11 Of the tribe of Yoseph, \add namely,\add* of the tribe of Menasheh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
\v 12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammi'el the son of Gemalli.
\v 13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Mikha'el.
\v 14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Naḥbi the son of Vophsi.
\v 15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geu'el the son of Maḥi.
\v 16 These are the names of the men who Mosheh sent to spy out the land. Mosheh called Hoshea the son of Nun Yehoshua.
\p
\v 17 Mosheh sent them to spy out the land of Kena'an, and said to them, "Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country:
\v 18 and see the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;
\v 19 and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;
\v 20 and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be strengthened, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes."
\p
\v 21 So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Tsin to Reḥov, to the entrance of Ḥamath.
\v 22 They went up by the South, and came to Ḥevron; and Aḥiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anaq, were there. (Now Ḥevron was built seven years before Tsoan in Mitsrayim.)
\p
\v 23 They came to the wadi Eshkol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two \add men\add*; \add they\add* also brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
\v 24 That place was called the wadi Eshkol, because of the cluster which the children of Yisra'el cut down from there.
\p
\v 25 They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
\v 26 They went and came to Mosheh, and to Aharon, and to all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, to the wilderness of Paran, to Qadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
\v 27 They told him, and said, "We came to the land where you sent us; and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is its fruit.
\v 28 However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, \add and\add* very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anaq there.
\v 29 Amaleq dwells in the land of the South: and the Ḥittite, and the Yevusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill country; and the Kena'anite dwells by the sea, and along by the side of the Yarden."
\p
\v 30 Kalev stilled the people before Mosheh, and said, "Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it."
\v 31 But the men who went up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we."
\v 32 They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Yisra'el, saying, "The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.
\v 33 There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anaq, of the Nephilim: and we were in our own eyes as grasshoppers, and so we were in their eyes."
\c 14
\p
\v 1 All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
\v 2 All the children of Yisra'el grumbled against Mosheh and against Aharon: and the whole congregation said to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Mitsrayim! or would that we had died in this wilderness!
\v 3 Why does יהוה bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be \add for\add* plunder: would not it be better for us to return into Mitsrayim?"
\v 4 They said one to another, "Let us make a captain, and let us return into Mitsrayim."
\p
\v 5 Then Mosheh and Aharon fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 6 Yehoshua the son of Nun and Kalev the son of Yephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes:
\v 7 and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, saying, "The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.
\v 8 If יהוה delights in us, then He will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.
\v 9 Only do not rebel against יהוה, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is removed from over them, and יהוה is with us. Do not fear them."
\v 10 But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. The glory of יהוה appeared in the Tent of Appointment to all the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 11 יהוה said to Mosheh, "How long will this people despise Me? And how long will they not trust in Me, for all the signs which I have worked among them?
\v 12 I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they."
\p
\v 13 Mosheh said to יהוה, "Then the Mitsrites will hear it; for You brought up this people in Your might from among them;
\v 14 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You יהוה are in the midst of this people; for You יהוה are seen face to face, and Your cloud stands over them, and You go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\v 15 Now if You killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the report of You will speak, saying,
\v 16 'Because יהוה was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to them, therefore He has slain them in the wilderness.'
\v 17 Now please let the power of יהוה be great, according as You have spoken, saying,
\v 18 'יהוה is slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means clear \add the guilty\add*, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.'
\v 19 Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your loving-kindness, and according as You have forgiven this people, from Mitsrayim even until now."
\p
\v 20 יהוה said, "I have pardoned according to your word:
\v 21 but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of יהוה;
\v 22 because all those men who have seen My glory, and My signs, which I worked in Mitsrayim and in the wilderness, yet have tempted Me these ten times, and have not listened to My voice;
\v 23 surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised Me see it:
\v 24 but My servant Kalev, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed Me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.
\v 25 Now the Amaleqite and the Kena'anite dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn, and go into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Reeds."
\p
\v 26 יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
\v 27 "How long \add shall I bear\add* with this evil congregation, grumble against Me? I have heard the grumblings of the children of Yisra'el, which they grumble against Me.
\v 28 Tell them, 'As I live, says יהוה, surely as you have spoken in My ears, so will I do to you:
\v 29 your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against Me,
\v 30 surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Kalev the son of Yephunneh, and Yehoshua the son of Nun.
\v 31 But your little ones, that you said should be \add for\add* plunder, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.
\v 32 But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
\v 33 Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoring, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.
\v 34 After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know My opposition.'
\v 35 I, יהוה, have spoken, surely I will do this to all this evil congregation, who are gathered together against Me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die."
\p
\v 36 The men, whom Mosheh sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to grumble against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,
\v 37 even those men who did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before יהוה.
\v 38 But Yehoshua the son of Nun, and Kalev the son of Yephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.
\p
\v 39 Mosheh told these words to all the children of Yisra'el: and the people mourned greatly.
\p
\v 40 They rose up early in the morning, and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, "Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which יהוה has promised: for we have sinned."
\v 41 Mosheh said, "Why now do you disobey the command of יהוה, since it shall not prosper?
\v 42 Do not go up, for יהוה is not among you; that you not be struck down before your enemies.
\v 43 For there the Amaleqite and the Kena'anite are before you, and you shall fall by the sword: because you are turned back from following יהוה, therefore יהוה will not be with you."
\p
\v 44 But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of יהוה, and Mosheh, did not depart out of the camp.
\v 45 Then the Amaleqite came down, and the Kena'anite who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down, even to Ḥormah.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them, 'When you have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,
\v 3 and will make an offering by fire to יהוה, an ascension offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow or as a freewill offering, or in your set Feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to יהוה, of the herd, or of the flock;
\v 4 then he who offers his offering shall offer to יהוה a meal offering of a tenth part \add of an ephah\add* of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil:
\v 5 and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin, you shall prepare with the ascension offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
\v 6 Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts \add of an ephah\add* of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil:
\v 7 and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, for a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\v 8 When you prepare a bull for an ascension offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow or for peace offerings to יהוה;
\v 9 then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts \add of an ephah\add* of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil:
\v 10 and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, for a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\p
\v 11 Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats.
\v 12 According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.
\v 13 All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\p
\v 14 If a sojourner dwells with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a soothing aroma to יהוה; as you do, so he shall do.
\v 15 For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the sojourner who dwells \add with you\add*, a statute forever throughout your generations: as you are, so shall the sojourner be before יהוה.
\v 16 One Torah and one judgment shall be for you, and for the sojourner who dwells with you.'"
\p
\v 17 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 18 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them, 'When you come into the land where I bring you,
\v 19 then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to יהוה.
\v 20 Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering: as the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it.
\v 21 Of the first of your dough you shall give to יהוה a wave offering throughout your generations.
\p
\v 22 When you shall err, and not observe all these commands, which יהוה has spoken to Mosheh,
\v 23 even all that יהוה has commanded you by Mosheh, from the day that יהוה gave command, and onward throughout your generations;
\v 24 then it shall be, if it be done unknowingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for an ascension offering, for a soothing aroma to יהוה, with the meal offering of it, and the drink offering of it, according to the judgment, and one male goat for a sin offering.
\v 25 The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, and they shall be forgiven; for it was \add done\add* unknowingly, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to יהוה, and their sin offering before יהוה, for \add doing it\add* unknowingly:
\v 26 and all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el shall be forgiven, and the sojourner who dwells among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unknowingly.
\p
\v 27 If one person sins unknowingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.
\v 28 The priest shall make atonement for the being who \add does\add* unknowingly, when he sins unknowingly, before יהוה, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.
\v 29 You shall have one Torah for him who does \add anything\add* unknowingly, for him who is native-born among the children of Yisra'el, and for the sojourner who dwells among them.
\v 30 But the being who does anything deceptively with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemes יהוה; and that being shall be cut off from among his people.
\v 31 Because he has despised the word of יהוה, and has broken His command, that being shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.'"
\p
\v 32 While the children of Yisra'el were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.
\v 33 Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Mosheh and Aharon, and to all the congregation.
\v 34 They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
\v 35 יהוה said to Mosheh, "The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp."
\v 36 All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 37 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 38 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them to make themselves tsitsit on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the tsitsit of each border a cord of blue:
\v 39 and it shall be to you for a tsitsit, that you may look on it, and remember all the commands of יהוה, and do them; and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you used to whore;
\v 40 that you may remember and do all My commands, and be set-apart to your Elohim.
\v 41 I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, to be your Elohim: I am יהוה your Elohim."

\ms פרשת קרח – Parashat Qoraḥ
\p
\v 1 Now Qoraḥ, the son of Yitshar, the son of Qohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuven, took \add men\add*:
\v 2 and they rose up before Mosheh, with certain of the children of Yisra'el, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;
\v 3 and they assembled themselves together against Mosheh and against Aharon, and said to them, "You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are set-apart, everyone of them, and יהוה is among them: why then lift yourselves up above the assembly of יהוה?"
\p
\v 4 When Mosheh heard it, he fell on his face:
\v 5 and he spoke to Qoraḥ and to all his company, saying, "In the morning יהוה will show who are His, and who is set-apart, and will cause \add him\add* to come near to Him: even \add him\add* whom He shall choose He will cause to come near to Him.
\v 6 Do this: take censers, Qoraḥ, and all his company;
\v 7 and put fire in them, and put incense on them before יהוה tomorrow: and it shall be that the man whom יהוה chooses, he shall be set-apart. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!"
\p
\v 8 Mosheh said to Qoraḥ, "Hear now, you sons of Levi!
\v 9 Is it a small thing to you, that the Elohim of Yisra'el has separated you from the congregation of Yisra'el, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the Tabernacle of יהוה, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;
\v 10 and that He has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And do you seek the priesthood also?
\v 11 Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against יהוה: and Aharon, what is he that you grumble against him?"
\p
\v 12 Mosheh sent to call Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav; and they said, "We will not come up:
\v 13 is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?
\v 14 Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up."
\p
\v 15 Mosheh was very angry, and said to יהוה, "Do not respect their offering: I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them."
\v 16 Mosheh said to Qoraḥ, "You and all your company go before יהוה, you, and they, and Aharon, tomorrow:
\v 17 and each man take his censer, and put incense on them, and each man bring his censer before יהוה, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aharon, each his censer."
\v 18 They each took his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the Tent of Appointment with Mosheh and Aharon.
\v 19 Qoraḥ assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the Tent of Appointment: and the glory of יהוה appeared to all the congregation.
\p
\v 20 יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
\v 21 "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!"
\v 22 They fell on their faces, and said, "El, the Elohim of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?"
\p
\v 23 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 24 "Speak to the congregation, saying, 'Get away from around the tabernacle of Qoraḥ, Dathan, and Aviram!'"
\p
\v 25 Mosheh rose up and went to Dathan and Aviram; and the elders of Yisra'el followed him.
\v 26 He spoke to the congregation, saying, "Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!"
\v 27 So they went away from the tabernacle of Qoraḥ, Dathan, and Aviram, on every side: and Dathan and Aviram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.
\v 28 Mosheh said, "Hereby you shall know that יהוה has sent me to do all these works; for \add I have\add* not \add done them\add* of my own mind.
\v 29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then יהוה has not sent me.
\v 30 But if יהוה make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall understand that these men have despised יהוה."
\p
\v 31 It happened, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart that was under them;
\v 32 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who appertained to Qoraḥ, and all their goods.
\v 33 So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.
\v 34 All Yisra'el that were around them fled at the cry of them; for they said, "Lest the earth swallow us up!"
\v 35 Fire came forth from יהוה, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.
\p
\v 36 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 37 "Speak to Elazar the son of Aharon the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire yonder; for they are set-apart,
\v 38 even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before יהוה; therefore they are set-apart; and they shall be a sign to the children of Yisra'el."
\v 39 Elazar the priest took the copper censers, which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,
\v 40 to be a memorial to the children of Yisra'el, to the end that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aharon, comes near to burn incense before יהוה; that he not be as Qoraḥ, and as his company: as יהוה spoke to him by Mosheh.
\p
\v 41 But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el grumbled against Mosheh and against Aharon, saying, "You have killed the people of יהוה!"
\v 42 It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Mosheh and against Aharon, that they looked toward the Tent of Appointment: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of יהוה appeared.
\v 43 Mosheh and Aharon came to the front of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 44 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 45 "Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!" They fell on their faces.
\v 46 Mosheh said to Aharon, "Take your censer, and put fire from off the altar in it, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from יהוה! The plague has begun."
\v 47 Aharon did as Mosheh said, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague has begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
\v 48 He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
\v 49 Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Qoraḥ.
\v 50 Aharon returned to Mosheh to the door of the Tent of Appointment: and the plague was stayed.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write every man's name on his rod.
\v 3 You shall write Aharon's name on the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.
\v 4 You shall lay them up in the Tent of Appointment before the witness, where I meet with you.
\v 5 It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from Me the grumblings of the children of Yisra'el, which they grumble against you."
\v 6 Mosheh spoke to the children of Yisra'el; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aharon was among their rods.
\v 7 Mosheh laid up the rods before יהוה in the tent of the witness.
\p
\v 8 It happened on the next day, that Mosheh went into the tent of the witness; and behold, the rod of Aharon for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.
\v 9 Mosheh brought out all the rods from before יהוה to all the children of Yisra'el: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
\v 10 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Put back the rod of Aharon before the witness, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me, that they not die."
\v 11 And Mosheh did so. As יהוה commanded him, so he did.
\p
\v 12 The children of Yisra'el spoke to Mosheh, saying, "Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are all undone!
\v 13 Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the Tabernacle of יהוה, dies! Will we all perish?"
\c 18
\p
\v 1 יהוה said to Aharon, "You and your sons and your fathers' house with you shall bear the iniquity of the set-apart place; and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
\v 2 Your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you shall be before the tent of the witness.
\v 3 They shall guard your commands, and the duty of all the Tent: only they shall not come near to the vessels of the set-apart place and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you.
\v 4 They shall be joined to you, and guard the responsibility of the Tent of Appointment, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come near to you.
\v 5 You shall guard the charge of the set-apart place, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more on the children of Yisra'el.
\v 6 I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Yisra'el: to you they are a gift, given to יהוה, to do the service of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 7 You and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and you shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death."
\p
\v 8 יהוה spoke to Aharon, "I, behold, I have given you the command of My wave offerings, even all the set-apart things of the children of Yisra'el; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion forever.
\v 9 This shall be yours of the most set-apart things, \add reserved\add* from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every guilt offering of theirs, which they shall render to Me, shall be most set-apart for you and for your sons.
\v 10 You shall eat of it like the most set-apart things. Every male shall eat of it. It shall be set-apart to you.
\p
\v 11 "This is yours, too: the wave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Yisra'el. I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion forever. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.
\v 12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to יהוה, to you have I given them.
\v 13 The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to יהוה, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.
\v 14 Everything devoted in Yisra'el shall be yours.
\v 15 Everything that opens the womb,\f + \fr 18:15 \ft See footnote at Shemoth 13:2.\f* of all flesh which they offer to יהוה, both of man and animal shall be yours: nevertheless you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man, and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals.
\v 16 You shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a new moon old, according to your estimation, for five sheqels of money, after the sheqel of the set-apart place (the same is twenty gerahs).
\v 17 But you shall not redeem the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat. They are set-apart. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\v 18 Their flesh shall be yours, as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours.
\v 19 All the wave offerings of the set-apart things, which the children of Yisra'el offer to יהוה, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever: it is a covenant of salt forever before יהוה to you and to your seed with you."
\p
\v 20 יהוה said to Aharon, "You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 21 To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Yisra'el for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 22 Henceforth the children of Yisra'el shall not come near the Tent of Appointment, lest they bear sin, and die.
\v 23 But the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Appointment, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations; and among the children of Yisra'el they shall have no inheritance.
\v 24 For the tithe of the children of Yisra'el, which they offer as a wave offering to יהוה, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said to them, 'Among the children of Yisra'el they shall have no inheritance.'"
\p
\v 25 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 26 "Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them, 'When you take of the children of Yisra'el the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for יהוה, a tithe of the tithe.
\v 27 Your wave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the winepress.
\v 28 Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to יהוה of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Yisra'el; and of it you shall give the wave offering of יהוה to Aharon the priest.
\v 29 Out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering of יהוה, of all its best, even the set-apart part of it out of it.'
\v 30 Therefore you shall tell them, 'When you heave its best from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the winepress.
\v 31 You shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Appointment.
\v 32 You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it its best: and you shall not profane the set-apart things of the children of Yisra'el, that you not die.'"
\c 19
\ms פרשת חקת – Parashat Ḥuqat
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
\v 2 "This is the statute of the Torah which יהוה has commanded: Speak to the children of Yisra'el, that they bring you a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish, \add and\add* on which never came a yoke.
\v 3 You shall give her to Elazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face:
\v 4 and Elazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the Tent of Appointment seven times.
\v 5 One shall burn the heifer in his eyes; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
\v 6 and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
\v 7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.
\v 8 He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
\v 9 A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Yisra'el for a water for impurity: it is a sin offering.
\v 10 He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be to the children of Yisra'el, and to the sojourner who dwells among them, for a statute forever.
\p
\v 11 He who touches the dead being of man shall be unclean seven days:
\v 12 the same shall purify himself with \add the water\add* on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he does not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
\v 13 Whoever touches a dead being, the body of man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the Tabernacle of יהוה; and that being shall be cut off from Yisra'el: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.
\p
\v 14 This is the Torah \add for\add* when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
\v 15 Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.
\v 16 Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead \add body\add*, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
\v 17 For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
\v 18 and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:
\v 19 and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.
\p
\v 20 But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that being shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the set-apart place of יהוה: the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.
\v 21 It shall be a perpetual statute to them: and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
\v 22 Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the being that touches it shall be unclean until evening."
\c 20
\p
\v 1 The children of Yisra'el, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Tsin in the first new moon: and the people stayed in Qadesh; and Miryam died there, and was buried there.
\p
\v 2 There was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Mosheh and against Aharon.
\v 3 The people strove with Mosheh, and spoke, saying, "Oh that we had died when our brothers died before יהוה!
\v 4 Why have you brought the assembly of יהוה into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals?
\v 5 Why have you made us to come up out of Mitsrayim, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink."
\v 6 Mosheh and Aharon went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Appointment, and fell on their faces: and the glory of יהוה appeared to them.
\v 7 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\p
\v 8 "Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aharon your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink."
\p
\v 9 Mosheh took the rod from before יהוה, as He commanded him.
\v 10 Mosheh and Aharon gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you?"
\v 11 Mosheh lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.
\v 12 יהוה said to Mosheh and Aharon, "Because you did not trust in Me, to treat Me as set-apart in the eyes of the children of Yisra'el, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."
\v 13 These are the waters of Merivah; because the children of Yisra'el strove with יהוה, and He was set-apart in them.
\p
\v 14 Mosheh sent messengers from Qadesh to the king of Edom, saying: "Thus says your brother Yisra'el: 'You know all the travail that has happened to us:
\v 15 how our fathers went down into Mitsrayim, and we lived in Mitsrayim a long time; and the Mitsrites dealt ill with us, and our fathers:
\v 16 and when we cried to יהוה, He heard our voice, and sent a messenger, and brought us forth out of Mitsrayim: and behold, we are in Qadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.
\v 17 Please let us pass through your land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border.'"
\p
\v 18 Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you."
\v 19 The children of Yisra'el said to him, "We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then I will give its price: let me only, without \add doing\add* anything \add else\add*, pass through on my feet."
\v 20 He said, "You shall not pass through." Edom came out against him with heavy people, and with a strong hand.
\v 21 Thus Edom refused to give Yisra'el passage through his border, so Yisra'el turned away from him.
\p
\v 22 They traveled from Qadesh: and the children of Yisra'el, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
\p
\v 23 יהוה spoke to Mosheh and Aharon in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
\v 24 "Aharon shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Yisra'el, because you rebelled against My word at the waters of Merivah.
\v 25 Take Aharon and Elazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;
\v 26 and strip Aharon of his garments, and put them on Elazar his son: and Aharon shall be gathered \add to his people\add*, and shall die there."
\v 27 Mosheh did as יהוה commanded: and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
\v 28 Mosheh stripped Aharon of his garments, and put them on Elazar his son; and Aharon died there on the top of the mountain: and Mosheh and Elazar came down from the mountain.
\v 29 When all the congregation saw that Aharon was dead, they wept for Aharon thirty days, even all the house of Yisra'el.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 The Kena'anite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard tell that Yisra'el came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Yisra'el, and took some of them captive.
\v 2 Yisra'el vowed a vow to יהוה, and said, "If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities."
\v 3 יהוה listened to the voice of Yisra'el, and delivered up the Kena'anites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Ḥormah.
\v 4 They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Sea of Reeds, to compass the land of Edom: and the being of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
\v 5 The people spoke against Elohim, and against Mosheh, "Why have you brought us up out of Mitsrayim to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our being loathes this light bread."
\p
\v 6 יהוה sent fiery naḥashim among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Yisra'el died.
\v 7 The people came to Mosheh, and said, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against יהוה, and against you. Pray to יהוה, that He take away the naḥashim from us." Mosheh prayed for the people.
\v 8 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live."
\v 9 Mosheh made a naḥash of copper, and set it on the standard: and it came about, that if a naḥash had bitten any man, when he looked to the naḥash of copper, he lived.
\p
\v 10 The children of Yisra'el traveled, and encamped in Ovoth.
\v 11 They traveled from Ovoth, and encamped at IyeAvarim, in the wilderness which is before Moav, toward the sunrise.
\v 12 From there they traveled, and encamped in the wadi Zered.
\v 13 From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moav, between Moav and the Amorites.
\p
\v 14 Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of יהוה, "Vaheb in Suphah, the wadis of Arnon,
\v 15 the slope of the wadis that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moav."
\p
\v 16 From there they traveled to Beer: that is the well of which יהוה said to Mosheh, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
\p
\v 17 Then sang Yisra'el this song: "Spring up, well; sing to it:
\p
\v 18 the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles." From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;
\p
\v 19 and from Mattanah to Naḥali'el; and from Naḥali'el to Bamoth;
\v 20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moav, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.
\p
\v 21 Yisra'el sent messengers to Siḥon king of the Amorites, saying,
\v 22 "Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border."
\v 23 Siḥon would not allow Yisra'el to pass through his border: but Siḥon gathered all his people together, and went out against Yisra'el into the wilderness, and came to Yahats; and he fought against Yisra'el.
\v 24 Yisra'el struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Yabboq, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
\v 25 Yisra'el took all these cities: and Yisra'el lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Ḥeshbon, and in all its towns.
\v 26 For Ḥeshbon was the city of Siḥon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moav, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.
\p
\v 27 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, "Come to Ḥeshbon. Let the city of Siḥon be built and established;
\p
\v 28 for a fire has gone out of Ḥeshbon, a flame from the city of Siḥon. It has devoured Ar of Moav, the masters of the high places of the Arnon.
\p
\v 29 Woe to you, Moav! You are undone, people of Kemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Siḥon king of the Amorites.
\p
\v 30 We have shot at them. Ḥeshbon has perished even to Divon. We have laid waste even to Nophaḥ, which reaches to Medeva."
\p
\v 31 Thus Yisra'el lived in the land of the Amorites.
\v 32 Mosheh sent to spy out Yazer; and they took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there.
\p
\v 33 They turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
\v 34 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Do not fear him: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Siḥon king of the Amorites, who lived at Ḥeshbon."
\v 35 So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 The children of Yisra'el traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moav beyond the Yarden at Yeriḥo.
\p
\ms פרשת בלק – Parashat Balaq
\v 2 Balaq the son of Tsippor saw all that Yisra'el had done to the Amorites.
\v 3 Moav was very afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moav was distressed because of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 4 Moav said to the elders of Midian, "Now this assembly will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field." Balaq the son of Tsippor was king of Moav at that time.
\v 5 He sent messengers to Bil'am the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, "Behold, there is a people who came out from Mitsrayim. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me.
\v 6 Please come now therefore, curse this people for me; for they are too mighty for me: perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."
\p
\v 7 The elders of Moav and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Bil'am, and spoke to him the words of Balaq.
\v 8 He said to them, "Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as יהוה shall speak to me." The princes of Moav stayed with Bil'am.
\v 9 Elohim came to Bil'am, and said, "Who are these men with you?"
\v 10 Bil'am said to Elohim, "Balaq the son of Tsippor, king of Moav, has sent to me, saying,
\v 11 'Behold, the people that is come out of Mitsrayim, it covers the surface of the earth: now, come curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.'"
\v 12 Elohim said to Bil'am, "You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people; for they are blessed."
\v 13 Bil'am rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balaq, "Go to your land; for יהוה refuses to permit me to go with you."
\v 14 The princes of Moav rose up, and they went to Balaq, and said, "Bil'am refuses to come with us."
\p
\v 15 Balaq sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.
\v 16 They came to Bil'am, and said to him, "Thus says Balaq the son of Tsippor, 'Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me:
\v 17 for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.'"
\v 18 Bil'am answered the servants of Balaq, "If Balaq would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of יהוה my Elohim, to do less or more.
\v 19 Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what יהוה will speak to me more."
\v 20 Elohim came to Bil'am at night, and said to him, "If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do."
\p
\v 21 Bil'am rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moav.
\p
\v 22 The anger of Elohim was kindled because he went; and the messenger of יהוה placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
\v 23 The donkey saw the messenger of יהוה standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Bil'am struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.
\v 24 Then the messenger of יהוה stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
\v 25 The donkey saw the messenger of יהוה, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Bil'am's foot against the wall: and he struck her again.
\v 26 The messenger of יהוה went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
\v 27 The donkey saw the messenger of יהוה, and she lay down under Bil'am: and Bil'am's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
\v 28 יהוה opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Bil'am, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"
\v 29 Bil'am said to the donkey, "Because you have mocked me, if only there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you."
\v 30 The donkey said to Bil'am, "Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to today? Was there ever a time that I was not useful to you?" He said, "No."
\p
\v 31 Then יהוה opened the eyes of Bil'am, and he saw the messenger of יהוה standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he stooped his head low, and bowed his nose to the ground.
\v 32 The messenger of יהוה said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come forth as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me:
\v 33 and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive."
\v 34 Bil'am said to the messenger of יהוה, "I have sinned; for I did not know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again."
\v 35 The messenger of יהוה said to Bil'am, "Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak." So Bil'am went with the princes of Balaq.
\p
\v 36 When Balaq heard that Bil'am had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moav, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.
\v 37 Balaq said to Bil'am, "Did I not earnestly send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?"
\v 38 Bil'am said to Balaq, "Behold, I have come to you: have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that Elohim puts in my mouth, that shall I speak."
\v 39 Bil'am went with Balaq, and they came to Qiryath Huzoth.
\v 40 Balaq slaughtered cattle and sheep, and sent to Bil'am, and to the princes who were with him.
\p
\v 41 It happened in the morning, that Balaq took Bil'am, and brought him up into the high places of Ba'al; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Bil'am said to Balaq, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
\v 2 Balaq did as Bil'am had spoken; and Balaq and Bil'am offered on every altar a bull and a ram.
\v 3 Bil'am said to Balaq, "Stand by your ascension offering, and I will go: perhaps יהוה will come to meet me; and whatever He shows me I will tell you." He went to a bare height.
\p
\v 4 Elohim met Bil'am: and he said to Him, "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar."
\v 5 יהוה put a word in Bil'am's mouth, and said, "Return to Balaq, and thus you shall speak."
\v 6 He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his ascension offering, he, and all the princes of Moav.
\p
\v 7 He took up his parable, and said, "From Aram has Balaq brought me, the king of Moav from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Ya'aqov for me. Come, defy Yisra'el.
\p
\v 8 How shall I curse whom El has not cursed? How shall I defy whom יהוה has not defied?
\p
\v 9 For from the top of the rocks I see him. From the hills I see him. Behold, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
\p
\v 10 Who can count the dust of Ya'aqov, or number the fourth part of Yisra'el? Let me die the death of the righteous! Let my last end be like his!"
\p
\v 11 Balaq said to Bil'am, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether."
\v 12 He answered and said, "Must I not guard to speak that which יהוה puts in my mouth?"
\p
\v 13 Balaq said to him, "Please come with me to another place, where you may see them; you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse them for me from there."
\v 14 He took him into the field of Tsophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
\v 15 He said to Balaq, "Stand here by your ascension offering, while I meet Him yonder."
\v 16 יהוה met Bil'am, and put a word in his mouth, and said, "Return to Balaq, and say this."
\v 17 He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his ascension offering, and the princes of Moav with him. Balaq said to him, "What has יהוה spoken?"
\p
\v 18 He took up his parable, and said, "Rise up, Balaq, and hear! Listen to me, you son of Tsippor.
\p
\v 19 "El is not a man, that He should lie, nor the son of man, that He should relent. Has he said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?
\p
\v 20 "Behold, I have received a command to bless. He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
\p
\v 21 "He has not seen vain exertion in Ya'aqov. Neither has He seen toil in Yisra'el. יהוה his Elohim is with him. The shout of a king is among them.
\p
\v 22 "El brings them out of Mitsrayim. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.
\p
\v 23 "Surely there is no enchantment with Ya'aqov, neither is there any divination with Yisra'el. Now it shall be said of Ya'aqov and of Yisra'el, 'What has El done!'
\p
\v 24 "Behold, the people rise up as a lioness, As a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain."
\p
\v 25 Balaq said to Bil'am, "Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
\v 26 But Bil'am answered Balaq, "Did I not tell you, saying, 'All that יהוה speaks, that I must do'?"
\p
\v 27 Balaq said to Bil'am, "Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please Elohim that you may curse them for me from there."
\v 28 Balaq took Bil'am to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert.
\v 29 Bil'am said to Balaq, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
\v 30 Balaq did as Bil'am had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 When Bil'am saw that it pleased יהוה to bless Yisra'el, he did not go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
\v 2 Bil'am lifted up his eyes, and he saw Yisra'el dwelling according to their tribes; and the Ruaḥ of Elohim came on him.
\p
\v 3 He took up his parable, and said, "Bil'am the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was opened, says;
\p
\v 4 "he says, who hears the speeches of El, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open:
\p
\v 5 "How good are your tents, Ya'aqov, and your Tabernacles, Yisra'el!
\p
\v 6 "As wadis they are spread forth, as gardens by the riverside, as aloes which יהוה has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters.
\p
\v 7 "Water shall flow from his buckets. His seed shall be in many waters. His king shall be higher than Agag. His kingdom shall be exalted.
\p
\v 8 "El brings him out of Mitsrayim. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows.
\p
\v 9 "He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Everyone who blesses you is blessed. Everyone who curses you is cursed."
\p
\v 10 Balaq's anger was kindled against Bil'am, and he struck his hands together; and Balaq said to Bil'am, "I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.
\v 11 Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, יהוה has kept you back from honor."
\v 12 Bil'am said to Balaq, "Did I not also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying,
\v 13 'If Balaq would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of יהוה, to do either good or bad of my own mind. I will say what יהוה says'?
\v 14 Now, behold, I go to my people: come, and I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days."
\p
\v 15 He took up his parable, and said, "Bil'am the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was opened says;
\p
\v 16 "he says, who hears the speeches of El, knows the knowledge of the Most High, and who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:
\p
\v 17 "I see Him, but not now. I see Him, but not near. A Star will come out of Ya'aqov. A scepter will rise out of Yisra'el, and shall strike through the corners of Moav, and break down all the sons of Sheth.
\p
\v 18 "Edom shall be a possession. Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession, while Yisra'el does valiantly.
\p
\v 19 "Out of Ya'aqov shall One have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city."
\p
\v 20 He looked at Amaleq, and took up his parable, and said, "Amaleq was the first of the nations, but his latter end shall come to destruction."
\p
\v 21 He looked at the Qenite, and took up his parable, and said, "Your dwelling place is strong. Your nest is set in the rock.
\p
\v 22 "Nevertheless Qayin shall be wasted, until Ashuwr carries you away captive."
\p
\v 23 He took up his parable, and said, "Alas, who shall live when El does this?
\p
\v 24 "But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim. They shall afflict Ashuwr, and shall afflict Ever. He also shall come to destruction."
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Bil'am rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balaq also went his way.
\p
\v 25 Yisra'el stayed in Shittim; and the people began to whore with the daughters of Moav:
\v 2 for they called the people to the sacrifices of their elohim; and the people ate, and bowed down to their elohim.
\v 3 Yisra'el joined himself to Ba'al Peor: and the anger of יהוה was kindled against Yisra'el.
\v 4 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to יהוה before the sun, that the fierce anger of יהוה may turn away from Yisra'el."
\v 5 Mosheh said to the judges of Yisra'el, "Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Ba'al Peor."
\p
\v 6 Behold, one of the children of Yisra'el came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Mosheh, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 7 When Pineḥas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aharon the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;
\v 8 and he went after the man of Yisra'el into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Yisra'el, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Yisra'el.
\v 9 Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\ms פרשת פינחס – Parashat Pineḥas
\v 10 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 11 "Pineḥas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aharon the priest, has turned My wrath away from the children of Yisra'el, in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the children of Yisra'el in My jealousy.
\v 12 Therefore say, 'Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace:
\v 13 and it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his Elohim, and made atonement for the children of Yisra'el.'"
\p
\v 14 Now the name of the man of Yisra'el that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Shimonites.
\v 15 The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Kozbi, the daughter of Tsur; he was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.
\p
\v 16 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 17 "Harass the Midianites, and strike them;
\v 18 for they harassed you with their wiles, with which they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Kozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor."
\c 26
\p
\v 1 It happened after the plague, that יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Elazar the son of Aharon the priest, saying,
\v 2 "Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all who are able to go forth to war in Yisra'el."
\v 3 Mosheh and Elazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moav by the Yarden at Yeriḥo, saying,
\v 4 "Take a census of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as יהוה commanded Mosheh and the children of Yisra'el." These are those that came out of the land of Mitsrayim.

\v 10 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Qoraḥ, when that company died; what time the fire devoured two hundred fifty men, and they became a sign.

\v 51 These are those who were numbered of the children of Yisra'el, six hundred one thousand seven hundred thirty.
\p
\v 52 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 53 "To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.
\v 54 To the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given.
\v 55 Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.
\v 56 According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer."
\p
\v 57 These are those who were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Qohath, the family of the Qohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites.
\v 58 These are the families of Levi: the family of the Livnites, the family of the Ḥevronites, the family of the Maḥlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Qoraḥites. Qohath brought forth Amram.
\v 59 The name of Amram's wife was Yokeved, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Mitsrayim: and she bore to Amram Aharon and Mosheh, and Miryam their sister.
\v 60 To Aharon were born Nadav and Avihu, Elazar and Ithamar.
\v 61 Nadav and Avihu died, when they offered strange fire before יהוה.
\v 62 Those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a new moon old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Yisra'el, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 63 These are those who were numbered by Mosheh and Elazar the priest, who numbered the children of Yisra'el in the plains of Moav by the Yarden at Yeriḥo.
\v 64 But among these there was not a man of them who were numbered by Mosheh and Aharon the priest, who numbered the children of Yisra'el in the wilderness of Sinai.
\v 65 For יהוה had said of them, 'they shall surely die in the wilderness.' There was not left a man of them, except Kalev the son of Yephunneh, and Yehoshua the son of Nun.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 Then drew near the daughters of Tselophḥad, the son of Ḥepher, the son of Gilad, the son of Makir, the son of Menasheh, of the families of Menasheh the son of Yoseph; and these are the names of his daughters: Maḥlah, Noah, and Ḥoglah, and Milkah, and Tirtsah.
\v 2 They stood before Mosheh, and before Elazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the Tent of Appointment, saying,
\v 3 "Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against יהוה in the company of Qoraḥ: but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.
\v 4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among the brothers of our father."
\v 5 Mosheh brought their judgment before יהוה.
\p
\v 6 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 7 "The daughters of Tselophḥad speak right: you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.
\v 8 You shall speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying, 'If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.
\v 9 If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
\v 10 If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
\v 11 If his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be to the children of Yisra'el a statute and judgment, as יהוה commanded Mosheh.'"
\p
\v 12 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Go up into this mountain of Avarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Yisra'el.
\v 13 When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aharon your brother was gathered;
\v 14 because you rebelled against My word in the wilderness of Tsin, in the strife of the congregation, to treat Me as set-apart at the waters before their eyes." (These are the waters of Merivah of Qadesh in the wilderness of Tsin.)
\p
\v 15 Mosheh spoke to יהוה, saying,
\v 16 "Let יהוה, the Elohim of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
\v 17 who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of יהוה not be as sheep which have no shepherd."
\p
\v 18 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Take Yehoshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Ruaḥ, and lay your hand on him;
\v 19 and set him before Elazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and commission him in their sight.
\v 20 You shall put of your honor on him, that all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el may obey.
\v 21 He shall stand before Elazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before יהוה: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Yisra'el with him, even all the congregation."
\v 22 Mosheh did as יהוה commanded him; and he took Yehoshua, and set him before Elazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
\v 23 and he laid his hands on him, and commissioned him, as יהוה spoke by Mosheh.
\c 28

\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Command the children of Yisra'el, and tell them, 'My offering, My food for My offerings made by fire, for a soothing aroma to Me, you shall guard to offer to Me in their appointed time.'
\v 3 You shall tell them, 'This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to יהוה: male lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual ascension offering.
\v 4 You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other lamb between the evenings;
\v 5 with the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.
\v 6 It is a continual ascension offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a soothing aroma, an offering made by fire to יהוה.
\v 7 Its drink offering shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb. You shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to יהוה in the set-apart place.
\v 8 The other lamb you shall offer between the evenings: as the meal offering of the morning, and as the drink offering of it, you shall offer it, an offering made by fire, for a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\p
\v 9 "'On the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, and the drink offering of it:
\v 10 this is the ascension offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual ascension offering, and the drink offering of it.
\p
\v 11 "'In the beginnings of your new moons you shall offer an ascension offering to יהוה: two young bulls, and one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish;
\v 12 and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram;
\v 13 and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb; for an ascension offering of a soothing aroma, an offering made by fire to יהוה.
\v 14 Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the ascension offering of every new moon, for the new moons throughout the new moons of the year.
\v 15 One male goat for a sin offering to יהוה; it shall be offered besides the continual ascension offering, and the drink offering of it.
\p
\v 16 "'In the first new moon, on the fourteenth day of the new moon, is the Pesaḥ of יהוה.
\v 17 On the fifteenth day of this new moon shall be a Feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
\v 18 On the first day shall be a set-apart rehearsal: you shall do no work of service;
\v 19 but you shall offer an offering made by fire, an ascension offering to יהוה: two young bulls, and one ram, and seven male lambs a year old; they shall be to you without blemish;
\v 20 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil: you shall offer three tenth parts for a bull, and two tenth parts for the ram.
\v 21 You shall offer a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;
\v 22 and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
\v 23 You shall offer these besides the ascension offering of the morning, which is for a continual ascension offering.
\v 24 In this way you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, for a soothing aroma to יהוה: it shall be offered besides the continual ascension offering, and the drink offering of it.
\v 25 On the seventh day you shall have a set-apart rehearsal: you shall do no work of service.
\p
\v 26 "'Also in the day of the first fruits, when you offer a new meal offering to יהוה in your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a set-apart rehearsal; you shall do no work of service;
\v 27 but you shall offer an ascension offering for a soothing aroma to יהוה: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;
\v 28 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth parts for each bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,
\v 29 a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;

\v 40 Mosheh told the children of Yisra'el according to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\c 30
פרשת מטות – Parashat Matot
\p
\v 1 Mosheh spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Yisra'el, saying, "This is the thing which יהוה has commanded.
\v 2 When a man vows a vow to יהוה, or swears an oath to bind his being with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
\p
\v 3 "Also when a woman vows a vow to יהוה, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth,
\v 4 and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her being, and her father holds his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her being shall stand.
\v 5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her being, shall stand: and יהוה will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
\p
\v 6 "If she is married to a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her being,
\v 7 and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she has bound her being shall stand.
\v 8 But if her husband disallow her in the day that he hears it, then he shall make void her vow which is on her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her being: and יהוה will forgive her.
\p
\v 9 "But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, even everything with which she has bound her being, shall stand against her.
\v 10 If she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her being by a bond with an oath,
\v 11 and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and did not disallow her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her being shall stand.
\v 12 But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her being, shall not stand: her husband has made them void; and יהוה will forgive her.
\v 13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the being, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
\v 14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her: he has established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
\v 15 But if he shall make them null and void after he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity."
\v 16 These are the statutes, which יהוה commanded Mosheh, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Avenge the children of Yisra'el for the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
\v 3 Mosheh spoke to the people, saying, "Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute the vengeance of יהוה on Midian.
\v 4 Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Yisra'el, you shall send to the war."
\v 5 So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Yisra'el, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
\v 6 Mosheh sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Pineḥas the son of Elazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the set-apart place and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
\v 7 They warred against Midian, as יהוה commanded Mosheh; and they killed every male.
\v 8 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Reqem, and Tsur, and Ḥur, and Reva, the five kings of Midian: Bil'am also the son of Beor they killed with the sword.
\v 9 The children of Yisra'el took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their livestock, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they plundered.
\v 10 All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.
\v 11 They took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of animal.
\v 12 They brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Mosheh, and to Elazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, to the camp at the plains of Moav, which are by the Yarden at Yeriḥo.
\p
\v 13 Mosheh, and Elazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside of the camp.
\v 14 Mosheh was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.
\v 15 Mosheh said to them, "Have you saved all the women alive?
\v 16 Behold, these caused the children of Yisra'el, through the counsel of Bil'am, to commit trespass against יהוה in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of יהוה.
\v 17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.
\v 18 But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
\v 19 Encamp outside of the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives.
\v 20 As to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood, you shall purify yourselves."
\p
\v 21 Elazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, "This is the statute of the Torah which יהוה has commanded Mosheh:
\v 22 however the gold, and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\v 23 everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that does not withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water.
\v 24 You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp."
\p
\v 25 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 26 "Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Elazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the congregation;
\v 27 and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.
\v 28 Levy a tribute to יהוה of the men of war who went out to battle: one being of five hundred, of the persons, and of the cattle, and of the donkeys, and of the flocks:
\v 29 take it of their half, and give it to Elazar the priest, for the wave offering of יהוה.
\v 30 Of the children of Yisra'el's half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, even of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who guard the charge of the Tabernacle of יהוה."
\v 31 Mosheh and Elazar the priest did as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 32 Now the prey, over and above the plunder which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
\v 33 and seventy-two thousand head of cattle,
\v 34 and sixty-one thousand donkeys,
\v 35 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him.
\v 36 The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep:
\v 37 and the tribute to יהוה of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five.
\v 38 The cattle were thirty-six thousand; of which seventy-two were tribute to יהוה.
\v 39 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which sixty-one were tribute to יהוה.
\v 40 The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom thirty-two persons were tribute to יהוה.
\v 41 Mosheh gave the tribute, which was a wave offering of יהוה, to Elazar the priest, as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 42 Of the children of Yisra'el's half, which Mosheh divided off from the men who warred
\v 43 (now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,
\v 44 and thirty-six thousand head of cattle,
\v 45 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
\v 46 and sixteen thousand persons),
\v 47 even of the children of Yisra'el's half, Mosheh took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who guarded the charge of the Tabernacle of יהוה, as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 48 The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Mosheh;
\v 49 and they said to Mosheh, "Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command, and there lacks not one man of us.
\v 50 We have brought the offering of יהוה, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our beings before יהוה."
\v 51 Mosheh and Elazar the priest took the gold of them, even all worked jewels.
\v 52 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to יהוה, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty sheqels.
\v 53 (For the men of war had taken plunder, every man for himself.)
\v 54 Mosheh and Elazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Appointment, for a memorial for the children of Yisra'el before יהוה.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 Now the children of Reuven and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock: and when they saw the land of Yazer, and the land of Gilad, that behold, the place was a place for livestock;
\v 2 the children of Gad and the children of Reuven came and spoke to Mosheh, and to Elazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
\v 3 "Ataroth, and Divon, and Yazer, and Nimrah, and Ḥeshbon, and Elealeh, and Sevam, and Nevo, and Beon,
\v 4 the land which יהוה struck before the congregation of Yisra'el, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock."
\v 5 They said, "If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; do not bring us over the Yarden."
\p
\v 6 Mosheh said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuven, "Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall you sit here?
\v 7 Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Yisra'el from going over into the land which יהוה has given them?
\v 8 Your fathers did so when I sent them from Qadesh Barnea to see the land.
\v 9 For when they went up to the wadi Eshkol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Yisra'el, that they should not go into the land which יהוה had given them.
\v 10 The anger of יהוה was kindled in that day, and He swore, saying,
\v 11 'Surely none of the men who came up out of Mitsrayim, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Avraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya'aqov; because they have not wholly followed me:
\v 12 except Kalev the son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite, and Yehoshua the son of Nun; because they have followed יהוה completely.'
\v 13 The anger of יהוה was kindled against Yisra'el, and He made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight of יהוה, was consumed.
\p
\v 14 "Behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of יהוה toward Yisra'el.
\v 15 For if you turn away from after Him, He will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people."
\p
\v 16 They came near to him, and said, "We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones:
\v 17 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Yisra'el, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
\v 18 We will not return to our houses, until the children of Yisra'el have inherited every man his inheritance.
\v 19 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Yarden, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Yarden eastward."
\p
\v 20 Mosheh said to them, "If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before יהוה to the war,
\v 21 and every armed man of you will pass over the Yarden before יהוה, until He has driven out His enemies from before Him,
\v 22 and the land is subdued before יהוה; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards יהוה, and towards Yisra'el; and this land shall be to you for a possession before יהוה.
\v 23 But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against יהוה; and be sure your sin will find you out.
\v 24 Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth."
\p
\v 25 The children of Gad and the children of Reuven spoke to Mosheh, saying, "Your servants will do as my master commands.
\v 26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilad;
\v 27 but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before יהוה to battle, as my master says."
\p
\v 28 So Mosheh commanded concerning them to Elazar the priest, and to Yehoshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 29 Mosheh said to them, "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuven will pass with you over the Yarden, every man who is armed to battle, before יהוה, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilad for a possession:
\v 30 but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Kena'an."
\v 31 The children of Gad and the children of Reuven answered, saying, "As יהוה has said to your servants, so will we do.
\v 32 We will pass over armed before יהוה into the land of Kena'an, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Yarden."
\p
\v 33 Mosheh gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuven, and to the half-tribe of Menasheh the son of Yoseph, the kingdom of Siḥon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities of it with their borders, even the cities of the surrounding land.
\v 34 The children of Gad built Divon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
\v 35 and Atrothshophan, and Yazer, and Yogbehah,
\v 36 and Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
\v 37 The children of Reuven built Ḥeshbon, and Elealeh, and Qiryathaim,
\v 38 and Nevo, and Ba'al Meon, (their names being changed), and Sivmah: and they gave other names to the cities which they built.
\v 39 The children of Makir the son of Menasheh went to Gilad, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein.
\v 40 Mosheh gave Gilad to Makir the son of Menasheh; and he lived therein.
\v 41 Yair the son of Menasheh went and took its towns, and called them Ḥavvoth Yair.
\v 42 Novaḥ went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Novaḥ, after his own name.

\v 41 They traveled from Mount Hor, and encamped in Tsalmonah.
\v 42 They traveled from Tsalmonah, and encamped in Punon.
\v 43 They traveled from Punon, and encamped in Ovoth.
\v 44 They traveled from Ovoth, and encamped in Iye Avarim, in the border of Moav.
\v 45 They traveled from Iyim, and encamped in Divon Gad.
\v 46 They traveled from Divon Gad, and encamped in Almon Divlathayim.
\v 47 They traveled from Almon Divlathayim, and encamped in the mountains of Avarim, before Nevo.
\v 48 They traveled from the mountains of Avarim, and encamped in the plains of Moav by the Yarden at Yeriḥo.
\v 49 They encamped by the Yarden, from Beth Yeshimoth even to Havel Shittim in the plains of Moav.
\p
\v 50 יהוה spoke to Mosheh in the plains of Moav by the Yarden at Yeriḥo, saying,
\v 51 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them, 'When you pass over the Yarden into the land of Kena'an,
\v 52 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:
\v 53 and you shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for I have given the land to you to possess it.
\v 54 You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
\v 55 But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain of them will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the land in which you dwell.
\v 56 It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so will I do to you.'"
\c 34
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Command the children of Yisra'el, and tell them, 'When you come into the land of Kena'an (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Kena'an according to its borders),
\v 3 then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Tsin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;
\v 4 and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Aqrabbim, and pass along to Tsin; and the goings out of it shall be southward of Qadesh Barnea; and it shall go forth to Ḥatsar Addar, and pass along to Atsmon;
\v 5 and the border shall turn about from Atsmon to the wadi of Mitsrayim, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.
\v 6 For the western border, you shall have the great sea and the border of it: this shall be your west border.
\p
\v 7 "'This shall be your north border: from the great sea you shall mark out for you Mount Hor;
\v 8 from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Ḥamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Tsedad;
\v 9 and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Ḥatsar Enan: this shall be your north border.
\v 10 You shall mark out your east border from Ḥatsar Enan to Shepham;
\v 11 and the border shall go down from Shepham to Rivlah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Kinnereth eastward;
\v 12 and the border shall go down to the Yarden, and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders around it.'"
\p
\v 13 Mosheh commanded the children of Yisra'el, saying, "This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which יהוה has commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;
\v 14 for the tribe of the children of Reuven according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Menasheh have received, their inheritance:
\v 15 the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Yarden at Yeriḥo eastward, toward the sunrise."
\p
\v 16 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 17 "These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Elazar the priest, and Yehoshua the son of Nun.
\v 18 You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.
\v 19 These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Yehudah, Kalev the son of Yephunneh.
\v 20 Of the tribe of the children of Shimon, Shemu'el the son of Ammihud.
\v 21 Of the tribe of Benyamin, Elidad the son of Kislon.
\v 22 Of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Buqi the son of Yogli.
\v 23 Of the children of Yoseph: of the tribe of the children of Menasheh a prince, Ḥanni'el the son of Ephod.
\v 24 Of the tribe of the children of Ephrayim a prince, Qemu'el the son of Shiphtan.
\v 25 Of the tribe of the children of Zevulun a prince, Elitsaphan the son of Parnak.
\v 26 Of the tribe of the children of Yissakhar a prince, Palti'el the son of Azzan.
\v 27 Of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Aḥihud the son of Shelomi.
\v 28 Of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedah'el the son of Ammihud."
\v 29 These are they whom יהוה commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Yisra'el in the land of Kena'an.

\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh in the plains of Moav by the Yarden at Yeriḥo, saying,
\v 2 "Command the children of Yisra'el that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites.
\v 3 The cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock, and for their substance, and for all their animals.
\v 4 The suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it.
\v 5 You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
\v 6 The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to: and besides them you shall give forty-two cities.
\v 7 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities together with their suburbs.
\v 8 Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession of the children of Yisra'el, from the many you shall take many; and from the few you shall take few: everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his cities to the Levites."
\p
\v 9 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 10 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them, 'When you pass over the Yarden into the land of Kena'an,
\v 11 then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally may flee there.
\v 12 The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer not die, until he stands before the congregation for judgment.
\v 13 The cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.
\v 14 You shall give three cities beyond the Yarden, and you shall give three cities in the land of Kena'an; they shall be cities of refuge.
\v 15 For the children of Yisra'el, and for the sojourner and for the guest living among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unintentionally may flee there.
\p
\v 16 "'But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\v 17 If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\v 18 Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\v 19 The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he shall put him to death.
\p
\v 20 "'If he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,
\v 21 or in hostility struck him with his hand, so that he died; he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.
\p
\v 22 "'But if he thrust him suddenly without hostility, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait,
\v 23 or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;
\v 24 then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these judgments;
\v 25 and the congregation shall deliver the murderer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the set-apart oil.
\p
\v 26 "'But if the murderer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees,
\v 27 and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,
\v 28 because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
\v 29 These things shall be for a statute and judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\v 30 Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.
\v 31 Moreover you shall take no ransom for the being of a murderer who is wicked of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
\v 32 You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
\v 33 So you shall not pollute the land in which you are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him who shed it.
\v 34 You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, יהוה, dwell in the midst of the children of Yisra'el.'"
\p
\v 36 The heads of the fathers' houses of the family of the children of Gilad, the son of Makir, the son of Menasheh, of the families of the sons of Yoseph, came near, and spoke before Mosheh, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' houses of the children of Yisra'el:
\v 2 and they said, "יהוה commanded my master to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Yisra'el: and my master was commanded by יהוה to give the inheritance of Tselophḥad our brother to his daughters.
\v 3 If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Yisra'el, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
\v 4 When the yovel of the children of Yisra'el shall be, then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
\p
\v 5 Mosheh commanded the children of Yisra'el according to the word of יהוה, saying, "The tribe of the sons of Yoseph speaks right.
\v 6 This is the thing which יהוה does command concerning the daughters of Tselophḥad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married.
\v 7 So shall no inheritance of the children of Yisra'el remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Yisra'el shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
\v 8 Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Yisra'el shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Yisra'el may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.
\v 9 So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Yisra'el shall each keep his own inheritance."
\p
\v 10 The daughters of Tselophḥad did as יהוה commanded Mosheh:
\v 11 for Maḥlah, Tirtsah, and Ḥoglah, and Milkah, and Noah, the daughters of Tselophḥad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.
\v 12 They were married into the families of the sons of Menasheh the son of Yoseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
\v 13 These are the commands and the judgments which יהוה commanded by Mosheh to the children of Yisra'el in the plains of Moav by the Yarden at Yeriḥo.
