\c 1
\p
\q1
\v 1 Blessed is the man
\q2 who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
\q1 nor stand in the way of sinners, 
\q2 nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
\q1
\v 2 but his delight is in the Torah of יהוה.
\q2 On His Torah he meditates day and night.
\b
\q1
\v 3 He will be like a tree
\q2 planted by the streams of water,
\q1 that produces its fruit in its season,
\q2 whose leaf also does not wither.
\q2 Whatever he does shall prosper.
\q1
\v 4 The wicked are not so,
\q2 but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment,
\q2 nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
\q1
\v 6 For יהוה knows the way of the righteous,
\q2 but the way of the wicked shall perish.
\c 2
\p
\q1
\v 1 Why do the nations rage,
\q2 and the peoples plot a vain thing?
\q1
\v 2 The kings of the earth take a stand,
\q2 and the rulers take counsel together,
\q2 against יהוה, and against His Anointed, saying,
\q1
\v 3 "Let us break their bonds apart,
\q2 and cast their cords from us."
\q1
\v 4 He who sits in the heavens will laugh.
\q2 יהוה will have them in derision.
\q1
\v 5 Then He will speak to them in His anger,
\q2 and terrify them in His wrath:
\q1
\v 6 "Yet I have set My King
\q2 on My set-apart hill of Tsion."
\b
\q1
\v 7 I will tell of the decree.
\q2 יהוה said to me, "You are My son.
\q2 Today I have brought you forth.
\q1
\v 8 Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,
\q2 the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
\q1
\v 9 You shall break them with a rod of iron.
\q2 You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
\b
\q1
\v 10 Now therefore be wise, you kings.
\q2 Be disciplined, you judges of the earth.
\q1
\v 11 Serve יהוה with fear,
\q2 and rejoice with trembling.
\q1
\v 12 Give sincere homage to the Son,
\q2 lest He be angry, and you perish on the way,
\q1 for His wrath will soon be kindled.
\q2 Blessed are all those who take refuge in Him.
\c 3
\p
\d A Psalm by David, when he fled from Avshalom his son.
\q1
\v 1 O יהוה, how my adversaries have increased!
\q2 Many are rising up against me.
\q1
\v 2 Many are saying of my being,
\q2 "There is no help for him in Elohim."
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 3 But You, O יהוה, are a shield around me,
\q2 my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
\q1
\v 4 I cry to יהוה with my voice,
\q2 and He answers me out of His set-apart mountain.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 5 I lay down and slept.
\q2 I awoke, for יהוה supports me.
\q1
\v 6 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people
\q2 who have set themselves against me on every side.
\q1
\v 7 Arise, יהוה!
\q2 Save me, my Elohim!
\q1 For You have struck all of my enemies on the cheek.
\q2 You have broken the teeth\f + \fr 3:7 \fk "Broken the teeth" \ft Idiom meaning "made powerless."\f* of the wicked.
\q1
\v 8 Salvation belongs to יהוה.
\q2 Your blessing \add be\add* on Your people.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\c 4
\p
\d For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 Answer me when I call, O Elohim of my righteousness.
\q2 You enlarged\f + \fr 4:1 \ft Idiom meaning "set me free."\f* me \add when I was in\add* distress.
\q1 Be kind to me, and hear my prayer.
\b
\q1
\v 2 You sons of men, how long shall my glory become dishonor?
\q2 Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?
\qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 3 But know that יהוה has set apart for Himself him who is kind:
\q2 יהוה hears when I call to Him.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Stand in awe, and do not sin.
\q2 Search your own heart on your bed, and be still.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 5 Slaughter the sacrifices of righteousness.
\q2 Rely on יהוה.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Many say, "Who will show us any good?"
\q2 יהוה, let the light of Your face shine on us.
\q1
\v 7 You have put gladness in my heart,
\q2 more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.
\b
\q1
\v 8 In peace I will both lie down and sleep,
\q2 for You, יהוה alone, make me dwell securely.
\c 5
\p
\d For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 Give ear to my speeches, יהוה.
\q2 Consider my meditation.
\q1
\v 2 Listen to the voice of my cry,
\q2 my King and my Elohim;
\q1 for to You do I pray.
\q1
\v 3 יהוה, in the morning You shall hear my voice.
\q2 In the morning I will direct \add my requests\add* to You,
\q1 and will watch expectantly.
\b
\q1
\v 4 For You are not an El that delights in wickedness.
\q2 Evil \add shall\add* not dwell with You.
\q1
\v 5 The arrogant shall not stand before Your eyes.
\q2 You hate all workers of vain exertion.
\q1
\v 6 You will destroy those who speak lies.
\q2 יהוה abhors the bloody and deceitful man.
\b
\q1
\v 7 But as for me, in the abundance of Your loving-loving-kindness
\q2 I will come into Your house.
\q1 I will bow down to Your set-apart Temple
\q2 in fear of You.
\q1
\v 8 Lead me, יהוה, in Your righteousness
\q2 because of my enemies.
\q1 Make Your way straight before my face.
\b
\q1
\v 9 For there is no stability in their mouth.
\q2 Their heart is destruction.
\q1 Their throat is an open tomb.\f + \fr 5:9 \ft Idiom meaning "to speak deceitfully."\f*
\q2 They flatter with their tongue.
\q1
\v 10 \add Declare\add* them guilty, Elohim.
\q2 Let them fall by their own counsels.
\q1 Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,
\q2 for they have rebelled against You.
\b
\q1
\v 11 But let all those who take refuge in You rejoice.
\q2 Let them always shout for joy,
\q1 because You defend them.
\q2 Let them also who love Your Name be joyful in You.
\q1
\v 12 For You will bless the righteous. יהוה,
\q2 You will surround him with acceptance as with a shield.
\c 6
\p
\d For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 יהוה, do not rebuke me in Your anger,
\q2 neither discipline me in Your wrath.
\q1
\v 2 Be kind to me, יהוה,
\q2 for I am faint. יהוה,
\q2 heal me, for my bones are troubled.
\q1
\v 3 My being is also in great anguish.
\q2 But You, יהוה—how long?
\b
\q1
\v 4 Return, יהוה. Deliver my being,
\q2 and save me for the sake of Your loving-kindness.
\rem Note: Changed "loving-loving-kindness" to "loving-kindness" since it seems like a typo. Correct me if I'm wrong. (Johan Thorén 2018-05-19 15:32 CEST)
\q1
\v 5 For in death there is no memory of You.
\q2 In Sheol, who shall give You thanks?
\b
\q1
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning.
\q2 Every night I make my bed swim.
\q2 I dissolve my couch with my tears.
\q1
\v 7 My eye wastes away because of grief.
\q2 It grows old because of all my adversaries.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Depart from me, all you workers of vain exertion,
\q2 for יהוה has heard the voice of my weeping.
\q1
\v 9 יהוה has heard my petition.
\q2 יהוה receives my prayer.
\q1
\v 10 May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.
\q2 They shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.
\c 7
\p
\d A meditation by David, which he sang to יהוה, concerning the words of Kush, the Benyamite.
\q1
\v 1 יהוה, my Elohim, I take refuge in You.
\q2 Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
\q1
\v 2 lest he tear apart my being like a lion,
\q2 ripping it \add in pieces\add*, with no one to deliver.
\b
\q1
\v 3 יהוה, my Elohim, if I have done this,
\q2 if there is unrighteousness in my hands,
\q1
\v 4 if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me
\q2 (yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),
\q1
\v 5 let the enemy pursue my being, and overtake it;
\q2 yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,
\q2 and lay my glory in the dust.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 6 Arise, יהוה, in Your anger.
\q2 Lift up Yourself against the rage of my adversaries.
\q2 Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.
\q1
\v 7 Let the congregation of the peoples surround You.
\q2 Rule over them on high.
\b
\q1
\v 8 יהוה administers judgment to the peoples.
\q2 Judge me, יהוה, according to my righteousness,
\q2 and to my integrity that is in me.
\q1
\v 9 Oh let the wickedness of the evil come to an end,
\q2 but establish the righteous;
\q1 their hearts and kidneys\f + \fr 7:9 \ft Idioms meaning "thoughts" and "emotions" respectively.\f* are searched
\q2 by the righteous Elohim.
\q1
\v 10 My shield is with Elohim,
\q2 who saves the upright in heart.
\q1
\v 11 Elohim judges the righteous, yes,
\q2 and El has indignation \add with the wicked\add* every day.
\b
\q1
\v 12 If a man does not turn back,
\q2 He will sharpen His sword;
\q2 He has bent and made ready His bow.
\q1
\v 13 He has also prepared for Himself the instruments of death.
\q2 He makes ready His flaming arrows.
\q1
\v 14 Behold, he travails with vain exertion.
\q2 Yes, he has conceived toil,
\q2 and brought out falsehood.
\q1
\v 15 He has dug a hole,
\q2 and has fallen into the pit which he made.
\q1
\v 16 His toil shall return to his own head.
\q2 His violence shall come down
\q2 on the crown of his own head.
\b
\q1
\v 17 I will give thanks to יהוה according to His righteousness,
\q2 and will sing praise to the Name of יהוה Elyon.
\c 8
\p
\d For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 יהוה, our Master,
\q2 how majestic is Your Name in all the earth,
\q2 who has set Your glory above the heavens!
\q1
\v 2 From the lips of babes and infants
\q2 You have established strength,
\q1 because of Your adversaries,
\q2 that You might cause the enemy and the avenger to cease.
\b
\q1
\v 3 When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,
\q2 the moon and the stars, which You have ordained;
\q1
\v 4 what is man, that You think of him?
\q2 What is the son of man, that You care for him?
\b
\q1
\v 5 For You have made him a little lower than Elohim,\f + \fr 8:5 \ft Heb. MT contains the word אלהים (elohim) as it is here. Notice this is not the word מלאך (malak) which means "messenger." LXX uses the word αγγελος (angelos) which does mean "messenger." Syr. agrees with the Septuagint, rendering it ܡܠܐܟܐ (malaka), meaning "messenger." Lat. agrees with the Masoretic, rendering it with the Latin word Deo, the equivalent to the singular form El. See also Ivrim 2:7.\f*
\q2 and crowned him with glory and honor.
\q1
\v 6 You make him ruler over the works of Your hands.
\q2 You have put all things under his feet:
\q1
\v 7 All sheep and cattle, yes,
\q2 and the animals of the field,
\q1
\v 8 The birds of the heavens,
\q2 the fish of the sea,
\q2 and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
\b
\q1
\v 9 יהוה, our Master,
\q2 how majestic is Your Name in all the earth!
\c 9
\p
\d For the Chief Musician. Set to "The Death of the Son." A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 I will give thanks to יהוה with my whole heart.
\q2 I will tell of all Your marvelous works.
\q1
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in You.
\q2 I will sing praise to Your Name, O Elyon.
\b
\q1
\v 3 When my enemies turn back,
\q2 they stumble and perish in Your presence.
\q1
\v 4 For You have maintained my just judgment.
\q2 You sit on the throne judging righteously.
\b
\q1
\v 5 You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked.
\q2 You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
\q1
\v 6 The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.
\q2 The very memory of the cities which You have overthrown has perished.
\b
\q1
\v 7 But יהוה reigns forever.
\q2 He has prepared His throne for judgment.
\q1
\v 8 He will judge the world in righteousness.
\q2 He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
\b
\q1
\v 9 יהוה will also be a high tower for the oppressed;
\q2 a high tower in times of trouble.
\q1
\v 10 Those who know Your Name will rely on You,
\q2 for You, יהוה, have not forsaken those who seek You.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Sing praises to יהוה, who dwells in Tsion,
\q2 and declare among the people what He has done.
\q1
\v 12 For He who avenges blood remembers them.
\q2 He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Be kind to me, יהוה.
\q2 See my affliction by those who hate me,
\q2 and lift me up from the gates of death;
\q1
\v 14 that I may show all of Your praise.
\q2 In the gates of the daughter of Tsion,
\q2 I will rejoice in Your salvation.
\b
\q1
\v 15 The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made.
\q2 In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.
\q1
\v 16 יהוה has made Himself known. He has executed judgment.
\q2 The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands.
\qs Meditation. Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 17 The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol.
\q2 Even all the nations that forget Elohim.
\b
\q1
\v 18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten,
\q2 nor the hope of the poor perish forever.
\b
\q1
\v 19 Arise, יהוה! Do not let man prevail.
\q2 Let the nations be judged in Your eyes.
\q1
\v 20 Put them in fear, יהוה.
\q2 Let the nations know that they are only men.
\c 10
\p
\q1
\v 1 Why do You stand far off, יהוה?
\q2 Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?
\b
\q1
\v 2 In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.
\q2 They are caught in the schemes that they devise.
\q1
\v 3 For the wicked boasts of his being's desires.
\q2 He blesses the greedy, and condemns יהוה.
\q1
\v 4 The wicked, in the pride of his face,
\q2 has no room in his thoughts for Elohim.
\q1
\v 5 His ways are prosperous at all times.
\q2 He is haughty, and Your judgments are far from his sight.
\q2 As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.
\q1
\v 6 He says in his heart, "I shall not be shaken.
\q2 For generations I shall have no trouble."
\q1
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.
\q2 Under his tongue is toil and vain exertion.
\q1
\v 8 He lies in wait near the villages.
\q2 From ambushes, he murders the innocent.
\q2 His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.
\q1
\v 9 He lurks in secret as a lion in his den.
\q2 He lies in wait to catch the helpless.
\q2 He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his net.
\q1
\v 10 The helpless are crushed.
\q2 They collapse.
\q2 They fall under his strength.
\q1
\v 11 He says in his heart, "El has forgotten.
\q2 He hides His face. He will never see it."
\b
\q1
\v 12 Arise, יהוה! El, lift up Your hand!
\q2 Do not forget the helpless.
\q1
\v 13 Why does the wicked person condemn Elohim,
\q2 and say in his heart, "Elohim will not call me into account?"
\q1
\v 14 But You do see toil and grief.
\q2 You consider it to take it into Your hand.
\q2 You help the victim and the fatherless.
\q1
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked.
\q2 As for the evil man,
\q2 seek out his wickedness until You find none.
\b
\q1
\v 16 יהוה is King forever and ever!
\q2 The nations will perish out of His land.
\q1
\v 17 יהוה, You have heard the desire of the humble.
\q2 You will prepare their heart.
\q2 You will cause Your ear to hear,
\q1
\v 18 to judge the fatherless and the oppressed;
\q2 that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more.
\c 11
\p
\d For the Chief Musician. By David.
\q1
\v 1 In יהוה, I take refuge.
\q2 How can you say to my being,
\q2 "Flee as a bird to your mountain!"
\q1
\v 2 For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.
\q2 They set their arrows on the strings,
\q1 that they may shoot in darkness
\q2 at the upright in heart.
\q1
\v 3 If the foundations are destroyed,
\q2 what can the righteous do?
\b
\q1
\v 4 יהוה is in His set-apart Temple.
\q2 יהוה is on His throne in heavens.
\q1 His eyes observe.
\q2 His eyes examine the children of men.
\q1
\v 5 יהוה examines the righteous,
\q2 but the wicked and him who loves violence
\q2 His being hates.
\q1
\v 6 On the wicked He will rain blazing coals;
\q2 fire, sulfur, and scorching wind
\q2 shall be the portion of their cup.
\q1
\v 7 For יהוה is righteous.
\q2 He loves righteousness.
\q2 The upright shall see His face.
\c 12
\p
\d For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of David.
\q1
\v 1 Help, יהוה; for the kind one ceases.
\q2 For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
\q1
\v 2 Everyone lies to his neighbor.
\q2 They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.
\b
\q1
\v 3 May יהוה cut off all flattering lips,
\q2 and the tongue that boasts,
\q1
\v 4 who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail.
\q2 Our lips are our own. Who is master over us?"
\b
\q1
\v 5 "Because of the oppression of the weak
\q2 and because of the groaning of the needy,
\q1 I will now arise," says יהוה;
\q2 "I will set him in safety from those who malign him."
\q1
\v 6 The speeches of יהוה are flawless speeches,
\q2 as silver refined in a clay furnace,
\q2 purified seven times.
\b
\q1
\v 7 You will guard them, יהוה.
\q2 You will preserve them from this generation forever.
\q1
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side,
\q2 when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
\c 13
\p
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 How long, יהוה? Will You forget me forever?
\q2 How long will You hide Your face from me?
\q1
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my being,
\q2 having sorrow in my heart every day?
\q2 How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
\b
\q1
\v 3 Behold, and answer me,
\q2 יהוה, my Elohim.
\q1 Give light to my eyes,
\q2 lest I sleep in death;
\q1
\v 4 Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him;"
\q2 Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.
\b
\q1
\v 5 But I rely on Your loving-kindness.
\q2 My heart rejoices in Your salvation.
\q1
\v 6 I will sing to יהוה,
\q2 because He has been good to me.
\c 14
\p
\d For the Chief Musician. By David.
\q1
\v 1 The fool has said in his heart,
\q2 "There is no Elohim."
\q1 They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds.
\q2 There is no one who does good.
\b
\q1
\v 2 יהוה looked down from heavens on the children of men,
\q2 to see if there were any who understood,
\q2 who sought after Elohim.
\b
\q1
\v 3 They have all gone aside.
\q2 They have together become corrupt.
\q1 There is no one who does good,
\q2 no, not one.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Have all the workers of vain exertion no knowledge,
\q2 who eat up my people as they eat bread,
\q2 and do not call on יהוה?
\b
\q1
\v 5 There they were in great fear,
\q2 for Elohim is in the generation of the righteous.
\q1
\v 6 You frustrate the plan of the poor,
\q2 because יהוה is his refuge.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Oh that the salvation of Yisra'el would come out of Tsion!
\q2 When יהוה restores the fortunes of His people,
\q2 then Ya'aqov shall rejoice, and Yisra'el shall be glad.
\c 15
\p
\d A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 יהוה, who shall dwell in Your set-apart place?
\q2 Who shall live on Your set-apart hill?
\b
\q1
\v 2 He who walks blamelessly does what is right,
\q2 and speaks truth in his heart;
\q1
\v 3 He who does not slander with his tongue,
\q2 nor does evil to his friend,
\q2 nor casts slurs against his fellow man;
\q1
\v 4 In whose eyes a vile man is despised,
\q2 but who honors those who fear יהוה;
\q1 he who keeps an oath even when it hurts,
\q2 and does not change;
\q1
\v 5 he who does not lend out his money for usury,
\q2 nor take a bribe against the innocent.
\b
\q1 He who does these things shall never be shaken.
\c 16
\p
\d A Poem by David.
\q1
\v 1 Guard me, O El,
\q2 for in You do I take refuge.
\q1
\v 2 My being, you have said to יהוה,
\q2 "You are Adonai.
\q2 Apart from You I have no good thing."
\b
\q1
\v 3 As for the set-apart ones who are in the earth,
\q2 they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Their wounds shall be multiplied
\q2 who give gifts to another el.
\q1 Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,
\q2 nor take their names on my lips.
\b
\q1
\v 5 יהוה assigned my portion and my cup.
\q2 You made my lot secure.
\q1
\v 6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.
\q2 Yes, I have a good inheritance.
\b
\q1
\v 7 I will bless יהוה, who has given me counsel.
\q2 Yes, my kidneys discipline me in the night seasons.
\q1
\v 8 I have set יהוה always before me.
\q2 Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.
\q2 My body shall also dwell securely.
\q1
\v 10 For You will not leave my being in Sheol,
\q2 neither will You allow Your Kind One to see corruption.
\b
\q1
\v 11 You will show me the path of life.
\q2 In Your presence is fullness of joy.
\q2 In Your right hand there are pleasures forever more.
\c 17
\p
\d A Prayer by David.
\q1
\v 1 Hear, יהוה, my righteous plea;
\q2 Give ear to my prayer,
\q2 that does not go out of deceitful lips.
\q1
\v 2 Let my judgment come out of Your presence.
\q2 Let Your eyes look on uprightness.
\b
\q1
\v 3 You have proved my heart.
\q2 You have visited me in the night.
\q1 You have tried me, and found nothing.
\q2 I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.
\q1
\v 4 As for the deeds of men, by the word of Your lips,
\q2 I have guarded myself from the ways of the violent.
\q1
\v 5 My steps have held fast to Your paths.
\q2 My feet have not slipped.
\b
\q1
\v 6 I have called on You,
\q2 for You will answer me, El.
\q1 Turn Your ear to me.
\q2 Hear my speech.
\q1
\v 7 Show Your marvelous loving-kindness,
\q2 You who save those who take refuge
\q2 by Your right hand from their enemies.

\q2 of \add the\add* daughter of \add the\add* eye.
\q1 Hide me under the shadow of Your wings,
\q2
\v 9from the wicked who oppress me,
\q2 my deadly enemies, who surround me.
\b
\q1
\v 10 They close up their callous hearts.
\q2 With their mouth they speak proudly.
\q1
\v 11 They have now surrounded us in our steps.
\q2 They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
\q1
\v 12 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,
\q2 as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Arise, יהוה, confront him. Cast him down.
\q2 Deliver my being from the wicked by Your sword;
\q1
\v 14 from men by Your hand, יהוה,
\q2 from men of the world,
\q2 whose portion is in this life.
\q1 You fill the belly of Your cherished ones.
\q2 Your sons have plenty,

\p
\d For the Chief Musician. By David the servant of יהוה, who spoke to יהוה the words of this song in the day that יהוה delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said,
\q1
\v 1 I love You, יהוה, my strength.
\q1
\v 2 יהוה is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;
\q2 my El, my rock, in whom I take refuge;
\q1 my shield, and the horn of my salvation,
\q2 my high tower.
\q1
\v 3 I call on יהוה, who is worthy to be praised;
\q2 and I am saved from my enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 4 The cords of death surrounded me.
\q2 The wadis of Beliyya'al made me afraid.
\q1
\v 5 The cords of Sheol were around me.
\q2 The snares of death came on me.
\b
\q1
\v 6 In my distress I called on יהוה,
\q2 and cried to my Elohim.
\q1 He heard my voice out of His Temple.
\q2 My cry before Him came into His ears.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled.
\q2 The foundations also of the mountains quaked
\q2 and were shaken, because He was angry.
\q1
\v 8 Smoke went out of His nostrils.
\q2 Consuming fire came out of His mouth.
\q2 Coals were kindled by it.
\q1
\v 9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down.
\q2 Thick darkness was under His feet.
\q1
\v 10 He rode on a keruv, and flew.
\q2 Yes, He soared on the wings of the wind.
\q1
\v 11 He made darkness His hiding place,
\q2 His sukkah around Him,
\q2 darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
\q1
\v 12 At the brightness before Him
\q2 His thick clouds passed,
\q2 hailstones and coals of fire.
\b
\q1
\v 13 יהוה also thundered in the heavens.
\q2 Elyon uttered His voice:
\q2 hailstones and coals of fire.
\q1
\v 14 He sent out His arrows, and scattered them;
\q2 Yes, great lightning bolts, and routed them.
\q1
\v 15 Then the channels of waters appeared.
\q2 The foundations of the world were laid bare
\q1 at Your rebuke, יהוה,
\q2 at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
\b
\q1
\v 16 He sent from on high. He took me.
\q2 He drew me out of many waters.
\q1
\v 17 He delivered me from my strong enemy,
\q2 from those who hated me;
\q2 for they were too mighty for me.
\q1
\v 18 They came on me in the day of my calamity,
\q2 but יהוה was my support.
\q1
\v 19 He brought me out also into a large place.
\q2 He delivered me, because He delighted in me.
\b
\q1
\v 20 יהוה has rewarded me according to my righteousness.
\q2 According to the cleanness of my hands has He recompensed me.
\q1
\v 21 For I have guarded the ways of יהוה,
\q2 and have not wickedly departed from my Elohim.
\q1
\v 22 For all His judgments were before me.
\q2 I did not put away His statutes from me.
\q1
\v 23 I was also blameless with Him.
\q2 I guarded myself from my iniquity.
\q1
\v 24 Therefore יהוה has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
\q2 according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyesight.
\b
\q1
\v 25 With the kind You will show Yourself kind.
\q2 With the perfect man, You will show Yourself perfect.
\q1
\v 26 With the pure, You will show Yourself pure.
\q2 With the perverse You will show Yourself astute.
\q1
\v 27 For You will save the afflicted people,
\q2 but the haughty eyes You will bring down.
\q1
\v 28 For You will light my lamp, יהוה.
\q2 My Elohim will light up my darkness.
\q1
\v 29 For by You, I advance through a troop.
\q2 By my Elohim, I leap over a wall.
\q1
\v 30 As for El, His way is perfect.
\q2 The speeches of יהוה are tried.
\q2 He is a shield to all those who take refuge in Him.
\b
\q1
\v 31 For who is Eloah, except יהוה?
\q2 Who is a rock, besides our Elohim,
\q1
\v 32 the El who arms me with strength,
\q2 and makes my way perfect?
\q1
\v 33 He makes my feet like deer's feet,
\q2 and sets me on my high places.
\q1
\v 34 He teaches my hands to war,
\q2 so that my arms bend a bow of copper.
\q1
\v 35 You have also given me the shield of Your salvation.
\q2 Your right hand sustains me.
\q2 Your gentleness has made me great.
\q1
\v 36 You have enlarged my steps under me,
\q2 my feet have not slipped.
\q1
\v 37 I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.
\q2 Neither will I turn again until they are consumed.
\q1
\v 38 I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.
\q2 They shall fall under my feet.
\q1
\v 39 For You have armed me with strength to the battle.
\q2 You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
\q1
\v 40 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,
\q2 that I might cut off those who hate me.
\q1
\v 41 They cried, but there was no one to save;
\q2 even to יהוה, but He did not answer them.
\q1
\v 42 Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.
\q2 I cast them out as the mire of the streets.
\b
\q1
\v 43 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.
\q2 You have made me the head of the nations.
\q2 A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
\q1
\v 44 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.
\q2 The sons of foreigners shall submit themselves to me.
\q1
\v 45 The sons of foreigners shall fade away,
\q2 and shall come trembling out of their close places.
\b
\q1
\v 46 יהוה lives; and blessed be my rock.
\q2 Exalted be the Elohim of my salvation,
\q1
\v 47 even the El who executes vengeance for me,
\q2 and subdues peoples under me.
\q1
\v 48 He rescues me from my enemies.
\q2 Yes, You lift me up above those who rise up against me.
\q2 You deliver me from the violent man.
\b
\q1
\v 49 Therefore I will give thanks to You, יהוה, among the nations,
\q2 and will sing praises to Your Name.
\q1
\v 50 He gives great deliverance to His king,
\q2 and shows loving-kindness to His anointed,
\q2 to David and to his seed, forever more.

\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 The heavens declare the glory of El.
\q2 The expanse shows His handiwork.
\q1
\v 2 Day after day they pour out speech,
\q2 and night after night they display knowledge.
\q1
\v 3 There is no speech nor language,
\q2 where their voice is not heard.
\q1
\v 4 Their voice has gone out through all the earth,
\q2 their sayings to the end of the world.
\q1 In them He has set a tent for the sun,
\q2
\v 5 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room,
\q2 like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.
\q1
\v 6 His going out is from the end of the heavens,
\q2 his circuit to its ends;
\q2 there is nothing hidden from its heat.
\b
\q1
\v 7 The Torah of יהוה is perfect,

\q1 The witness of יהוה is faithful,

\q1
\v 8 The precepts of יהוה are right,
\q2 rejoicing the heart.
\q1 The command of יהוה is pure,
\q2 enlightening the eyes.
\q1
\v 9 The fear of יהוה is clean,
\q2 enduring forever.
\q1 The judgments of יהוה are true,
\q2 and righteous altogether.
\q1
\v 10 More to be desired are they than gold,
\q2 yes, than much fine gold;
\q1 sweeter also than honey
\q2 and the extract of the honeycomb.
\q1
\v 11 Moreover by them is Your servant warned.
\q2 In guarding them there is great reward.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Who can discern his errors?
\q2 Acquit me of hidden \add ones\add*.
\q1
\v 13 Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins.
\q2 Let them not have dominion over me.
\q1 Then I will be upright.
\q2 I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.
\q1
\v 14 Let the speeches of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
\q2 be acceptable in Your eyes,
\q2 יהוה, my rock, and my redeemer.

\v 2 send you help from the set-apart place,
\q2 sustain you from Tsion,
\q1
\v 3 remember all your offerings,
\q2 and accept your ascension offering.

\q2 In the Name of our Elohim,
\q2 we will set up our banners.
\q1 May יהוה grant all your requests.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Now I know that יהוה saves His anointed.
\q2 He will answer him from His set-apart heavens,
\q2 with the saving strength of His right hand.

\v 7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses,
\q2 but we trust the Name of יהוה our Elohim.

\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 The king rejoices in Your strength, יהוה!
\q2 How greatly he rejoices in Your salvation!
\q1
\v 2 You have given him his heart's desire,
\q2 and have not withheld the request of his lips.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 3 For You meet him with the blessings of goodness.
\q2 You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
\q1
\v 4 He asked life of You, You gave it to him,
\q2 even length of days forever and ever.
\q1
\v 5 His glory is great in Your salvation.
\q2 You lay honor and majesty on him.
\q1
\v 6 For You make him most blessed forever.
\q2 You make him glad with joy in Your presence.
\q1
\v 7 For the king relies on יהוה.
\q2 Through the loving-kindness of Elyon,
\q2 he shall not be moved.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Your hand will find out all of Your enemies.
\q2 Your right hand will find out those who hate You.
\q1
\v 9 You will make them as a fiery furnace
\q2 in the time of Your anger.
\q1 יהוה will swallow them up in His wrath.
\q2 The fire shall devour them.
\q1
\v 10 You will destroy their seed from the earth,
\q2 their posterity from among the children of men.
\q1
\v 11 For they intended evil against You.
\q2 They plotted evil against You which cannot succeed.
\q1
\v 12 For You will make them turn their back,
\q2 when You aim drawn bows at their face.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Be exalted, יהוה, in Your strength,
\q2 so we will sing and praise Your power.

\d For the Chief Musician; set to "The Doe of the Morning." A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 My El, my El, why have You forsaken me?
\q2 Why are You so far from helping me,
\q2 and from the words of my groaning?
\q1
\v 2 My Elohim, I cry in the daytime,
\q2 but You do not answer;
\q2 in the night season, and am not silent.
\b
\q1
\v 3 But You are set-apart,
\q2 You who inhabit the praises of Yisra'el.
\q1
\v 4 Our fathers relied on You.
\q2 They relied, and You delivered them.
\q1
\v 5 They cried to You, and were delivered.
\q2 They relied on You, and were not disappointed.
\b
\q1
\v 6 But I am a worm, and no man;
\q2 a reproach of men, and despised by the people.
\q1
\v 7 All those who see me mock me.
\q2 They insult me with their lips.
\q2 They shake their heads, saying,
\q1
\v 8 "He trusts in יהוה. Let Him deliver him.
\q2 Let Him rescue him, since He delights in him."
\b
\q1
\v 9 But You brought me out of the womb.
\q2 You made me rely while at my mother's breasts.
\q1
\v 10 I was thrown on You from my mother's womb.
\q2 You are my El since my mother bore me.
\q1
\v 11 Do not be far from me,
\q2 for trouble is near.
\q2 For there is no one to help.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Many bulls have surrounded me.
\q2 Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.
\q1
\v 13 They open their mouths wide against me,
\q2 lions tearing prey and roaring.
\b
\q1
\v 14 I am poured out like water.
\q2 All my bones are out of joint.
\q1 My heart is like wax;
\q2 it is melted in my gut.
\q1
\v 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd.
\q2 My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.
\q2 You have brought me into the dust of death.
\b
\q1
\v 16 For dogs have surrounded me.
\q2 A company of evildoers have enclosed me.
\q2 They have pierced my hands and feet.\f + \fr 22:16 \ft Some Heb. MT manuscripts read, "Like a lion, they are at my hands and feet." However, various other versions such as the LXX, Syr. and DSS all agree with the rendering above.\f*
\q1
\v 17 I can count all of my bones.
\q2 They look and stare at me.
\q1
\v 18 They divide my garments among them.
\q2 They cast lots for my clothing.
\b
\q1
\v 19 But do not be far off, יהוה.
\q2 You are my help: hurry to help me.
\q1
\v 20 Deliver my being from the sword,
\q2 my precious life from the power of the dog.
\q1
\v 21 Save me from the lion's mouth!
\q2 Yes, from the horns of the wild oxen,
\q2 You have answered me.
\b
\q1
\v 22 I will declare Your Name to my brothers.
\q2 Among the assembly, I will praise You.
\q1
\v 23 You who fear יהוה, praise Him!
\q2 All you seed of Ya'aqov, glorify Him!
\q2 Stand in awe of Him, all you seed of Yisra'el!
\q1
\v 24 For He has not despised nor abhorred
\q2 the affliction of the afflicted,
\q1 neither has He hidden His face from him;
\q2 but when he cried to Him, He heard.
\b
\q1
\v 25 Of You comes my praise in the great assembly.
\q2 I will pay my vows before those who fear Him.
\q1
\v 26 The humble shall eat and be satisfied.

\v 4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
\q2 I will fear no evil, for You are with me.

\v 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
\q2 You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over.

\v 7 Hear, יהוה, when I cry with my voice.
\q2 Be kind also to me, and answer me.
\q1
\v 8 When You said, "Seek My face,"

\q2 Lead me in a straight path,

\q1
\v 12 Do not deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,

\v 1 To You, יהוה, I call.
\q2 My rock, do not be deaf to me;
\q1 lest, if You are silent to me,
\q2 I would become like those who go down into the pit.
\q1
\v 2 Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to You,
\q2 when I lift up my hands toward Your Most Set-apart Place.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Do not draw me away with the wicked,
\q2 with the workers of vain exertion
\q1 who speak peace with their neighbors,
\q2 but mischief is in their hearts.
\q1
\v 4 Give them according to their work,
\q2 and according to the wickedness of their doings.
\q1 Give them according to the operation of their hands.
\q2 Bring back on them what they deserve.
\q1
\v 5 Because they do not respect the works of יהוה,
\q2 nor the operation of His hands,
\q2 He will break them down and not build them up.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Blessed be יהוה,
\q2 because He has heard the voice of my petitions.
\q1
\v 7 יהוה is my strength and my shield.
\q2 My heart has relied on Him, and I am helped.

\v 2 יהוה my Elohim, I cried to You,

\v 4 Sing praise to יהוה, You set-apart ones of His.
\q2 Give thanks to His set-apart Name.
\q1

\q2 His acceptance is for a lifetime.
\q1 Weeping may stay for the night,
\q2 but joy comes in the morning.
\b
\q1
\v 6 As for me, I said in my prosperity,
\q2 "I shall never be moved."
\q1
\v 7 You, יהוה, by Your acceptance,
\q2 made my mountain stand strong;
\q1 but when You hid Your face,
\q2 I was troubled.
\b
\q1
\v 8 I cried to You, יהוה.
\q2 I made petitions to יהוה:
\q1
\v 9 "What profit is there in my destruction,
\q2 if I go down to the pit?
\q1 Shall the dust praise You?
\q2 Shall it declare Your truth?
\q1
\v 10 Hear, יהוה, and be kind to me.
\q2 יהוה, be my helper."
\b
\q1
\v 11 You have turned my mourning into dancing for me.
\q2 You have removed my sackcloth,
\q2 and clothed me with gladness,

\v 2 Bow down Your ear to me.
\q2 Deliver me speedily.
\q1 Be to me a strong rock,
\q2 a house of defense to save me.
\b
\q1
\v 3 For You are my rock and my fortress,
\q2 therefore for Your Name's sake lead me and guide me.
\q1
\v 4 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,
\q2 for You are my stronghold.
\q1
\v 5 Into Your hand I commend my spirit.
\q2 You redeem me, יהוה, El of truth.
\b
\q1
\v 6 I hate those who gaurd lying vanities,
\q2 but I rely on יהוה.
\q1
\v 7 I will be glad and rejoice in Your loving-kindness,
\q2 for You have seen my affliction.
\q2 You have known my being in adversities.
\q1
\v 8 You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.
\q2 You have set my feet in a large place.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Be kind to me, יהוה,
\q2 for I am in distress.
\q1 My eye, my being, and my belly
\q2 waste away with grief.
\q1
\v 10 For my life is spent with sorrow,
\q2 my years with sighing.
\q1 My strength fails because of my iniquity.
\q2 My bones are wasted away.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Because of all my adversaries
\q2 I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors,
\q1 a fear to my acquaintances.
\q2 Those who saw me on the street fled from me.
\q1
\v 12 I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.
\q2 I am like broken pottery.
\q1
\v 13 For I have heard the slander of many,
\q2 terror on every side,
\q1 while they conspire together against me,
\q2 they plot to take away my life.
\b
\q1
\v 14 But I rely on You, יהוה.
\q2 I said, "You are my Elohim."
\q1
\v 15 My times are in Your hand.
\q2 Deliver me from the hand of my enemies,
\q2 and from those who persecute me.
\q1
\v 16 Make Your face to shine on Your servant.
\q2 Save me in Your loving-kindness.
\q1
\v 17 Let me not be disappointed, יהוה,
\q2 for I have called on You.
\q1 Let the wicked be disappointed.
\q2 Let them be silent in Sheol.
\q1
\v 18 Let the lying lips be mute,
\q2 which speak against the righteous insolently,
\q2 with pride and contempt.
\b
\q1
\v 19 Oh how great is Your goodness,
\q2 which You have laid up for those who fear You,
\q1 which You have worked for those who take refuge in You,
\q2 before the sons of men!
\q1
\v 20 In the secret \add place\add* of Your presence
\q2 You will hide them from the plotting of man.
\q1 You will keep them in a sukkah
\q2 away from the strife of tongues.
\b
\q1
\v 21 Praise be to יהוה,
\q2 for He has shown me His marvelous loving-kindness
\q2 in a strong city.
\q1
\v 22 As for me, I said in my haste,
\q2 "I am cut off from before Your eyes."
\q1 Nevertheless You heard the voice of my petitions
\q2 when I cried to You.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Oh love יהוה, all you His set-apart ones!
\q2 יהוה preserves the faithful,

\q2 in whose spirit there is no deceit.
\b
\q1
\v 3 When I kept silence,
\q2 my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
\q1
\v 4 For day and night Your hand was heavy on me.
\q2 My strength was sapped in the heat of summer.

\b
\q1

\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 6 For this, let everyone who is kind
\q2 pray to You in a time when You may be found.
\q1 Surely when the great waters overflow,

\v 7 You are my hiding place.
\q2 You will preserve me from trouble.
\q2 You will surround me with songs of deliverance.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b

\v 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.

\q1 who are controlled by bit and bridle,
\q2 or else they will not come near to you.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Many sorrows come to the wicked,
\q2 but loving-kindness shall surround him who relies on יהוה.

\q2 Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
\c 33
\p
\q1
\v 1 Rejoice in יהוה, you righteous!

\q2 Sing praises to Him with the harp of ten strings.
\q1
\v 3 Sing to Him a new song.
\q2 Play skillfully with a shout of joy!
\b
\q1
\v 4 For the word of יהוה is right.
\q2 All His work is done in faithfulness.
\q1
\v 5 He loves righteousness and judgment.
\q2 The earth is full of the loving-kindness of יהוה.
\b
\q1
\v 6 By the word of יהוה,
\q2 the heavens were made;
\q2 all their army by the breath of His mouth.
\q1
\v 7 He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.
\q2 He lays up the deeps in storehouses.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Let all the earth fear יהוה.
\q2 Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
\q1
\v 9 For He spoke, and it was done.
\q2 He commanded, and it stood firm.
\b

\v 10 יהוה brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.
\q2 He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.

\q1
\v 12 Blessed is the nation whose Elohim is יהוה,
\q2 the people whom He has chosen for His own inheritance.
\b
\q1
\v 13 יהוה looks from heavens.
\q2 He sees all the sons of men.
\q1
\v 14 From the place of His habitation He looks out
\q2 on all the inhabitants of the earth,
\q1
\v 15 He who fashions all of their hearts;
\q2 and He considers all of their works.
\q1
\v 16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an army.
\q2 A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
\q1
\v 17 A horse is a vain thing for safety,
\q2 neither does he deliver any by his great power.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Behold, the eye of יהוה is on those who fear Him,
\q2 on those who hope in His loving-kindness;
\q1
\v 19 to deliver their being from death,

\b
\q1
\v 20 Our being has waited for יהוה.
\q2 He is our help and our shield.

\b
\q1
\v 3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your indignation,
\q2 neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
\q1
\v 4 For my iniquities have gone over my head.
\q2 As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.

\d For the Chief Musician. For Yeduthun. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 I said, "I will guard my ways,
\q2 so that I do not sin with my tongue.
\q1 I will guard my mouth with a bridle
\q2 while the wicked is before me."
\q1
\v 2 I was mute with silence.
\q2 I held my peace, even from good.
\q1 My sorrow was stirred.
\q2
\v 3 My heart was hot within me.
\q1 While I meditated, the fire burned.
\q2 I spoke with my tongue:
\b
\q1
\v 4 "יהוה, show me my end,
\q2 what is the measure of my days.
\q2 Let me know how frail I am.
\q1
\q1
\v 5 Behold, You have made my days hand widths.
\q2 My lifetime is as nothing before You.
\q2 Surely every man stands as a breath."
\qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 6 "Surely every man walks in a shadow.\f + \fr 39:6 \fk Shadow \ft Literally "an image."\f*
\q2 Surely they busy themselves in vain.
\q2 He heaps up, and does not know who shall gather.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Now, יהוה, what do I wait for?
\q2 My hope is in You.
\q1
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions.
\q2 Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.
\q1
\v 9 I was mute. I did not open my mouth,
\q2 because You did it.
\q1
\v 10 Remove Your scourge away from me.
\q2 I am overcome by the blow of Your hand.
\q1
\v 11 When You rebuke and discipline man for iniquity,
\q2 You consume his wealth like a moth.
\q2 Surely every man is but a breath."
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 12 "Hear my prayer, יהוה,
\q2 and give ear to my cry.
\q2 Do not be silent at my tears.
\q1 For I am a sojourner with You,
\q2 a guest, as all my fathers were.
\q1
\v 13 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,
\q2 before I go away, and exist no more."
\c 40
\p
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 I waited patiently for יהוה.
\q2 He turned to me, and heard my cry.
\q1
\v 2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,
\q2 out of the miry clay.
\q1 He set my feet on a rock,
\q2 and gave me a firm place to stand.
\q1
\v 3 He has put a new song in my mouth,
\q2 even praise to our Elohim.
\q1 Many shall see it, and fear,
\q2 and shall rely on יהוה.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Blessed is the man who makes יהוה his trust,
\q2 and does not respect the proud,
\q2 nor such as turn aside to lies.
\q1
\v 5 Many, יהוה, my Elohim,
\q2 are the wonderful works which You have done,
\q2 and Your thoughts which are toward us.
\q1 They cannot be declared back to You.
\q2 If I would declare and speak of them,
\q2 they are more than can be counted.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,
\q2 but a body You have prepared for me.\f + \fr 40:6 \ft Heb. MT, Lat. and Syr. read, "Slaughtering You did not desire, but my ears You have dug." The LXX contains the verse as it is written above. However, we also find support for the Septuagint's translation in Ivrim 10:6, which quotes this verse as "…a body You have prepared for me." It is possible that the writer of the book of Ivrim was quoting the Septuagint, or perhaps an older Hebrew text on which the Septuagint was based that also read the same.\f*
\q2 You have not required ascension offering and sin offering.
\q1
\v 7 Then I said, "Behold, I have come.
\q2 It is written about me in the book in the scroll.
\q1
\v 8 I delight to do Your will, my Elohim.
\q2 Yes, Your Torah is within my gut."
\b
\q1
\v 9 I have proclaimed glad news
\q2 of righteousness in the great assembly.
\q1 Behold, I will not seal my lips,
\q2 יהוה, You know.
\q1
\v 10 I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart.
\q2 I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation.
\q1 I have not concealed Your loving-kindness
\q2 and Your truth from the great assembly.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Do not withhold Your compassion
\q2 from me, יהוה.
\q1 Let Your loving-kindness and Your truth
\q2 continually preserve me.
\q1
\v 12 For innumerable evils have surrounded me.
\q2 My iniquities have overtaken me,
\q2 so that I am not able to look up.
\q1 They are more than the hairs of my head.
\q2 My heart has failed me.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Be pleased, יהוה, to deliver me.
\q2 Hurry to help me, יהוה.
\q1
\v 14 Let them be disappointed and confounded together
\q2 who seek after my being to destroy it.
\q1 Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor
\q2 who delight in my hurt.
\q1
\v 15 Let them be desolate by reason
\q2 of their shame that tell me,
\q2 "Aha! Aha!"
\b
\q1
\v 16 Let all those who seek You rejoice
\q2 and be glad in You.
\q1 Let such as love Your salvation
\q2 say continually, "Let יהוה be exalted!"
\q1

\q2 He shall be blessed on the earth,

\q1
\v 5 My enemies speak evil against me:
\q2 "When will he die, and his name perish?"
\q1
\v 6 If he comes to see me,

\q1 His heart gathers vain exertion to itself.
\q2 When he goes abroad, he tells it.

\q2 They imagine the worst for me.
\b

\v 8 "A worthless thing", they say, "has afflicted him.
\q2 Now that he lies he shall rise up no more."
\q1
\v 9 Yes, my own familiar friend, on whom I relied,

\q2 has lifted up his heel\f + \fr 41:9 \ft Ideom meaning "to turn against."\f* against me.
\q1
\v 10 But You, יהוה,
\q2 be kind to me,
\q1 and raise me up,

\v 11 By this I know that You delight in me,

\q2 because of the oppression of the enemy?"

\q1
\v 2 You drove out the nations with Your hand,

\q1 You afflicted the peoples,

\v 11 You have made us like sheep for food,
\q2 and have scattered us among the nations.
\q1
\v 12 You sell Your people for nothing,
\q2 and have gained nothing from their sale.
\q1
\v 13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors,
\q2 a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.
\q1
\v 14 You make us a byword among the nations,
\q2 a shaking of the head among the peoples.
\q1
\v 15 All day long my dishonor is before me,

\q2 in the city of our Elohim,
\q2 in His set-apart mountain.
\q1
\v 2 Beautiful in elevation,
\q2 the joy of the whole earth,
\q1 is Mount Tsion, on the north sides,
\q2 the city of the great King.
\q1
\v 3 Elohim has shown Himself
\q2 in her citadels as a refuge.
\b
\q1
\v 4 For, behold, the kings assembled themselves,
\q2 they passed by together.
\q1
\v 5 They saw it, then they were amazed.
\q2 They were dismayed. They hurried away.

\v 6 Trembling took hold of them there,

\q1
\v 1 Hear this, all you peoples.
\q2 Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,
\q1
\v 2 both low and high,
\q2 rich and poor together.
\q1
\v 3 My mouth will speak words of wisdom.
\q2 My heart shall utter understanding.
\q1
\v 4 I will incline my ear to a proverb.
\q2 I will open my riddle on the harp.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Why should I fear in the days of evil,
\q2 when iniquity at my heels surrounds me?
\q1
\v 6 Those who rely on their wealth,
\q2 and boast in the multitude of their riches—
\q1
\v 7 none of them can by any means redeem his brother,
\q2 nor give Elohim a ransom for him.
\q1
\v 8 For the redemption of their life is costly,
\q2 no payment is ever enough,
\q1
\v 9 that he should live on forever,
\q2 that he should not see corruption.
\b
\q1
\v 10 For he sees that wise men die;
\q2 likewise the fool and the senseless perish,
\q2 and leave their wealth to others.
\q1
\v 11 Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,
\q2 and their dwelling places to all generations.
\q2 They name their lands after themselves.
\q1
\v 12 But man, despite his riches, does not endure.
\q2 He is like the animals that perish.
\b
\q1
\v 13 This is the destiny of those who are foolish,
\q2 and of those who approve their sayings.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 14 They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.
\q2 Death shall be their shepherd.
\q1 The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.
\q2 Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,
\q2 far from their mansion.
\q1
\v 15 But Elohim will redeem my being from the power of Sheol,
\q2 for He will receive me.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 16 Do not be afraid when a man is made rich,
\q2 when the glory of his house is increased;
\q1
\v 17 for when he dies he will carry nothing away.
\q2 His glory will not descend after him.
\q1
\v 18 Though while he lived he blessed his being—
\q2 and men praise you when you do well for yourself—
\q1
\v 19 he shall go to the generation of his fathers.
\q2 They shall never see the light.

\v 2 Out of Tsion, the perfection of beauty,
\q2 Elohim shines out.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Our Elohim comes, and does not keep silent.
\q2 A fire devours before Him.
\q2 It is very stormy around Him.
\q1
\v 4 He calls to the heavens above,
\q2 to the earth, that He may judge His people:
\q1
\v 5 "Gather my set-apart ones together to Me,
\q2 those who have cut a covenant with Me by sacrifice."
\q1
\v 6 The heavens shall declare His righteousness,
\q2 for Elohim Himself is judge.

\q2 I am Elohim, your Elohim.

\v 9 I have no need for a bull from your stall,

\v 10 For every animal of the forest is Mine,

\v 11 I know all the birds of the mountains.
\q2 The wild animals of the field are Mine.
\b
\q1

\q1
\v 16 But to the wicked Elohim says,
\q1 "What right do you have to declare My statutes,
\q2 that you have taken My covenant on your lips,
\q1
\v 17 since you hate correction,
\q2 and throw My words behind you?
\q1
\v 18 When you saw a thief, you consented with him,
\q2 and have participated with adulterers.
\q1
\v 19 You give your mouth to evil.
\q2 Your tongue frames deceit.
\q1
\v 20 You sit and speak against your brother.
\q2 You slander your own mother's son.
\q1
\v 21 You have done these things, and I kept silent.
\q2 You thought that I was just like you.
\q1 I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.
\b
\q1
\v 22 Now consider this, you who forget Eloah,
\q2 lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver.

\v 23 Whoever offers the slaughtering of thanksgiving
\q2 glorifies Me, and prepares his way
\q2 so that I will show the salvation of Elohim to him."

\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheva.
\q1
\v 1 Be kind to me, Elohim,

\q1 According to the multitude of Your compassion,
\q2 blot out my transgressions.
\q1
\v 2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.
\q2 Cleanse me from my sin.
\b
\q1
\v 3 For I know my transgressions.
\q2 My sin is constantly before me.
\q1
\v 4 Against You, and You only, I have sinned,
\q2 and done that which is evil in Your eyes;
\q1 that You may be proved right when You speak,
\q2 and declared right when You judge.
\q1
\v 5 Behold, I was born in iniquity.
\q2 In sin my mother conceived me.
\q1
\v 6 Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts.
\q2 You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.
\q2 Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
\q1
\v 8 Let me hear joy and gladness,
\q2 that the bones which You have broken may rejoice.
\q1
\v 9 Hide Your face from my sins,
\q2 and blot out all of my iniquities.

\v 13 Then I will teach transgressors Your ways.
\q2 Sinners shall be converted to You.

\q2 My tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.
\q1
\v 15 יהוה, open my lips.
\q2 My mouth shall declare Your praise.
\q1
\v 16 For You do not delight in sacrifice,
\q2 or else I would give it.
\q1 You have no pleasure in ascension offering.
\q1
\v 17 The sacrifices of Elohim are a broken spirit.
\q2 A broken and contrite heart,

\b
\q1
\v 18 By Your good will, do well to Tsion.

\v 1 The fool has said in his heart, "There is no Elohim."
\q2 They are corrupt, and have done abominable unrighteousness.
\q2 There is no one who does good.

\q2 who eat up my people as they eat bread,
\q2 and do not call on Elohim?
\b
\q1
\v 5 There they were in great fear,

\q2 Vain exertion and toil are also within her.
\q1
\v 11 Destructive forces are within her.
\q2 Threats and lies do not depart from her streets.

\v 12 For it was not an enemy who insulted me,
\q2 then I could have endured it.
\q1 Neither was it he who hated me
\q2 who raised himself up against me,

\q1
\v 13 But it was you, a man like me,

\v 6 Elohim has spoken from His set-apart place:
\q2 "I will triumph. I will divide Shekhem,

\v 7 Gilad is Mine, and Menasheh is Mine.
\q2 Ephrayim also is the defense of My head.
\q2 Yehudah is My scepter.

\v 9 Who will bring me into the strong city?
\q2 Who has led me to Edom?
\q1
\v 10 Have You not, Elohim, rejected us?
\q2 You do not go out with our armies, Elohim.

\v 1 Elohim, You are my El. I will earnestly seek You.
\q2 My being thirsts for You.
\q1 My flesh longs for You,
\q2 in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.

\v 4 So I will bless You while I live.

\q1
\v 1 Hear my voice, Elohim, in my complaint.
\q2 Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
\q1
\v 2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,
\q2 from the noisy crowd of the workers of vain exertion;
\q1
\v 3 who sharpen their tongue like a sword,

\q1
\v 4 to shoot innocent men from ambushes.
\q2 They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.

\v 5 They strengthen themselves in evil plans.
\q2 They talk about laying snares secretly.
\q2 They say, "Who will see them?"
\q1
\v 6 They plot unrighteousness, saying,
\q2 "We have made a perfect plan!"
\q2 Surely man's mind and heart are cunning.
\b

\v 7 But Elohim will shoot at them.
\q2 They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.
\q1
\v 8 Their own tongues shall ruin them.
\q2 All who see them will shake their heads.

\q2 Shame has covered my face.

\q1
\v 9 For the zeal of Your house consumes me.

\q1
\v 10 When I wept and I fasted,
\q2 that was to my reproach.
\q1
\v 11 When I made sackcloth my clothing,

\q2 I will make mention of Your righteousness,
\q2 even of Yours alone.
\b
\q1
\v 17 Elohim, You have taught me from my youth.
\q2 Until now, I have declared Your wondrous works.
\q1
\v 18 Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired,
\q2 Elohim, do not forsake me,
\q1 until I have declared Your strength to the next generation,
\q2 Your might to everyone who is to come.
\q1
\v 19 Your righteousness also, Elohim,
\q2 reaches to the heavens;
\q1 You have done great things.
\q2 Elohim, who is like You?
\q1
\v 20 You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles,
\q2 You will let me live.
\q1 You will bring us up again
\q2 from the depths of the earth.
\q1
\v 21 Increase my honor,
\q2 and comfort me again.
\b
\q1
\v 22 I will also praise You with the harp
\q2 for Your truth, my Elohim.
\q1 I sing praises to You with the lyre,
\q2 Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\q1
\v 23 My lips shall shout for joy!
\q2 My being, which You have redeemed,
\q2 sings praises to You!
\q1
\v 24 My tongue will also talk
\q2 about Your righteousness all day long,
\q1 for they are disappointed, and they are confounded,
\q2 who want to harm me.

\q1
\v 1 Elohim, give the king Your judgments;
\q2 Your righteousness to the royal son.
\q1
\v 2 He will judge Your people with righteousness,
\q2 and Your poor with judgment.
\q1
\v 3 The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people.
\q2 The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.
\q1
\v 4 He will judge the poor of the people.
\q2 He will save the children of the needy,
\q2 and will break the oppressor in pieces.
\b
\q1
\v 5 They shall fear You while the sun endures;
\q2 and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
\q1
\v 6 He will come down like rain on the mown grass,
\q2 as showers that water the earth.
\q1
\v 7 In His days, the righteous shall flourish,
\q2 and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.
\b
\q1
\v 8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
\q2 from the River to the ends of the earth.
\q1
\v 9 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before Him.
\q2 His enemies shall lick the dust.
\q1
\v 10 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute.
\q2 The kings of Sheva and Seva shall offer gifts.
\q1
\v 11 Yes, all kings shall bow down before Him.
\q2 All nations shall serve Him.
\b
\q1
\v 12 For He will deliver the needy when he cries;
\q2 the poor, who has no helper.
\q1
\v 13 He will have pity on the poor and needy.
\q2 He will save the beings of the needy.
\q1
\v 14 He will redeem their being from oppression and violence.
\q2 Their blood will be precious in His eyes.
\b
\q1
\v 15 They shall live,
\q2 and to Him shall be given of the gold of Sheva.
\q1 Men shall pray for Him continually.
\q2 They shall bless Him all day long.
\q1
\v 16 Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land.
\q2 Its fruit sways like Levanon.
\q1 Let it flourish,
\q2 thriving like the grass of the field.
\q1
\v 17 His Name endures forever.
\q2 His Name continues as long as the sun.

\d A Psalm by Asaph.
\q1
\v 1 Surely Elohim is good to Yisra'el,
\q2 to those who are pure in heart.
\q1
\v 2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone.
\q2 My steps had nearly slipped.
\q1
\v 3 For I was envious of the arrogant,
\q2 when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
\b
\q1
\v 4 For there are no struggles in their death,
\q2 but their strength is firm.
\q1
\v 5 They are not in toil of men,
\q2 neither are they plagued like other men.
\q1
\v 6 Therefore pride is like a necklace around their neck.
\q2 Violence covers them like a garment.
\q1
\v 7 Their eyes bulge with fat.
\q2 Their minds pass the limits of conceit.
\q1
\v 8 They scoff and speak with malice.
\q2 In arrogance, they threaten oppression.
\q1
\v 9 They have set their mouth in the heavens.
\q2 Their tongue walks through the earth.\f + \fr 73:9 \ft Idiom meaning "Arrogantly give orders."\f*
\q1
\v 10 Therefore their people return to them,
\q2 and they drink up waters of abundance.
\q1
\v 11 They say, "How does El know?
\q2 Is there knowledge in Elyon?"
\q1
\v 12 Behold, these are the wicked.
\q2 Being always at ease, they increase in riches.
\q1
\v 13 Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,
\q2 and washed my hands in innocence,
\q1
\v 14 For all day long I have been plagued,
\q2 and punished every morning.
\q1
\v 15 If I had said, "I will speak thus;"
\q2 behold, I would have deceived the generation of Your children.
\b
\q1
\v 16 When I tried to understand this,
\q2 it was toilsome for me;
\q1
\v 17 Until I entered the set-apart place of El,
\q2 and considered their latter end.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Surely You set them in slippery places.
\q2 You throw them down to destruction.
\q1
\v 19 How they are suddenly destroyed!
\q2 They are completely swept away with terrors.
\q1
\v 20 As a dream when one wakes up,
\q2 so, יהוה, when You awake,
\q2 You will despise their image.
\q1
\v 21 For my heart was soured.
\q2 I was pricked in my kidneys.
\q1
\v 22 I was so senseless and ignorant.
\q2 I was a brute beast before You.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Nevertheless, I am continually with You.
\q2 You have held my right hand.
\q1
\v 24 You will guide me with Your counsel,
\q2 and afterward receive me to glory.
\q1
\v 25 Whom do I have in heavens?
\q2 There is no one on earth whom I desire besides You.
\q1
\v 26 My flesh and my heart fails,
\q2 but Elohim is the strength of my heart
\q2 and my portion forever.
\b
\q1
\v 27 For, behold, those who are far from You shall perish.
\q2 You have destroyed all those who go whoring from You.
\q1
\v 28 But it is good for me to come close to Elohim.
\q2 I have made Adonai יהוה my refuge,
\q2 that I may tell of all Your works.

\d A contemplation by Asaph.
\q1
\v 1 Elohim, why have You rejected us forever?
\q2 Why does Your anger smolder
\q2 against the sheep of Your pasture?
\q1
\v 2 Remember Your congregation, which You purchased of old,
\q2 which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your inheritance;
\q2 Mount Tsion, in which You have lived.
\q1
\v 3 Lift up Your feet to the perpetual ruins,
\q2 all the evil that the enemy has done in the set-apart place.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Your adversaries have roared in the middle of Your assembly.
\q2 They have set up their standards as signs.
\q1
\v 5 They behaved like men wielding axes,
\q2 cutting through a thicket of trees.
\q1
\v 6 Now they break all its carved work down
\q2 with hatchet and hammers.
\q1
\v 7 They have burned Your set-apart place to the ground.
\q2 They have profaned the dwelling place of Your Name.
\q1
\v 8 They said in their heart, "We will crush them together."
\q2 They have burned up all the appointed times in the land of El.
\b
\q1
\v 9 We see no miraculous signs.
\q2 There is no longer any prophet,
\q2 neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.
\q1
\v 10 How long, Elohim, shall the adversary reproach?
\q2 Shall the enemy blaspheme Your Name forever?
\q1
\v 11 Why do You draw back Your hand,
\q2 even Your right hand?
\q1 Take it from Your chest and consume them!
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yet Elohim is my King of old,
\q2 working salvation throughout the earth.
\q1
\v 13 You divided the sea by Your strength.
\q2 You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
\q1
\v 14 You broke the heads of Livyathan in pieces.
\q2 You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.
\q1
\v 15 You opened up spring and wadi.
\q2 You dried up mighty rivers.
\q1
\v 16 The day is Yours, the night is also Yours.
\q2 You have prepared the light and the sun.
\q1
\v 17 You have set all the boundaries of the earth.
\q2 You have made summer and winter.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Remember this, that the enemy has mocked You, יהוה.
\q2 Foolish people have blasphemed Your Name.
\q1
\v 19 Do not deliver the being of Your dove to wild beasts.
\q2 Do not forget the life of Your poor forever.
\b
\q1
\v 20 Honor Your covenant,

\q1
\v 21 Do not let the oppressed return ashamed.
\q2 Let the poor and needy praise Your Name.

\v 22 Arise, Elohim! Plead Your own cause.

\q1
\v 4 I said to the arrogant, "Do not boast!" I said to the wicked, "Do not lift up the horn.
\q1
\v 5 Do not lift up your horn on high. Do not speak with a stiff neck."
\b
\q1
\v 6 For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
\q1
\v 7 But Elohim is the judge. He puts down one, and lifts up another.
\q1
\v 8 For in the hand of יהוה there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out. Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.

\v 6 At Your rebuke, Elohim of Ya'aqov, both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
\b
\q1
\v 7 You, even You, are to be feared. Who can stand in Your eyes when You are angry?

\d For the Chief Musician. To Yeduthun. A Psalm by Asaph.
\q1
\v 1 My cry goes to Elohim! Indeed, I cry to Elohim for help, and for Him to listen to me.
\q1
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I sought יהוה. My hand was stretched out in the night, and did not get tired. My being refused to be comforted.
\q1
\v 3 I remember Elohim, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 4 You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
\q1
\v 5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
\q1
\v 6 I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:
\q1
\v 7 "Will יהוה reject us forever? Will He be favorable no more?
\q1
\v 8 Has His loving-kindness vanished forever? Does His promise fail for generations?
\q1
\v 9 Has Elohim forgotten to favor? Has He, in anger, withheld His compassion?"
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 10 Then I thought, "I will appeal to this: the years of the right hand of Elyon.
\b
\q1
\v 11 I will remember the deeds of Yah; for I will remember Your wonders of old.
\q1
\v 12 I will also meditate on all Your work, and consider Your doings.
\q1
\v 13 Your way, Elohim, is in the set-apart place. What el is great like Elohim?
\q1
\v 14 You are the Elohim who does wonders. You have made Your strength known among the peoples.
\q1
\v 15 You have redeemed Your people with Your arm, the sons of Ya'aqov and Yoseph.

\q1
\v 16 The waters saw You, Elohim. The waters saw You, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.
\q1
\v 17 The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.
\q1
\v 18 The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.
\q1
\v 19 Your way was through the sea; Your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.
\q1
\v 20 You led Your people like a flock, by the hand of Mosheh and Aharon.
\c 78 
\p
\d A contemplation by Asaph.
\q1
\v 1 Hear my Torah, my people. Turn your ears to the speeches of my mouth.
\q1
\v 2 I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,
\q1
\v 3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
\q1
\v 4 We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of יהוה, His strength, and His wondrous deeds that He has done.
\b
\q1
\v 5 For He established a witness in Ya'aqov, and appointed a Torah in Yisra'el, which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;
\q1
\v 6 that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,
\q1
\v 7 that they might set their hope in Elohim, and not forget the deeds of Elohim, but preserve His commands,
\q1
\v 8 and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not faithful with Elohim.
\b
\q1
\v 9 The children of Ephrayim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
\q1
\v 10 They did not guard the covenant of Elohim, and refused to walk in His Torah.
\q1
\v 11 They forgot His doings, His wondrous deeds that He had shown them.
\q1
\v 12 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Mitsrayim, in the field of Tsoan.
\q1
\v 13 He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.
\q1
\v 14 In the daytime He also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.
\q1
\v 15 He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
\q1
\v 16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
\b
\q1
\v 17 Yet they still went on to sin against Him, to rebel against Elyon in the desert.
\q1
\v 18 They tempted Elohim in their heart by asking food for their being.
\q1
\v 19 Yes, they spoke against Elohim. They said, "Can Elohim prepare a table in the wilderness?
\q1
\v 20 Behold, He struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and wadis overflowed. Can He give bread also? Will He provide meat for His people?"
\b
\q1
\v 21 Therefore יהוה heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Ya'aqov, anger also went up against Yisra'el,
\q1
\v 22 because they did not believe in Elohim, and did not rely on His salvation.
\q1
\v 23 Yet He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heavens.
\q1
\v 24 He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the heavens.
\q1
\v 25 Man ate the bread of messengers. He sent them food to the full.
\q1
\v 26 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens. By His power He guided the south wind.
\q1
\v 27 He rained also meat on them as the dust; winged birds as the sand of the seas.
\q1
\v 28 He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations.
\q1
\v 29 So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.
\q1
\v 30 They were not estranged from their desires. Their food was yet in their mouths,
\q1
\v 31 when the anger of Elohim went up against them, killed some of their fattest, and struck down the young men of Yisra'el.
\b
\q1
\v 32 For all this they still sinned, and did not trust in His wondrous works.
\q1
\v 33 Therefore He consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.
\q1
\v 34 When He killed them, then they inquired after Him. They returned and sought Elohim earnestly.
\q1
\v 35 They remembered that Elohim was their rock, El Elyon, their redeemer.
\q1
\v 36 But they flattered Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue.
\q1
\v 37 For their heart was not right with Him, neither did they trust in His covenant.
\q1
\v 38 But He, being compassionate, atoned \add for\add* iniquity, and did not destroy them. Yes, many times He turned His anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath.
\q1
\v 39 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and does not come again.
\q1
\v 40 How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert!
\q1
\v 41 They turned again and tempted Elohim, and provoked the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\q1
\v 42 They did not remember His hand, nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary;
\q1
\v 43 how He set His signs in Mitsrayim, His wonders in the field of Tsoan,
\q1
\v 44 He turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.
\q1
\v 45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
\q1
\v 46 He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
\q1
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.
\q1
\v 48 He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
\q1
\v 49 He threw on them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of evil messengers.
\q1
\v 50 He made a path for His anger. He did not spare their being from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,
\q1
\v 51 and struck all the firstborn in Mitsrayim, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ḥam.
\q1
\v 52 But He led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
\q1
\v 53 He led them securely, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\q1
\v 54 He brought them to the border of His set-apart place, to this mountain, which His right hand had taken.
\q1
\v 55 He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Yisra'el to dwell in their tents.
\b
\q1
\v 56 Yet they tempted and rebelled against Elohim Elyon, and did not guard His witnesses;
\q1
\v 57 but turned back, and dealt deceitfully like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
\q1
\v 58 For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their engraved images.
\q1
\v 59 When Elohim heard this, He was angry, and greatly abhorred Yisra'el;
\q1
\v 60 So that He abandoned the Tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He placed among men;
\q1
\v 61 and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary's hand.
\q1
\v 62 He also gave His people over to the sword, and was angry with His inheritance.
\q1
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.
\q1
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep.
\q1
\v 65 Then יהוה awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.
\q1
\v 66 He struck His adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.
\b
\q1
\v 67 Moreover He rejected the tent of Yoseph, and did not choose the tribe of Ephrayim,
\q1
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Yehudah, Mount Tsion which He loved.
\q1
\v 69 He built His set-apart place like the heights, like the earth which He has established forever.
\q1
\v 70 He also chose David His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
\q1
\v 71 from following the ewes that have their young, He brought him to be the shepherd of Ya'aqov, His people, and Yisra'el, His inheritance.
\q1
\v 72 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

\d A Psalm by Asaph.
\q1
\v 1 Elohim, the nations have come into Your inheritance. They have defiled Your set-apart Temple. They have laid Yerushalayim in heaps.
\q1
\v 2 They have given the dead bodies of Your servants to be food for the birds of the heavens, the flesh of Your set-apart ones to the animals of the earth.
\q1
\v 3 Their blood they have shed like water around Yerushalayim. There was no one to bury them.
\q1
\v 4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.
\b
\q1
\v 5 How long, יהוה? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
\q1
\v 6 Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You; on the kingdoms that do not call on Your Name;
\q1
\v 7 For they have devoured Ya'aqov, and destroyed his homeland.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Do not hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let Your compassion speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.
\q1
\v 9 Help us, Elohim of our salvation, for the glory of Your Name. Deliver us, and atone \add for\add* our sins, for Your Name's sake.
\q1
\v 10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their Elohim?" Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for Your servants' blood is being poured out.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before You. According to the greatness of Your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.
\q1
\v 12 Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached You, יהוה.

\v 10 Do You show wonders to the dead? Do the Rephaim rise up and praise You?

\v 16 Your fierce wrath has gone over me. Your terrors have cut me off.

\v 11 יהוה knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Blessed is the man whom You discipline, Yah, and teach out of Your Torah;
\q1
\v 13 that You may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked.
\q1
\v 14 For יהוה will not reject His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance.
\q1
\v 15 For judgment will return to righteousness. All the upright in heart shall follow it.
\b
\q1
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against the workers of vain exertion?
\q1
\v 17 Unless יהוה had been my help, my being would have soon lived in silence.
\q1
\v 18 When I said, "My foot is slipping!" Your loving-kindness, יהוה, sustained me.
\q1
\v 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, Your comforts delight my being.
\q1
\v 20 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with You, which brings about toil by statute?
\q1
\v 21 They gather themselves together against the being of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
\q1
\v 22 But יהוה has been my high tower, my Elohim, the rock of my refuge.
\q1
\v 23 He has brought on them their own vain exertion, and will cut them off in their own wickedness. יהוה, our Elohim, will cut them off.
\q1

\p
\q1
\v 1 Oh come, let us sing to יהוה. Let us shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!
\q1
\v 2 Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving. Let us extol Him with songs!
\q1
\v 3 For יהוה is a great El, a great King above all elohim.
\q1
\v 4 In His hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also His.
\q1
\v 5 The sea is His, and He made it. His hands formed the dry land.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Oh come, let us bow down and kneel. Let us bless before יהוה, our Maker,
\q1
\v 7 for He is our Elohim. We are the people of His pasture, and the sheep in His care. Today, oh that you would hear His voice!
\q1
\v 8 "Do not harden your heart, as at Merivah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
\q1
\v 9 when your fathers tempted Me, tested Me, and saw My work.
\q1
\v 10 Forty long years I was grieved with that generation, and said, 'It is a people that errs in their heart. They have not known My ways.'
\q1
\v 11 Therefore I swore in My wrath, 'they will not enter into My rest.'"
\c 96 
\p
\q1
\v 1 Sing to יהוה a new song! Sing to יהוה, all the earth.
\q1
\v 2 Sing to יהוה! Bless His Name! Proclaim His salvation from day to day!
\q1
\v 3 Declare His glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all the peoples.
\q1
\v 4 For great is יהוה, and greatly to be praised! He is to be feared above all elohim.
\q1
\v 5 For all the elohim of the peoples are idols, but יהוה made the heavens.
\q1
\v 6 Honor and majesty are before Him. Strength and beauty are in His set-apart place.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Ascribe to יהוה, you families of nations, ascribe to יהוה glory and strength.
\q1
\v 8 Ascribe to יהוה the glory due to His Name. Bring an offering, and come into His courts.
\q1
\v 9 Bow down to יהוה in set-apart array. Tremble before Him, all the earth.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Say among the nations, "יהוה reigns." The world is also established. It cannot be moved. He will judge the peoples with uprightness.
\q1
\v 11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and its fullness!
\q1
\v 12 Let the field and all that is in it exult! Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy
\q1
\v 13 before יהוה; for He comes, for He comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples with His faithfulness.
\c 97 
\p
\q1
\v 1 יהוה reigns! Let the earth rejoice! Let the multitude of islands be glad!
\q1
\v 2 Clouds and darkness are around Him. Righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.
\q1
\v 3 A fire goes before Him, and burns up His adversaries on every side.
\q1
\v 4 His lightning lights up the world. The earth sees, and trembles.
\q1
\v 5 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of יהוה, at the presence of the Master of the whole earth.
\b
\q1
\v 6 The heavens declare His righteousness. All the peoples have seen His glory.
\q1
\v 7 Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images, who boast in their idols. Bow down to Him, all you elohim!\f + \fr 97:7 \ft LXX reads, "messengers" here instead of "elohim."\f*
\b
\q1
\v 8 Tsion heard and was glad. The daughters of Yehudah rejoiced, because of Your judgments, יהוה.
\q1
\v 9 For You, יהוה, are Elyon above all the earth. You are exalted far above all elohim.
\b
\q1
\v 10 You who love יהוה, hate evil. He guards the beings of His set-apart ones. He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
\q1
\v 11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
\q1
\v 12 Be glad in יהוה, you righteous people! Give thanks to His set-apart Name.
\c 98 
\p
\d A Psalm.
\q1
\v 1 Sing to יהוה a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand, and His set-apart arm, have worked salvation for Him.
\q1
\v 2 יהוה has made known His salvation. He has openly shown His righteousness in the sight of the nations.
\q1
\v 3 He has remembered His loving-kindness and His faithfulness toward the house of Yisra'el. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our Elohim.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Make a joyful noise to יהוה, all the earth! Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing praises!
\q1
\v 5 Sing praises to יהוה with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody.
\q1
\v 6 With trumpets and voice of \add the\add* shofar, make a joyful noise before the King, יהוה.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Let the sea roar with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell therein.
\q1
\v 8 Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the mountains sing for joy together.
\q1
\v 9 Let them sing before יהוה, for He comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with uprightness.
\c 99 
\p
\q1
\v 1 יהוה reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned among the keruvim. Let the earth be moved.
\q1
\v 2 יהוה is great in Tsion. He is high above all the peoples.
\q1
\v 3 Let them praise Your great and awesome Name. He is set-apart!
\q1
\v 4 The King's strength also loves judgment. You do establish uprightness. You execute judgment and righteousness in Ya'aqov.
\q1
\v 5 Exalt יהוה our Elohim. Bow down at His footstool. He is set-apart!
\b
\q1
\v 6 Mosheh and Aharon were among His priests, Shemu'el among those who call on His Name; they called on יהוה, and He answered them.
\q1
\v 7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They guarded His witnesses, the statute that He gave them.
\b
\q1
\v 8 You answered them, יהוה our Elohim. You are an El who forgave them, although You took vengeance for their doings.
\q1
\v 9 Exalt יהוה, our Elohim. Bown down at His set-apart hill, for יהוה, our Elohim, is set-apart!
\c 100 
\p
\d A Psalm of thanksgiving.
\q1
\v 1 Shout for joy to יהוה, all you lands!
\b
\q1
\v 2 Serve יהוה with gladness. Come before His presence with singing.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Know that יהוה, He is Elohim. It is He who has made us, and we are His. We are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, into His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him, and bless His Name.
\b
\q1
\v 5 For יהוה is good. His loving-kindness endures forever, His faithfulness to all generations.
\c 101 
\p
\d A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 I will sing of loving-kindness and judgment. To You, יהוה, I will sing praises.
\q1
\v 2 I will be careful to live a blameless life. When will You come to me? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.
\q1
\v 3 I will set no worthless thing before my eyes. I hate the deeds of those that turn aside. They will not cling to me.
\q1
\v 4 A perverse heart will be far from me. I will have nothing to do with evil.
\b
\q1
\v 5 I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor. I will not tolerate one who is haughty and conceited.
\b
\q1
\v 6 My eyes \add will be\add* on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me.
\b
\q1
\v 7 He who practices deceit will not dwell within my house. He who speaks falsehood will not be established before my eyes.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of vain exertion from the city of יהוה.
\c 102 
\p
\d A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before יהוה.
\q1
\v 1 Hear my prayer, יהוה! Let my cry come to You.
\q1
\v 2 Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my distress. Turn Your ear to me. Answer me quickly in the day when I call.
\b
\q1
\v 3 For my days consume away like smoke. My bones are burned as a torch.
\q1
\v 4 My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, for I forget to eat my bread.
\q1
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones stick to my skin.
\q1
\v 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I have become as an owl of the waste places.
\q1
\v 7 I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop.
\q1
\v 8 My enemies reproach me all day. Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.
\q1
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears.
\q1
\v 10 Because of Your indignation and Your wrath, for You have taken me up, and thrown me away.
\q1
\v 11 My days are like a long shadow. I have withered like grass.
\b
\q1
\v 12 But You, יהוה, will remain forever; Your renown endures to all generations.
\q1
\v 13 You will arise and have compassion on Tsion; for it is time to be kind to her. Yes, the set time has come.
\q1
\v 14 For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity on her dust.
\q1
\v 15 So the nations will fear the Name of יהוה; all the kings of the earth, Your glory.
\q1
\v 16 For יהוה has built up Tsion. He has appeared in His glory.
\q1
\v 17 He has responded to the prayer of the destitute, and has not despised their prayer.
\b
\q1
\v 18 This will be written for the generation to come. A people which will be created will praise Yah.
\q1
\v 19 For He has looked down from the height of His set-apart place. From heavens, יהוה saw the earth;
\q1
\v 20 to hear the groans of the prisoner; to free those who are condemned to death;
\q1
\v 21 that men may declare the Name of יהוה in Tsion, and His praise in Yerushalayim;
\q1
\v 22 when the peoples are gathered together, the kingdoms, to serve יהוה.
\b
\q1
\v 23 He weakened my strength along the course. He shortened my days.
\q1
\v 24 I said, "My El, do not take me away in the middle of my days. Your years are throughout all generations.
\b
\q1
\v 25 Of old, You laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the work of Your hands.
\q1
\v 26 They will perish, but You will endure. Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment. You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.
\q1
\v 27 But You are the same. Your years will have no end.
\q1
\v 28 The children of Your servants will continue. Their seed will be established before You."
\c 103 
\p
\d By David.
\q1
\v 1 Praise יהוה, my being! All that is within me, praise His set-apart Name!
\q1
\v 2 Praise יהוה, my being, and do not forget all His benefits;
\q1
\v 3 who forgives all your sins; who heals all your diseases;
\q1
\v 4 who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with loving-kindness and compassions;
\q1
\v 5 who satisfies your desire with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
\b
\q1
\v 6 יהוה executes righteous acts, and judgments for all who are oppressed.
\q1
\v 7 He made known His ways to Mosheh, his deeds to the children of Yisra'el.
\q1
\v 8 יהוה is compassionate and kind, slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness.
\q1
\v 9 He will not always accuse; neither will He stay angry forever.
\q1
\v 10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us for our iniquities.
\q1
\v 11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His loving-kindness toward those who fear Him.
\q1
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
\q1
\v 13 Like a father has compassion on his children, so יהוה has compassion on those who fear Him.
\q1
\v 14 For He knows how we are inclined. He remembers that we are dust.
\b
\q1
\v 15 As for man, his days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
\q1
\v 16 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. Its place remembers it no more.
\q1
\v 17 But the loving-kindness of יהוה is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear Him, His righteousness to children's children;
\q1
\v 18 to those who guard His covenant, to those who remember to obey His precepts.
\q1
\v 19 יהוה has established His throne in the heavens. His kingdom rules over all.
\b
\q1
\v 20 Praise יהוה, you messengers of His, who are mighty in strength, who fulfill His word, obeying the voice of His word.
\q1
\v 21 Praise יהוה, all you armies of His, you servants of His, who do His will.
\q1
\v 22 Praise יהוה, all you works of His, in all places of His dominion. Praise יהוה, my being!
\c 104 
\p
\q1
\v 1 Bless יהוה, my being. יהוה, my Elohim, You are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty.
\q1
\v 2 He covers Himself with light as with a garment. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.
\q1
\v 3 He lays the beams of His rooms in the waters. He makes the clouds His chariot. He walks on the wings of the wind.
\q1
\v 4 He makes His messengers winds; His servants flames of fire.
\b
\q1
\v 5 He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved forever.
\q1
\v 6 You covered it with the deep as with a cloak. The waters stood above the mountains.
\q1
\v 7 At Your rebuke they fled. At the voice of Your thunder they hurried away.
\q1
\v 8 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place which You had assigned to them.
\q1
\v 9 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over; that they do not turn again to cover the earth.
\b
\q1
\v 10 He sends springs into the wadis. They run among the mountains.
\q1
\v 11 They give drink to every animal of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
\q1
\v 12 The birds of the heavens nest by them. They sing among the branches.
\q1
\v 13 He waters the mountains from His rooms. The earth is filled with the fruit of Your works.
\b
\q1
\v 14 He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for the service of man, that he may produce food out of the earth:
\q1
\v 15 wine that makes glad the heart of man, oil to make his face to shine, and bread that sustains man's heart.
\b
\q1
\v 16 The trees of יהוה are well watered, the cedars of Levanon, which He has planted;
\q1
\v 17 where the birds make their nests. The stork makes its home in the cypress trees.
\q1
\v 18 The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the shaphan.
\b
\q1
\v 19 He appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows when to set.
\q1
\v 20 You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals of the forest prowl.
\q1
\v 21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from El.
\q1
\v 22 The sun rises, and they steal away, and lay down in their dens.
\q1
\v 23 Man goes out to his deeds, to his service until evening.
\b
\q1
\v 24 יהוה, how many are Your works! In wisdom have You made them all. The earth is full of Your riches.
\q1
\v 25 There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable living things, both small and large animals.
\q1
\v 26 There the ships go, and Livyathan, whom You formed to play there.
\b
\q1
\v 27 These all wait for You, that You may give them their food in due season.
\q1
\v 28 You give to them; they gather. You open Your hand; they are satisfied with good.
\q1
\v 29 You hide Your face: they are troubled; You take away their breath: they die, and return to the dust.
\q1
\v 30 You send out Your Ruaḥ and they are created. You renew the face of the ground.
\b
\q1
\v 31 Let the glory of יהוה endure forever. Let יהוה rejoice in His works.
\q1
\v 32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
\q1
\v 33 I will sing to יהוה as long as I live. I will sing praise to my Elohim while I have any being.
\q1
\v 34 Let my meditation be sweet to Him. I will rejoice in יהוה.
\q1
\v 35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. Let the wicked be no more. Bless יהוה, my being. Praise Yah!
\c 105 
\p
\q1
\v 1 Give thanks to יהוה! Call on His Name! Make His doings known among the peoples.
\q1
\v 2 Sing to Him, sing praises to Him! Tell of all His marvelous works.
\q1
\v 3 Glory in His set-apart Name. Let the heart of those who seek יהוה rejoice.
\q1
\v 4 Seek יהוה and His strength. Seek His face forever more.
\q1
\v 5 Remember His marvelous works that He has done; His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,
\q1
\v 6 you seed of Avraham, His servant, you children of Ya'aqov, His chosen ones.
\b
\q1
\v 7 He is יהוה, our Elohim. His judgments are in all the earth.
\q1
\v 8 He has remembered His covenant forever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
\q1
\v 9 the covenant which He cut with Avraham, His oath to Yitsḥaq,
\q1
\v 10 and confirmed the same to Ya'aqov for a statute; to Yisra'el for an everlasting covenant,
\q1
\v 11 saying, "To you I will give the land of Kena'an, the lot of your inheritance;"
\b
\q1
\v 12 when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and sojourners in it.
\q1
\v 13 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.
\q1
\v 14 He allowed no one to do them wrong. Yes, He reproved kings for their sakes,
\q1
\v 15 "Do not touch My anointed ones! Do My prophets no harm!"
\b
\q1
\v 16 He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies.
\q1
\v 17 He sent a man before them. Yoseph was sold for a slave.
\q1
\v 18 They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons,
\q1
\v 19 until the time that His word came, and the speeches of יהוה tried.
\q1
\v 20 The king sent and freed him; even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
\q1
\v 21 He made him master of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions;
\q1
\v 22 to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Yisra'el also came into Mitsrayim. Ya'aqov lived in the land of Ḥam.
\q1
\v 24 He increased His people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.
\q1
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate His people, to conspire against His servants.
\b
\q1
\v 26 He sent Mosheh, His servant, and Aharon, whom He had chosen.
\q1
\v 27 They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ḥam.
\q1
\v 28 He sent darkness, and made it dark. They did not rebel against His words.
\q1
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.
\q1
\v 30 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the rooms of their kings.
\q1
\v 31 He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.
\q1
\v 32 He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.
\q1
\v 33 He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
\q1
\v 34 He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number,
\q1
\v 35 ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit of their ground.
\q1
\v 36 He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their manhood.
\b
\q1
\v 37 He brought them out with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among His tribes.
\q1
\v 38 Mitsrayim was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen on them.
\b
\q1
\v 39 He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.
\q1
\v 40 They asked, and He brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of the heavens.
\q1
\v 41 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places.
\q1
\v 42 For He remembered His set-apart word, and Avraham, His servant.
\b
\q1
\v 43 He brought His people out with joy, His chosen ones with singing.
\q1
\v 44 He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the toil of the peoples in possession,
\q1
\v 45 that they might guard His statutes, and preserve His Torot. Praise Yah!
\c 106 
\p
\q1
\v 1 Praise יהוה! Give thanks to יהוה, for He is good, for His loving-kindness endures forever.
\q1
\v 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of יהוה, or fully declare all His praise?
\q1
\v 3 Blessed are those who keep judgment. Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Remember me, יהוה, with the acceptance that You show to Your people. Visit me with Your salvation,
\q1
\v 5 that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that I may glory with Your inheritance.
\b
\q1
\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.
\q1
\v 7 Our fathers did not understand Your wonders in Mitsrayim. They did not remember the multitude of Your loving-kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Sea of Reeds.
\q1
\v 8 Nevertheless He saved them for His Name's sake, that He might make His mighty power known.
\q1
\v 9 He rebuked the Sea of Reeds also, and it was dried up; so He led them through the depths, as through a desert.
\q1
\v 10 He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
\q1
\v 11 The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.
\q1
\v 12 Then they believed His words. They sang His praise.
\b
\q1
\v 13 They soon forgot His works. They did not wait for His counsel,
\q1
\v 14 but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested El in the wasteland.
\q1
\v 15 He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their being.
\b
\q1
\v 16 They envied Mosheh also in the camp, and Aharon, the set-apart one of יהוה.
\q1
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Aviram.
\q1
\v 18 A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.
\b
\q1
\v 19 They made a calf in Ḥorev, and bowed down to a molten image.
\q1
\v 20 Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass.
\q1
\v 21 They forgot El, their Savior, who had done great things in Mitsrayim,
\q1
\v 22 Wondrous works in the land of Ḥam, and awesome things by the Sea of Reeds.
\q1
\v 23 Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had Mosheh, His chosen, not stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, so that He would not destroy them.
\b
\q1
\v 24 Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They did not believe His word,
\q1
\v 25 but murmured in their tents, and did not listen to the voice of יהוה.
\q1
\v 26 Therefore He swore to them that He would overthrow them in the wilderness,
\q1
\v 27 that He would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.
\b
\q1
\v 28 They joined themselves also to Ba'al Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
\q1
\v 29 Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.
\q1
\v 30 Then Pineḥas stood up, and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.
\q1
\v 31 That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come.
\b
\q1
\v 32 They angered Him also at the waters of Merivah, so that Mosheh was troubled for their sakes;
\q1
\v 33 because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.
\b
\q1
\v 34 They did not destroy the peoples, as יהוה commanded them,
\q1
\v 35 but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.
\q1
\v 36 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
\q1
\v 37 Yes, they slaughtered their sons and their daughters to demons.
\q1
\v 38 They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they slaughtered to the idols of Kena'an. The land was polluted with blood.
\q1
\v 39 Thus were they defiled with their works, and whored themselves in their deeds.
\b
\q1
\v 40 Therefore יהוה burned with anger against His people. He abhorred His inheritance.
\q1
\v 41 He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.
\q1
\v 42 Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.
\q1
\v 43 He rescued them many times, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.
\b
\q1
\v 44 Nevertheless He regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.
\q1
\v 45 He remembered for them His covenant, and relented according to the multitude of His loving-kindnesses.
\q1
\v 46 He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.
\b
\q1
\v 47 Save us, יהוה, our Elohim, gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to Your set-apart Name, to triumph in Your praise!
\b

\v 3 And gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.

\q1
\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in.
\q1
\v 5 Hungry and thirsty, their being fainted in them.
\q1
\v 6 Then they cried to יהוה in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses,
\q1
\v 7 He led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city to live in.
\q1
\v 8 Let them praise יהוה for His loving-kindness, for His wonderful deeds to the children of men!
\q1
\v 9 For He satisfies the longing being. He fills the hungry being with good.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,
\q1
\v 11 because they rebelled against the speeches of El, and condemned the counsel of Elyon.
\q1
\v 12 Therefore He brought down their heart with toil. They fell down, and there was no one to help.
\q1
\v 13 Then they cried to יהוה in their trouble, and He saved them out of their distresses.
\q1
\v 14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke away their chains.
\q1
\v 15 Let them praise יהוה for His loving-kindness, for His wonderful deeds to the children of men!
\q1
\v 16 For He has broken the gates of copper, and cut through bars of iron.
\b
\q1
\v 17 Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because of their iniquities.
\q1
\v 18 Their being abhors all kinds of food. They draw near to the gates of death.
\q1
\v 19 Then they cry to יהוה in their trouble, He saves them out of their distresses.
\q1
\v 20 He sends His word, and heals them, and delivers them from their graves.
\q1
\v 21 Let them praise יהוה for His loving-kindness, for His wonderful deeds to the children of men!
\q1
\v 22 Let them slaughter the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His deeds with singing.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters;
\q1
\v 24 These see the deeds of יהוה, and His wonders in the deep.
\q1
\v 25 For He commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.
\q1
\v 26 They mount up to the heavens; they go down again to the depths. Their being melts away because of trouble.
\q1
\v 27 They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.
\q1
\v 28 Then they cry to יהוה in their trouble, and He brings them out of their distress.
\q1
\v 29 He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
\q1
\v 30 Then they are glad because it is calm, so He brings them to their desired haven.
\q1
\v 31 Let them praise יהוה for His loving-kindness, for His wonderful deeds for the children of men!
\q1
\v 32 Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, and praise Him in the seat of the elders.
\b
\q1
\v 33 He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,
\q1
\v 34 and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
\q1
\v 35 He turns \add the\add* wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs.
\q1
\v 36 There He makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city to live in,
\q1
\v 37 sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.
\q1
\v 38 He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. He does not allow their livestock to decrease.
\b
\q1
\v 39 Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
\q1
\v 40 He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.
\q1
\v 41 Yet He lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases their families like a flock.
\q1
\v 42 The upright will see it, and be glad. All the unrighteous will shut their mouths.
\b
\q1
\v 43 Whoever is wise? Let him guard these things, and consider the loving-kindnesses of יהוה.

\q1

\q1
\v 10 Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom?
\q1
\v 11 Have You not rejected us, Elohim? You do not go out, Elohim, with our armies.
\q1
\v 12 Give us help against the enemy, for the help of man is vain.

\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 Elohim of my praise, do not remain silent,
\q1
\v 2 for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me. They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.
\q1
\v 3 They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
\q1
\v 4 In return for my love, they are my adversaries; but I am in prayer.
\q1
\v 5 They have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Set a wicked man over him. Let an adversary stand at his right hand.
\q1
\v 7 When he is judged, let him come out wicked. Let his prayer be turned into sin.
\q1
\v 8 Let his days be few. Let another take his office.
\q1
\v 9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
\q1
\v 10 Let his children be wandering beggars. Let them be sought from their ruins.
\q1
\v 11 Let the creditor seize all that he has. Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.
\q1
\v 12 Let there be no one to extend loving-kindness to him, neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children.
\q1
\v 13 Let his posterity be cut off. In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
\q1
\v 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by יהוה. Do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
\q1
\v 15 Let them be before יהוה continually, that He may cut off their memory from the earth;
\b
\q1
\v 16 because he did not remember to show loving-kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy man, the broken in heart, to kill them.
\q1
\v 17 Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him. He did not delight in blessing, and it was far from him.
\q1
\v 18 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment. It came into his inward parts like water, like oil into his bones.
\q1
\v 19 Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself, for the belt that is always around him.
\q1
\v 20 This is the reward of my adversaries from יהוה, of those who speak evil against my being.
\b
\q1
\v 21 But deal with me, Adonai יהוה, for Your Name's sake, because Your loving-kindness is good, deliver me;
\q1
\v 22 for I am poor and needy. My heart is wounded within me.
\q1
\v 23 I fade away like an evening shadow. I am shaken off like a locust.
\q1
\v 24 My knees are weak through fasting. My body is thin and lacks fat.
\q1
\v 25 I have also become a reproach to them. When they see me, they shake their head.
\b
\q1
\v 26 Help me, יהוה, my Elohim. Save me according to Your loving-kindness;
\q1
\v 27 that they may know that this is Your hand; that You, יהוה, have done it.
\q1
\v 28 They may curse, but You bless. When they arise, they will be shamed, but Your servant shall rejoice.
\q1
\v 29 Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor. Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
\b
\q1
\v 30 I will give great thanks to יהוה with my mouth. Yes, I will praise Him among the multitude.

\v 12 If your children will guard My covenant, My witness that I will teach them, their children also will sit on your throne forever more."
\b
\q1
\v 13 For יהוה has chosen Tsion. He has desired it for His habitation.
\q1
\v 14 "This is My resting place forever. Here I will live, for I have desired it.
\q1
\v 15 I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread.
\q1
\v 16 Her priests I will also clothe with salvation. Her set-apart ones will shout aloud for joy.
\q1
\v 17 There I will make the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for My anointed.
\q1
\v 18 I will clothe His enemies with shame, but on Himself, His crown will be resplendent."

\d A Song of Ascents. By David.
\q1
\v 1 See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity!
\q1
\v 2 It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aharon's beard; that came down on the edge of his robes;
\q1
\v 3 like the dew of Ḥermon, that comes down on the hills of Tsion: for there יהוה gives the blessing, even life forever more.
\c 134 
\p
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q1
\v 1 Look! Praise יהוה, all you servants of יהוה, who stand by night in the house of יהוה!
\q1
\v 2 Lift up your hands in the set-apart place. Praise יהוה!
\b
\q1
\v 3 May יהוה bless you from Tsion; even He who made heavens and earth.

\q1
\v 1 Praise Yah! Praise the Name of יהוה! Praise Him, you servants of יהוה,

\q1
\v 3 Praise Yah, for יהוה is good. Sing praises to His Name, for that is pleasant.
\q1
\v 4 For Yah has chosen Ya'aqov for Himself; Yisra'el for His own possession.
\b
\q1
\v 5 For I know that יהוה is great, that Adonai is above all elohim.
\q1
\v 6 Whatever יהוה pleased, that He has done, in heavens and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
\q1
\v 7 who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings the wind out of His treasuries.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Who struck the firstborn of Mitsrayim, both of man and animal.
\q1
\v 9 Who sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Mitsrayim, on Pharaoh, and on all His servants;
\q1
\v 10 who struck many nations, and killed mighty kings,
\q1
\v 11 Siḥon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Kena'an,
\q1
\v 12 and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Yisra'el, His people.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Your Name, יהוה, endures forever; Your renown, יהוה, throughout all generations.
\q1
\v 14 For יהוה will judge His people, and have compassion on His servants.
\b
\q1
\v 15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
\q1
\v 16 They have mouths, but they cannot speak. They have eyes, but they cannot see.
\q1
\v 17 They have ears, but they cannot hear; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
\q1
\v 18 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who relies on them.

\q1
\v 19 House of Yisra'el, praise יהוה! House of Aharon, praise יהוה!

\q1
\v 1 By the rivers of Bavel, there we sat down. Yes, we wept, when we remembered Tsion.
\q1
\v 2 On the willows in that land, we hung up our harps.
\q1
\v 3 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs. Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: "Sing us one of the songs of Tsion!"
\b
\q1
\v 4 How can we sing the song of יהוה in a foreign land?
\q1
\v 5 If I forget you, Yerushalayim, let my right hand forget its skill.
\q1
\v 6 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you; if I do not prefer Yerushalayim above my chief joy.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Remember, יהוה, against the children of Edom, the day of Yerushalayim; who said, "Raze it! Raze it even to its foundation!"
\q1
\v 8 Daughter of Bavel, doomed to destruction, he will be happy who rewards you, as you have served us.
\q1
\v 9 Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.

\q1
\v 2 I will bow down toward Your set-apart Temple, and give thanks to Your Name for Your loving-kindness and for Your truth; for You have exalted Your Name and Your speeches above all.
\q1
\v 3 In the day that I called, You answered me. You assured me with strength in my being.
\b
\q1
\v 4 All the kings of the earth will give You thanks, יהוה, for they have heard the speeches of Your mouth.
\q1
\v 5 Yes, they will sing of the ways of יהוה; for great is the glory of יהוה.
\q1
\v 6 For though יהוה is high, yet He looks after the lowly; but the proud, He knows from afar.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Though I walk in the middle of trouble, You will revive me. You will stretch out Your hand against the wrath of my enemies. Your right hand will save me.

\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 יהוה, You have searched me, and You know me.
\q1
\v 2 You know my sitting down and my rising up. You perceive my thoughts from afar.
\q1
\v 3 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.
\q1
\v 4 For there is not a saying on my tongue, but, behold, יהוה, You know it altogether.
\q1
\v 5 You hem me in behind and before. You laid Your hand on me.
\q1
\v 6 This knowledge is beyond me. It is lofty. I cannot attain it.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Where could I go from Your Ruaḥ? Or where could I flee from Your presence?
\q1
\v 8 If I ascend up into the heavens, You are there. If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there!
\q1
\v 9 If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea;
\q1
\v 10 Even there Your hand will lead me, and Your right hand will hold me.
\q1
\v 11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me; the light around me will be night;"
\q1
\v 12 even the darkness does not hide from You, but the night shines as the day. The darkness is like light to You.
\b
\q1
\v 13 For You formed my kidneys. You knit me together in my mother's womb.
\q1
\v 14 I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. My being knows that very well.
\q1
\v 15 My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, woven together in the depths of the earth.
\q1
\v 16 Your eyes saw my body. In Your book they were all written, the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were none of them.
\b
\q1
\v 17 How precious to me are Your thoughts, El! How vast is their sum!
\q1
\v 18 If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I wake up, I am still with You.
\b
\q1
\v 19 If only You, Eloah, would kill the wicked. Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!
\q1
\v 20 For they speak against You wickedly. Bring Your enemies to naught!
\q1
\v 21 יהוה, do I not hate those who hate You? Am I not grieved with those who rise up against You?
\q1
\v 22 I hate them with perfect hatred. They have become my enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Search me, El, and know my heart. Try me, and know my thoughts.

\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 Deliver me, יהוה, from the evil man. Preserve me from the violent man;

\q1
\v 3 They have sharpened their tongues like a naḥash. Viper's poison is under their lips.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 4 יהוה, guard me from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.
\q1
\v 5 The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords of a net by the path. They have set traps for me.
\qs Selah.\qs*

\v 6 I said to יהוה, "You are my El." Listen to the cry of my petitions, יהוה.
\q1
\v 7 Adonai יהוה, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.

\v 8 יהוה, do not grant the desires of the wicked. Do not let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 9 As for the head of those who surround me, let the toil of their own lips cover them.
\q1
\v 10 Let burning coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, from where they never rise.
\q1
\v 11 An evil speaker will not be established in the earth. Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

\d A Psalm by David.

\v 1 יהוה, I have called on You. Come to me quickly! Listen to my voice when I call to You.
\q1
\v 2 Let my prayer be set before You like incense; the lifting up of my hands like the evening offering.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Set a watch, יהוה, before my mouth. Preserve the door of my lips.
\q1
\v 4 Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work vain exertion. Do not let me eat of their delicacies.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Let the righteous strike me, it is loving-kindness; let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head; do not let my head refuse it; Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.
\q1
\v 6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. They will hear my speeches, for they are well spoken.

\q1
\v 2 I pour out my complaint before Him. I tell Him my troubles.
\b
\q1
\v 3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, You knew my route. On the path in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.
\q1
\v 4 Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned for me. Refuge has fled from me. No one cares for my being.
\b
\q1
\v 5 I cried to You, יהוה. I said, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."
\q1
\v 6 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need. deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than me.
\q1
\v 7 Bring my being out of prison, that I may give thanks to Your Name. The righteous will surround me, for You will be good to me.

\p
\d A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 Hear my prayer, יהוה. Listen to my petitions. In Your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.
\q1
\v 2 Do not enter into judgment with Your servant, for in Your eyes no man living is righteous.
\b
\q1
\v 3 For the enemy pursues my being. He has struck my life down to the ground. He has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead.
\q1
\v 4 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is desolate.
\b
\q1
\v 5 I remember the days of old. I meditate on all Your doings. I contemplate the work of Your hands.
\q1
\v 6 I spread out my hands to You. My being thirsts for You, like a parched land.
\qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 7 Hurry to answer me, יהוה. My spirit fails. Do not hide Your face from me, so that I do not become like those who go down into the pit.
\q1
\v 8 Cause me to hear Your loving-kindness in the morning, for I rely on You. Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my being to You.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Deliver me, יהוה, from my enemies. I flee to You to hide me.
\q1
\v 10 Teach me to do Your will, for You are my Eloah. Your Ruaḥ is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness.

\v 11 Revive me, יהוה, for Your Name's sake. In Your righteousness, bring my being out of trouble.

\q1
\v 4 Man is like a breath. His days are like a shadow that passes away.

\q1
\v 5 Part Your heavens, יהוה, and come down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
\q1
\v 6 Throw out lightning, and scatter them. Send out Your arrows, and rout them.
\q1
\v 7 Stretch out Your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hands of foreigners;
\q1
\v 8 whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

\v 10 You are He who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David, His servant, from the deadly sword.
