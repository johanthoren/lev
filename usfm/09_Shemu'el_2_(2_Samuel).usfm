\v 1 It happened after the death of Sha'ul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amaleqites, and David had stayed two days in Tsiqlag;
\v 2 it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Sha'ul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and bowed down.
\v 3 David said to him, "Where do you come from?" He said to him, "I have escaped out of the camp of Yisra'el."
\v 4 David said to him, "How did it go? Please tell me." He answered, "The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Sha'ul and Yehonathan his son are dead also."
\p
\v 5 David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Sha'ul and Yehonathan his son are dead?"
\p
\v 6 The young man who told him said, "As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Sha'ul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
\v 7 When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, 'Here I am.'
\v 8 He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amaleqite.'
\v 9 He said to me, 'Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my being is yet whole in me.'
\v 10 So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my master."
\p
\v 11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him.
\v 12 They mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Sha'ul, and for Yehonathan his son, and for the people of יהוה, and for the house of Yisra'el; because they were fallen by the sword.
\v 13 David said to the young man who told him, "Where are you from?" He answered, "I am the son of a sojourner, an Amaleqite."
\p
\v 14 David said to him, "How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the anointed of יהוה?
\v 15 David called one of the young men, and said, "Go near, and fall on him." He struck him, so that he died.
\v 16 David said to him, "Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have slain the anointed of יהוה.'"
\p
\v 17 David lamented with this lamentation over Sha'ul and over Yehonathan his son;
\v 18 and he commanded them to teach the children of Yehudah to use the bow: behold, it is written in the Book of the Upright:
\p
\v 19 "Your glory, Yisra'el, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
\p
\v 20 Do not tell it in Gath. Do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashqelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
\p
\v 21 You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Sha'ul was not anointed with oil.
\p
\v 22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, Yehonathan's bow did not turn back. Sha'ul's sword did not return empty.
\p
\v 23 Sha'ul and Yehonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives. In their death, they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles. They were stronger than lions.
\p
\v 24 You daughters of Yisra'el, weep over Sha'ul, who clothed you in scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
\p
\v 25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Yehonathan is slain on your high places.
\p
\v 26 I am distressed for you, my brother Yonathan. You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
\p
\v 27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
\c 2
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that David inquired of יהוה, saying, "Shall I go up into any of the cities of Yehudah?" יהוה said to him, "Go up." David said, "Where shall I go up?" He said, "To Ḥevron."
\v 2 So David went up there, and his two wives also, Aḥinoam the Yizre'elitess, and Avigayil the wife of Naval the Karmelite.
\v 3 David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They lived in the cities of Ḥevron.
\v 4 The men of Yehudah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Yehudah. They told David, saying, "The men of Yavesh Gilad were those who buried Sha'ul."
\v 5 David sent messengers to the men of Yavesh Gilad, and said to them, "Blessed are you by יהוה, that you have shown this loving-kindness to your master, even to Sha'ul, and have buried him.
\v 6 Now may יהוה show loving-kindness and truth to you. I also will reward you for this goodness, because you have done this thing.
\v 7 Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Sha'ul your master is dead, and also the house of Yehudah have anointed me king over them."
\p
\v 8 Now Avner the son of Ner, captain of Sha'ul's army, had taken Ish-Bosheth the son of Sha'ul, and brought him over to Maḥanaim;
\v 9 and he made him king over Gilad, and over the Ashurites, and over Yizre'el, and over Ephrayim, and over Benyamin, and over all Yisra'el.
\v 10 Ish-Bosheth, Sha'ul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Yisra'el, and he reigned two years. But the house of Yehudah followed David.
\v 11 The time that David was king in Ḥevron over the house of Yehudah was seven years and six new moons.
\p
\v 12 Avner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-Bosheth the son of Sha'ul, went out from Maḥanaim to Givon.
\v 13 Yoav the son of Tseruyah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Givon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
\v 14 Avner said to Yoav, "Please let the young men arise and play before us!" Yoav said, "Let them arise!"
\v 15 Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benyamin, and for Ish-Bosheth the son of Sha'ul, and twelve of the servants of David.
\v 16 They caught everyone his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Ḥelqath-Hatsurim, which is in Givon.
\v 17 The battle was very severe that day: and Avner was beaten, and the men of Yisra'el, before the servants of David.
\p
\v 18 The three sons of Tseruyah were there, Yoav, and Avishai, and Asah'el: and Asah'el was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.
\v 19 Asah'el pursued after Avner; and in going he did not turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Avner.
\v 20 Then Avner looked behind him, and said, "Is it you, Asah'el?" He answered, "It is I."
\v 21 Avner said to him, "Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armor." But Asah'el would not turn aside from following him.
\v 22 Avner said again to Asah'el, "Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Yoav your brother?"
\v 23 However he refused to turn aside. Therefore Avner with the back end of the spear struck him in the fifth rib, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. It happened, that as many as came to the place where Asah'el fell down and died stood still.
\p
\v 24 But Yoav and Avishai pursued after Avner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giaḥ by the way of the wilderness of Givon.
\v 25 The children of Benyamin gathered themselves together after Avner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.
\v 26 Then Avner called to Yoav, and said, "Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?"
\v 27 Yoav said, "As Elohim lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed his brother."
\v 28 So Yoav blew the shofar; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Yisra'el no more, neither fought they any more.
\v 29 Avner and his men went all that night through the Aravah; and they passed over the Yarden, and went through all Bithron, and came to Maḥanaim.
\p
\v 30 Yoav returned from following Avner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asah'el.
\v 31 But the servants of David had struck of Benyamin, and of Avner's men, so that three hundred sixty men died.
\v 32 They took up Asah'el, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Beth-leḥem. Yoav and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Ḥevron.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now there was long war between the house of Sha'ul and the house of David: and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Sha'ul grew weaker and weaker.
\p
\v 2 To David were sons born in Ḥevron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Aḥinoam the Yizre'elitess;
\v 3 and his second, Kileab, of Avigayil the wife of Naval the Karmelite; and the third, Avshalom the son of Ma'akah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
\v 4 and the fourth, Adoniyah the son of Ḥaggith; and the fifth, Shephatyah the son of Avital;
\v 5 and the sixth, Yithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Ḥevron.
\p
\v 6 It happened, while there was war between the house of Sha'ul and the house of David, that Avner made himself strong in the house of Sha'ul.
\v 7 Now Sha'ul had a concubine, whose name was Ritspah, the daughter of Ayah: and Ish-Bosheth said to Avner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"
\v 8 Then was Avner very angry for the words of Ish-Bosheth, and said, "Am I a dog's head that belongs to Yehudah? Today I show loving-kindness to the house of Sha'ul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with iniquity concerning this woman!
\v 9 Elohim do so to Avner, and more also, if, as יהוה has sworn to David, I do not do even so to him;
\v 10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Sha'ul, and to set up the throne of David over Yisra'el and over Yehudah, from Dan even to Beersheva."
\v 11 He could not answer Avner another word, because he feared him.
\p
\v 12 Avner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, "Whose is the land?" and saying, "Cut your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring all Yisra'el around to you."
\v 13 He said, "Good; I will cut a covenant with you; but one thing I require of you. That is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Mikhal, Sha'ul's daughter, when you come to see my face."
\v 14 David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth, Sha'ul's son, saying, "Deliver me my wife Mikhal, whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
\v 15 Ish-Bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Palti'el the son of Laish.
\v 16 Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Avner said to him, "Go! Return!" and he returned.
\p
\v 17 Avner had communication with the elders of Yisra'el, saying, "In times past, you sought for David to be king over you.
\v 18 Now then do it; for יהוה has spoken of David, saying, 'By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Yisra'el out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.'"
\v 19 Avner also spoke in the ears of Benyamin: and Avner went also to speak in the ears of David in Ḥevron all that seemed good to Yisra'el, and to the whole house of Benyamin.
\p
\v 20 So Avner came to David to Ḥevron, and twenty men with him. David made Avner and the men who were with him a banquet.
\v 21 Avner said to David, "I will arise and go, and will gather all Yisra'el to my master the king, that they may cut a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your being desires." David sent Avner away; and he went in peace.
\p
\v 22 Behold, the servants of David and Yoav came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Avner was not with David in Ḥevron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
\v 23 When Yoav and all the army who was with him had come, they told Yoav, saying, Avner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
\v 24 Then Yoav came to the king, and said, "What have you done? Behold, Avner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?
\v 25 You know Avner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do."
\p
\v 26 When Yoav had come out from David, he sent messengers after Avner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it.
\v 27 When Avner was returned to Ḥevron, Yoav took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the fifth rib, so that he died, for the blood of Asah'el his brother.
\v 28 Afterward, when David heard it, he said, "I and my kingdom are guiltless before יהוה forever of the blood of Avner the son of Ner.
\v 29 Let it fall on the head of Yoav, and on all his father's house. Let there not be cut off from the house of Yoav one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread."
\v 30 So Yoav and Avishai his brother killed Avner, because he had killed their brother Asah'el at Givon in the battle.
\p
\v 31 David said to Yoav, and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, and clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Avner. And King David followed the death bed.
\v 32 They buried Avner in Ḥevron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Avner; and all the people wept.
\p
\v 33 The king lamented for Avner, and said, "Should Avner die as a fool dies?
\v 34 Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of unrighteousness, so you fell." All the people wept again over him.
\p
\v 35 All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, "Elohim do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun goes down."
\v 36 All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.
\v 37 So all the people and all Yisra'el understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Avner the son of Ner.
\v 38 The king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man have fallen today in Yisra'el?
\v 39 I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Tseruyah are too hard for me. May יהוה reward the evildoer according to his wickedness."
\c 4
\p
\v 1 When Sha'ul's son, heard that Avner was dead in Ḥevron, his hands became feeble, and all the Yisra'elites were troubled.
\v 2 Sha'ul's son, had two men who were captains of bands: the name of the one was Ba'anah, and the name of the other Rekhav, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benyamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benyamin:
\v 3 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as strangers there until this day).
\p
\v 4 Now Yehonathan, Sha'ul's son, had a son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Sha'ul and Yehonathan out of Yizre'el; and his faithful nurse took him up, and fled: and it came about, as she hurried to flee, that he fell and became lame. His name was Mephivosheth.
\p
\v 5 The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rekhav and Ba'anah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-Bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.
\v 6 They came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the fifth rib: and Rekhav and Ba'anah his brother escaped.
\v 7 Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Aravah all night.
\v 8 They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David to Ḥevron, and said to the king, "Behold, the head of Ish-Bosheth, the son of Sha'ul, your enemy, who sought your being! יהוה has avenged my master the king of Sha'ul today, and of his seed."
\p
\v 9 David answered Rekhav and Ba'anah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, "As יהוה lives, who has redeemed my being out of all adversity,
\v 10 when someone told me, 'Behold, Sha'ul is dead,' thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Tsiqlag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.
\v 11 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his own bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"
\v 12 David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Ḥevron. But they took the head of Ish-Bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Avner in Ḥevron.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Then came all the tribes of Yisra'el to David to Ḥevron, and spoke, saying, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\v 2 In times past, when Sha'ul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Yisra'el. יהוה said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of My people Yisra'el, and you shall be prince over Yisra'el.'"
\v 3 So all the elders of Yisra'el came to the king to Ḥevron; and King David cut a covenant with them in Ḥevron before יהוה; and they anointed David king over Yisra'el.
\v 4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
\v 5 In Ḥevron he reigned over Yehudah seven years and six new moons; and in Yerushalayim he reigned thirty-three years over all Yisra'el and Yehudah.
\p
\v 6 The king and his men went to Yerushalayim against the Yevusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, "Unless you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here;" thinking, "David cannot come in here."
\v 7 Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Tsion; the same is the city of David.
\v 8 David said on that day, "Whoever strikes the Yevusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and strike the lame and the blind, who are hated by David's being." Therefore they say, "The blind and the lame cannot come into the house."
\v 9 David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. David built around from Millo and inward.
\v 10 David grew greater and greater; for יהוה, Elohim Tsevaot, was with him.
\p
\v 11 Ḥiram king of Tsor sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.
\v 12 David perceived that יהוה had established him king over Yisra'el, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Yisra'el's sake.
\p
\v 13 David took him more concubines and wives out of Yerushalayim, after he was come from Ḥevron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
\v 14 These are the names of those who were born to him in Yerushalayim: Shammua, and Shovav, and Nathan, and Shelomoh,
\v 15 and Yivḥar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Yaphia,
\v 16 and Elishama, and Elyada, and Eliphelet.
\p
\v 17 When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Yisra'el, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
\v 18 Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 19 David inquired of יהוה, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?" יהוה said to David, "Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand."
\v 20 David came to Ba'al Peratsim, and David struck them there; and he said, "יהוה has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters." Therefore he called the name of that place Ba'al-Peratsim.
\v 21 They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.
\p
\v 22 The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 23 When David inquired of יהוה, He said, "You shall not go up. Circle around behind them, and attack them over against the mulberry trees.
\v 24 It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall stir yourself up; for then יהוה has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines."
\v 25 David did so, as יהוה commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geva until you come to Gezer.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 David again gathered together all the chosen men of Yisra'el, thirty thousand.
\v 2 David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Ba'ale-Yehudah, to bring up from there the ark of Elohim, which is called by the Name, even the Name of יהוה Tsevaot who sits above the keruvim.
\v 3 They set the ark of Elohim on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Avinadav that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Aḥyo, the sons of Avinadav, drove the new cart.
\v 4 They brought it out of the house of Avinadav, which was in the hill, with the ark of Elohim: and Aḥyo went before the ark.
\p
\v 5 David and all the house of Yisra'el played before יהוה with all kinds of instruments made of fir wood, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with castanets, and with cymbals.
\p
\v 6 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of Elohim, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled.
\v 7 The anger of יהוה was kindled against Uzzah; and Elohim struck him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of Elohim.
\v 8 David was displeased, because יהוה had broken forth on Uzzah; and he called that place Perets Uzzah, to this day.
\v 9 David was afraid of יהוה that day; and he said, "How shall the ark of יהוה come to me?"
\v 10 So David would not move the ark of יהוה to be with him in the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Oved-Edom the Gittite.
\v 11 The ark of יהוה remained in the house of Oved-Edom the Gittite three new moons: and יהוה blessed Oved-Edom, and all his house.
\p
\v 12 It was told King David, saying, "יהוה has blessed the house of Oved-Edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of Elohim." David went and brought up the ark of Elohim from the house of Oved-Edom into the city of David with joy.
\v 13 It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of יהוה had gone six paces, he slaughtered an ox and a fattened calf.
\v 14 David danced before יהוה with all his might; and David was clothed in a linen ephod.
\v 15 So David and all the house of Yisra'el brought up the ark of יהוה with shouting, and with the voice of the shofar.
\p
\v 16 It was so, as the ark of יהוה came into the city of David, that Mikhal the daughter of Sha'ul looked out at the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before יהוה; and she despised him in her heart.
\p
\v 17 They brought in the ark of יהוה, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered ascension offerings and peace offerings before יהוה.
\v 18 When David finished offering the ascension offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the Name of יהוה Tsevaot.
\v 19 He dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Yisra'el, both to men and women, to everyone a cake of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed everyone to his house.
\p
\v 20 Then David returned to bless his household. Mikhal the daughter of Sha'ul came out to meet David, and said, "How glorious the king of Yisra'el was today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"
\v 21 David said to Mikhal, "It was before יהוה, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of יהוה, over Yisra'el. Therefore will I celebrate before יהוה.
\v 22 I will be yet more vile than this, and will be lowly in my own sight. But of the handmaids of whom you have spoken, they shall honor me."
\v 23 Therefore Mikhal the daughter of Sha'ul had no child to the day of her death.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 It happened, when the king lived in his house, and יהוה had given him rest from all his enemies all around,
\v 2 that the king said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of Elohim dwells within curtains."
\v 3 Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that is in your heart; for יהוה is with you."
\p
\v 4 It happened the same night, that the word of יהוה came to Nathan, saying,
\v 5 "Go and tell My servant David, 'Thus says יהוה, "Shall you build Me a house for Me to dwell in?
\v 6 For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Yisra'el out of Mitsrayim, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a Tabernacle.
\v 7 In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Yisra'el, did I say a word to any of the tribes of Yisra'el, whom I commanded to be shepherd of My people Yisra'el, saying, 'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?'"'
\p
\v 8 Now therefore you shall tell my servant David this, 'Thus says יהוה Tsevaot, "I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over My people, over Yisra'el.
\v 9 I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
\v 10 I will appoint a place for My people Yisra'el, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of unrighteousness afflict them any more, as at the first,
\v 11 and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Yisra'el. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover יהוה tells you that יהוה will make you a house.
\v 12 When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out of your gut, and I will establish his kingdom.
\v 13 He shall build a house for My Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
\v 14 I will be his father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of man;
\v 15 but My loving-kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Sha'ul, whom I put away before you.
\v 16 Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be firm forever."'"
\v 17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
\p
\v 18 Then David the king went in, and sat before יהוה; and he said, "Who am I, Adonai יהוה, and what is my house, that You have brought me thus far?
\v 19 This was yet a small thing in Your eyes, Adonai יהוה; but You have spoken also of Your servant's house for a great while to come; and this after the way of men, Adonai יהוה!
\v 20 What more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, Adonai יהוה.
\v 21 For Your word's sake, and according to Your own heart, You have worked all this greatness, to make Your servant know it.
\v 22 Therefore You are great, Adonai יהוה. For there is none like You, neither is there any elohim besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\v 23 What one nation in the earth is like Your people, even like Yisra'el, whom Elohim went to redeem to Himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for You, and awesome things for Your land, before Your people, whom You redeem to You out of Mitsrayim, from the nations and their elohim?
\v 24 You established for Yourself Your people Yisra'el to be a people to You forever; and You, יהוה, became their Elohim.
\v 25 Now, יהוה Elohim, the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as You have spoken.
\v 26 Let Your Name be magnified forever, saying, 'יהוה Tsevaot is Elohim over Yisra'el; and the house of Your servant David shall be established before You.'
\v 27 For You, יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, have revealed to Your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house.' Therefore Your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to You.
\v 28 Now, O Adonai יהוה, You are Elohim, and Your words are truth, and You have promised this good thing to Your servant.
\v 29 Now therefore let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You; for You, Adonai יהוה, have spoken it. Let the house of Your servant be blessed forever with Your blessing."

\p
\v 1 After this it happened that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 2 He struck Moav, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moavites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
\p
\v 3 David struck also Hadadezer the son of Reḥov, king of Tsovah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River [Perath].
\v 4 David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.
\v 5 When the Arameans of Dammeseq came to help Hadadezer king of Tsovah, David struck of the Arameans two and twenty thousand men.
\v 6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Dammeseq; and the Arameans became servants to David, and brought tribute. יהוה gave victory to David wherever he went.
\v 7 David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Yerushalayim.
\v 8 From Betaḥ and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took exceedingly vast amounts of copper.
\p
\v 9 When Toi king of Ḥamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer,
\v 10 then Toi sent Yoram his son to King David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. Yoram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of copper:
\v 11 These also did King David dedicate to יהוה, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;
\v 12 of Aram, and of Moav, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amaleq, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Reḥov, king of Tsovah.
\p
\v 13 David earned a reputation when he returned from smiting the Arameans in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.
\v 14 He put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. יהוה gave victory to David wherever he went.
\v 15 David reigned over all Yisra'el; and David executed judgment and righteousness to all his people.
\v 16 Yoav the son of Tseruyah was over the army; and Yehoshaphat the son of Aḥilud was recorder;
\v 17 and Tsadoq the son of Aḥituv, and Aḥimelekh the son of Evyathar, were priests; and Serayah was scribe;
\v 18 and Benayah the son of Yehoyada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 David said, "Is there yet any who is left of the house of Sha'ul, that I may show him loving-kindness for Yehonathan's sake?"
\v 2 There was of the house of Sha'ul a servant whose name was Tsiva, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, "Are you Tsiva?" He said, "Your servant is he."
\v 3 The king said, "Is there not yet any of the house of Sha'ul, that I may show the loving-kindness of Elohim to him?" Tsiva said to the king, "Yehonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet."
\v 4 The king said to him, "Where is he?" Tsiva said to the king, "Behold, he is in the house of Makir the son of Ammi'el, in Lo Debar."
\v 5 Then King David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Makir the son of Ammi'el, from Lo Debar.
\v 6 Mephivosheth, the son of Yehonathan, the son of Sha'ul, came to David, and fell on his face, and bowed down. David said, "Mephivosheth." He answered, "Behold, your servant!"
\v 7 David said to him, "Do not be afraid of him; for I will surely show you loving-kindness for Yehonathan your father's sake, and will restore to you all the land of Sha'ul your father. You shall eat bread at my table continually."
\v 8 He bowed down, and said, "What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?"
\p
\v 9 Then the king called to Tsiva, Sha'ul's servant, and said to him, "All that pertained to Sha'ul and to all his house have I given to your master's son.
\v 10 You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in the fruits, that your master's son may have bread to eat: but Mephivosheth your master's son shall eat bread always at my table." Now Tsiva had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
\v 11 Then Tsiva said to the king, "According to all that my master the king commands his servant, so your shall servant do." So Mephivosheth ate at the king's table, like one of the king's sons.
\v 12 Mephivosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Tsiva were servants to Mephivosheth.
\v 13 So Mephivosheth lived in Yerushalayim; for he ate continually at the king's table. He was lame in both his feet.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Ḥanun his son reigned in his place.
\v 2 David said, "I will show loving-kindness to Ḥanun the son of Naḥash, as his father showed loving-kindness to me." So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
\v 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Ḥanun their master, "Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
\v 4 So Ḥanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
\v 5 When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, "Wait at Yeriḥo until your beards have grown, and then return."
\p
\v 6 When the children of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth Reḥov, and the Arameans of Tsovah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Ma'akah with one thousand men, and the men of Tov twelve thousand men.
\v 7 When David heard of it, he sent Yoav, and all the army of the mighty men.
\v 8 The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Arameans of Tsovah and of Reḥov, and the men of Tov and Ma'akah, were by themselves in the field.
\p
\v 9 Now when Yoav saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Yisra'el, and put them in array against the Arameans:
\v 10 The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Avishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
\v 11 He said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
\v 12 Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our Elohim; and יהוה do that which seems good to Him."
\v 13 So Yoav and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans: and they fled before him.
\v 14 When the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before Avishai, and entered into the city. Then Yoav returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 15 When the Arameans saw that they were defeated by Yisra'el, they gathered themselves together.
\v 16 Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shovak the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
\v 17 It was told David; and he gathered all Yisra'el together, and passed over the Yarden, and came to Ḥelam. The Arameans set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
\v 18 The Arameans fled before Yisra'el; and David killed of the Arameans the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shovak the captain of their army, so that he died there.
\v 19 When all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Yisra'el, they made peace with Yisra'el, and served them. So the Arameans feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Yoav, and his servants with him, and all Yisra'el; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 2 It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.
\v 3 David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, "Is this not Bathsheva, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriyah the Ḥittite?"
\v 4 David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her, for she was purified from her uncleanness; and she returned to her house.
\v 5 The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, "I am with child."
\p
\v 6 David sent to Yoav, saying, "Send me Uriyah the Ḥittite." Yoav sent Uriyah to David.
\v 7 When Uriyah was come to him, David asked of him how Yoav did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
\v 8 David said to Uriyah, "Go down to your house, and wash your feet." Uriyah departed out of the king's house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.
\v 9 But Uriyah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his master, and did not go down to his house.
\v 10 When they had told David, saying, "Uriyah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriyah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"
\v 11 Uriyah said to David, "The ark, Yisra'el, and Yehudah, are staying in sukkot; and my master Yoav, and the servants of my master, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your being lives, I will not do this thing!"
\v 12 David said to Uriyah, "Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart." So Uriyah stayed in Yerushalayim that day, and the next day.
\v 13 When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his master, but did not go down to his house.
\p
\v 14 It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Yoav, and sent it by the hand of Uriyah.
\v 15 He wrote in the letter, saying, "Send Uriyah to the forefront of the fiercest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die."
\v 16 It happened, when Yoav kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriyah to the place where he knew that men of valor were.
\v 17 The men of the city went out, and fought with Yoav. Some of the people fell, even of the servants of David; and Uriyah the Ḥittite died also.
\v 18 Then Yoav sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
\v 19 and he commanded the messenger, saying, "When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,
\v 20 it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he asks you, 'Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?
\v 21 who struck Avimelekh the son of Yerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thevets? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriyah the Ḥittite is dead also.'"
\p
\v 22 So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Yoav had sent him for.
\v 23 The messenger said to David, "The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.
\v 24 The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriyah the Ḥittite is dead also."
\v 25 Then David said to the messenger, "Thus you shall tell Yoav, 'Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.' Strengthen him."
\p
\v 26 When the wife of Uriyah heard that Uriyah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.
\v 27 When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was displeasing in the sight of יהוה.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 יהוה sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, "There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
\v 2 The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
\v 3 but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter.
\v 4 A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to him."
\p
\v 5 David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As יהוה lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die!
\v 6 He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!"
\p
\v 7 Nathan said to David, "You are the man. This is what יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'I anointed you king over Yisra'el, and I delivered you out of the hand of Sha'ul.
\v 8 I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Yisra'el and of Yehudah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.
\v 9 Why have you despised the word of יהוה, to do that which is evil in his eyes? You have struck Uriyah the Ḥittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
\v 10 Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriyah the Ḥittite to be your wife.'
\v 11 This is what יהוה says: 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
\v 12 For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Yisra'el, and before the sun.'"
\p
\v 13 David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against יהוה." Nathan said to David, "יהוה also has put away your sin. You will not die.
\v 14 However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of יהוה to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die."
\v 15 Nathan departed to his house. יהוה struck the child that Uriyah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.
\v 16 David therefore begged Elohim for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.
\v 17 The elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
\v 18 It happened on the seventh day that the child died. The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, "Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?"
\v 19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, "Is the child dead?" They said, "He is dead."
\v 20 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into the house of יהוה, and bowed down; then he came to his own house. And when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.
\p
\v 21 Then his servants said to him, "What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread."
\v 22 He said, "While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows whether יהוה will not favor me, that the child may live?'
\v 23 But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."
\p
\v 24 David comforted Bathsheva his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She brought forth a son, and he called his name Shelomoh. יהוה loved him;
\v 25 and He sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named him Yedidyah, because of יהוה.
\p
\v 26 Now Yoav fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
\v 27 Yoav sent messengers to David, and said, "I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters.
\v 28 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name."
\v 29 David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
\v 30 He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David's head. He brought forth the spoil of the city, which was exceedingly vast.
\v 31 He brought forth the people who were therein, and put them under saws, and under iron picks, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln: and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Yerushalayim.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that Avshalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
\v 2 Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.
\v 3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Yonadav, the son of Shimah, David's brother; and Yonadav was a very subtle man.
\v 4 He said to him, "Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Will you not tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I love Tamar, my brother Avshalom's sister."
\v 5 Yonadav said to him, "Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.'"
\v 6 So Amnon lay down and feigned sickness. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."
\p
\v 7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, "Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and prepare food for him."
\v 8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his eyes, and cooked the cakes.
\v 9 She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, "Have all men leave me." Every man went out from him.
\v 10 Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand." Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.
\v 11 When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister!"
\v 12 She answered him, "No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Yisra'el. Do not do this senseless thing.
\v 13 I, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Yisra'el. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you."
\v 14 However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, defiling her, and lay with her.
\p
\v 15 Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, "Arise, be gone!"
\v 16 She said to him, "Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!" But he would not listen to her.
\v 17 Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, "Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her."
\v 18 She had a varicolored tunic on her; for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
\v 19 Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her varicolored tunic that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
\p
\v 20 Avshalom her brother said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this thing to heart." So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Avshalom's house.
\v 21 But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
\v 22 Avshalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Avshalom hated Amnon, because he had defiled his sister Tamar.
\p
\v 23 It happened after two full years, that Avshalom had sheepshearers in Ba'al Ḥatsor, which is beside Ephrayim: and Avshalom invited all the king's sons.
\p
\v 24 Avshalom came to the king, and said, "See now, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant."
\v 25 The king said to Avshalom, "No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you." He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.
\v 26 Then Avshalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us." The king said to him, "Why should he go with you?"
\v 27 But Avshalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
\p
\v 28 Avshalom commanded his servants, saying, "Mark now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be strengthened, and be valiant!"
\v 29 The servants of Avshalom did to Amnon as Avshalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled.
\p
\v 30 It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, "Avshalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left!"
\v 31 Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
\v 32 Yonadav, the son of Shimah, David's brother, answered, "Do not let my master suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Avshalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
\v 33 Now therefore do not let my master the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead."
\p
\v 34 But Avshalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.
\v 35 Yonadav said to the king, "Behold, the king's sons are coming! It is as your servant said."
\v 36 It happened, as soon as he had finished speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.
\v 37 But Avshalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammiḥud, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.
\v 38 So Avshalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
\v 39 King David longed to go forth to Avshalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Now Yoav the son of Tseruyah perceived that the king's heart was toward Avshalom.
\v 2 Yoav sent to Teqoa, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, "Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead.
\v 3 Go in to the king, and speak like this to him." So Yoav put the words in her mouth.
\p
\v 4 When the woman of Teqoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and bowed down, and said, "Help, O king!"
\v 5 The king said to her, "What ails you?" She answered, "Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
\v 6 Your handmaid had two sons, and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him.
\v 7 Behold, the whole family has risen against your handmaid, and they say, 'Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the being of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.' Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth."
\p
\v 8 The king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you."
\v 9 The woman of Teqoa said to the king, "My master, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless."
\v 10 The king said, "Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more."
\v 11 Then she said, "Please let the king remember יהוה your Elohim, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son." He said, "As יהוה lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth."
\p
\v 12 Then the woman said, "Please let your handmaid speak a word to my master the king." He said, "Say on."
\v 13 The woman said, "Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of Elohim? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one.
\v 14 For we must die, and are as water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does Elohim take away the being, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from Him.
\v 15 Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my master the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, 'I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.'
\v 16 For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of Elohim.
\v 17 Then your handmaid said, 'Please let the word of my master the king bring rest; for as a messenger of Elohim, so is my master the king to discern good and bad. May יהוה, your Elohim, be with you.'"
\p
\v 18 Then the king answered the woman, "Please do not hide anything from me that I ask you." The woman said, "Let my master the king now speak."
\v 19 The king said, "Is the hand of Yoav with you in all this?" The woman answered, "As your being lives, my master the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my master the king has spoken; for your servant Yoav, he urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid;
\v 20 to change the face of the matter has your servant Yoav done this thing. My master is wise, according to the wisdom of a messenger of Elohim, to know all things that are in the earth."
\p
\v 21 The king said to Yoav, "Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring the young man Avshalom back."
\v 22 Yoav fell to the ground on his face, and bowed down, and blessed the king. Yoav said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my master, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant."
\v 23 So Yoav arose and went to Geshur, and brought Avshalom to Yerushalayim.
\v 24 The king said, "Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face." So Avshalom returned to his own house, and did not see the king's face.
\p
\v 25 Now in all Yisra'el there was none to be so much praised as Avshalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
\v 26 When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred sheqels, after the king's weight.
\v 27 To Avshalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful appearance.
\p
\v 28 Avshalom lived two full years in Yerushalayim; and he did not see the king's face.
\v 29 Then Avshalom sent for Yoav, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
\v 30 Therefore he said to his servants, "Behold, Yoav's field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire." Avshalom's servants set the field on fire. [Then the servants of Yoav came to him with their clothes torn and said, "The servants of Yoav set the field on fire."]
\v 31 Then Yoav arose, and came to Avshalom to his house, and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
\v 32 Avshalom answered Yoav, "Behold, I sent to you, saying, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me."'"
\v 33 So Yoav came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Avshalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Avshalom.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that Avshalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
\v 2 Avshalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. It was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Avshalom called to him, and said, "What city are you from?" He said, "Your servant is of one of the tribes of Yisra'el."
\v 3 Avshalom said to him, "Behold, your words are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you."
\v 4 Avshalom said moreover, "Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or judgment might come to me, and I would declare him right!"
\v 5 It was so, that when any man came near to bow down, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
\v 6 Avshalom did this sort of thing to all Yisra'el who came to the king for judgment. So Avshalom stole the hearts of the men of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 7 It happened at the end of four years, that Avshalom said to the king, "Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to יהוה, in Ḥevron.
\v 8 For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Aram, saying, 'If יהוה shall indeed bring me again to Yerushalayim, then I will serve יהוה."
\v 9 The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he arose, and went to Ḥevron.
\v 10 But Avshalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Yisra'el, saying, "As soon as you hear the voice of the shofar, then you shall say, 'Avshalom is king in Ḥevron!'"
\v 11 Two hundred men went with Avshalom out of Yerushalayim, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they did not know anything.
\v 12 Avshalom sent for Aḥithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was slaughtering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Avshalom.
\p
\v 13 A messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Yisra'el are after Avshalom."
\v 14 David said to all his servants who were with him at Yerushalayim, "Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Avshalom. Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."
\v 15 The king's servants said to the king, "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my master the king chooses."
\v 16 The king went forth, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to guard the house.
\v 17 The king went forth, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak.
\v 18 All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Kerethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
\p
\v 19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your own place.
\v 20 Whereas you came but yesterday, should I make you go up and down with us today, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Loving-kindness and truth be with you."
\v 21 Ittai answered the king, and said, "As יהוה lives, and as my master the king lives, surely in what place my master the king shall is, whether for death or for life, even there also will your servant be."
\v 22 David said to Ittai, "Go and pass over." Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him.
\v 23 All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the wadi Qidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
\p
\v 24 Behold, Tsadoq also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of Elohim; and they set down the ark of Elohim; and Evyathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city.
\v 25 The king said to Tsadoq, "Carry back the ark of Elohim into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of יהוה, He will bring me again, and show me both it, and His habitation;
\v 26 but if He say thus, 'I have no delight in you;' behold, here am I. Let Him do to me as seems good to Him."
\v 27 The king said also to Tsadoq the priest, "Are you not a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Aḥima'ats your son, and Yehonathan the son of Evyathar.
\v 28 Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me."
\v 29 Tsadoq therefore and Evyathar carried the ark of Elohim again to Yerushalayim; and they stayed there.
\p
\v 30 David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
\v 31 Someone told David, saying, "Aḥithophel is among the conspirators with Avshalom." David said, "יהוה, please turn the counsel of Aḥithophel into foolishness."
\p
\v 32 It happened that when David had come to the top, where Elohim was bowed down to, behold, Ḥushai the Arkite came to meet him with his tunic torn, and dirt on his head.
\v 33 David said to him, "If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;
\v 34 but if you return to the city, and tell Avshalom, 'I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father's servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Aḥithophel.'
\v 35 Do you not have Tsadoq and Evyathar the priests there with you? Therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Tsadoq and Evyathar the priests.
\v 36 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Aḥima'ats, Tsadoq's son, and Yehonathan, Evyathar's son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear."
\v 37 So Ḥushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Avshalom came into Yerushalayim.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 When David was a little past the top of the Mount, behold, Tsiva the servant of Mephivosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
\v 2 The king said to Tsiva, "What do you mean by these?" Tsiva said, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink."
\v 3 The king said, "Where is your master's son?" Tsiva said to the king, "Behold, he is staying in Yerushalayim; for he said, 'Today the house of Yisra'el will restore me the kingdom of my father.'"
\v 4 Then the king said to Tsiva, "Behold, all that pertains to Mephivosheth is yours." Tsiva said, "I bow down. Let me find favor in your eyes, my master, O king."
\p
\v 5 When King David came to Baḥurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Sha'ul came out, whose name was Shimi, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as he came.
\v 6 He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of King David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
\v 7 Shimi said when he cursed, "Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, worthless man!
\v 8 יהוה has returned on you all the blood of the house of Sha'ul, in whose place you have reigned! יהוה has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Avshalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!"
\p
\v 9 Then Avishai the son of Tseruyah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my master the king? Please let me go over and take off his head."
\v 10 The king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Tseruyah? Because he curses, and because יהוה has said to him, 'Curse David;' who then shall say, 'Why have you done so?'"
\v 11 David said to Avishai, and to all his servants, "Behold, my son, who came forth from my gut, seeks my being. How much more this Benyamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for יהוה has invited him.
\v 12 It may be that יהוה will look on the iniquity done to me, and that יהוה will repay me good for the cursing of me today."
\v 13 So David and his men went by the way; and Shimi went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust.
\v 14 The king, and all the people who were with him, became weary; and they refreshed themselves there.
\p
\v 15 Avshalom, and all the people, the men of Yisra'el, came to Yerushalayim, and Aḥithophel with him.
\v 16 It happened, when Ḥushai the Arkite, David's friend, had come to Avshalom, that Ḥushai said to Avshalom, "Let the king live! Let the king live!"
\v 17 Avshalom said to Ḥushai, "Is this your loving-kindness to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?"
\v 18 Ḥushai said to Avshalom, "No; but whoever יהוה, and this people, and all the men of Yisra'el have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will stay.
\v 19 Again, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence."
\p
\v 20 Then Avshalom said to Aḥithophel, "Give your counsel what we shall do."
\v 21 Aḥithophel said to Avshalom, "Go in to your father's concubines that he has left to guard the house. Then all Yisra'el will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong."
\v 22 So they spread Avshalom a tent on the top of the house; and Avshalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Yisra'el.
\v 23 The counsel of Aḥithophel, which he gave in those days, was thought of as if a man inquired of the word of Elohim: so was all the counsel of Aḥithophel both with David and with Avshalom.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Moreover Aḥithophel said to Avshalom, "Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight.
\v 2 I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him shall flee. I will strike the king only;
\v 3 and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace."
\v 4 The saying pleased Avshalom well, and all the elders of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 5 Then Avshalom said, "Now call Ḥushai the Arkite also, and let us hear likewise what he says."
\v 6 When Ḥushai was come to Avshalom, Avshalom spoke to him, saying, "Aḥithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up."
\v 7 Ḥushai said to Avshalom, "The counsel that Aḥithophel has given this time is not good."
\v 8 Ḥushai said moreover, "You know your father and his men are mighty men, and they are fierce in their being, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
\v 9 Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, 'There is a slaughter among the people who follow Avshalom!'
\v 10 Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Yisra'el knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.
\v 11 But I counsel that all Yisra'el be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheva, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.
\v 12 So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.
\v 13 Moreover, if he has gone into a city, then shall all Yisra'el bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the wadi, until there is not one small stone found there."
\v 14 Avshalom and all the men of Yisra'el said, "The counsel of Ḥushai the Arkite is better than the counsel of Aḥithophel." For יהוה had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Aḥithophel, to the intent that יהוה might bring evil on Avshalom.
\p
\v 15 Then Ḥushai said to Tsadoq and to Evyathar the priests, "Aḥithophel counseled Avshalom and the elders of Yisra'el thus; and I have counseled thus.
\v 16 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, 'Do not lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.'"
\v 17 Now Yehonathan and Aḥima'ats were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told King David. For they might not be seen to come into the city.
\v 18 But a boy saw them, and told Avshalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Baḥurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.
\v 19 The woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread out bruised grain on it; and nothing was known.
\v 20 Avshalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, "Where are Aḥima'ats and Yehonathan?" The woman said to them, "They have gone over the brook of water." When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 21 It happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told King David; and they said to David, "Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Aḥithophel counseled against you."
\v 22 Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Yarden. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Yarden.
\p
\v 23 When Aḥithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.
\p
\v 24 Then David came to Maḥanaim. Avshalom passed over the Yarden, he and all the men of Yisra'el with him.
\v 25 Avshalom set Amasa over the army instead of Yoav. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Yithra the Yisra'elite, who went in to Avigayil the daughter of Naḥash, sister to Tseruyah, Yoav's mother.
\v 26 Yisra'el and Avshalom encamped in the land of Gilad.
\p
\v 27 It happened, when David was come to Maḥanaim, that Shovi the son of Naḥash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Makir the son of Ammi'el of Lodevar, and Barzillai the Giladite of Rogelim,
\v 28 brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched grain, and beans, and lentils, and parched vegetables,
\v 29 and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat: for they said, "The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."
\c 18
\p
\v 1 David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
\v 2 David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Yoav, and a third part under the hand of Avishai the son of Tseruyah, Yoav's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, "I will surely go forth with you myself also."
\v 3 But the people said, "You shall not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not have heart for us; neither if half of us die, will they have heart for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city."
\v 4 The king said to them, "I will do what seems best to you." The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
\v 5 The king commanded Yoav and Avishai and Ittai, saying, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Avshalom." All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Avshalom.
\p
\v 6 So the people went out into the field against Yisra'el: and the battle was in the forest of Ephrayim.
\v 7 The people of Yisra'el were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.
\v 8 For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
\v 9 Avshalom happened to meet the servants of David. Avshalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heavens and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.
\v 10 A certain man saw it, and told Yoav, and said, "Behold, I saw Avshalom hanging in an oak."
\v 11 Yoav said to the man who told him, "Behold, you saw it, and why did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash."
\v 12 The man said to Yoav, "Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still would not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our own hearing the king commanded you and Avishai and Ittai, saying, 'Guard for me the young man Avshalom.'
\v 13 Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his being – and there is no matter hidden from the king – then you yourself would have set yourself against me."
\v 14 Then Yoav said, "I am not going to wait like this with you." He took three spears in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Avshalom, while he was yet alive in the heart of the oak.
\v 15 Ten young men who bore Yoav's armor surrounded and struck Avshalom, and killed him.
\p
\v 16 Yoav blew the shofar, and the people returned from pursuing after Yisra'el; for Yoav held back the people.
\v 17 They took Avshalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Yisra'el fled everyone to his tent.
\v 18 Now Avshalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, "I have no son to keep my name in memory." He called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Avshalom's monument, to this day.
\v 19 Then Aḥima'ats the son of Tsadoq said, "Let me now run, and bear the king news, how יהוה has judged the hand of his enemies."
\v 20 Yoav said to him, "You shall not be the bearer of news today, but you shall bear news another day. But today you shall bear no news, because the king's son is dead."
\v 21 Then Yoav said to the Kushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen!" The Kushite bowed himself to Yoav, and ran.
\v 22 Then Aḥima'ats the son of Tsadoq said yet again to Yoav, "But come what may, please let me also run after the Kushite." Yoav said, "Why do you want to run, my son, since that you will have no reward for the news?"
\p
\v 23 "But come what may," he said, "I will run." He said to him, "Run!" Then Aḥima'ats ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Kushite.
\p
\v 24 Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.
\v 25 The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, "If he is alone, there is news in his mouth." He came closer and closer.
\v 26 The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter, and said, "Behold, a man running alone!" The king said, "He also brings news."
\v 27 The watchman said, "I think the running of the first one is like the running of Aḥima'ats the son of Tsadoq." The king said, "He is a good man, and comes with good news."
\p
\v 28 Aḥima'ats called, and said to the king, "All is well." He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, "Blessed is יהוה your Elohim, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my master the king!"
\v 29 The king said, "Is it well with the young man Avshalom?" Aḥima'ats answered, "When Yoav sent the king's servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was."
\v 30 The king said, "Turn aside, and stand here." He turned aside, and stood still.
\v 31 Behold, the Kushite came. The Kushite said, "News for my master the king; for יהוה has avenged you today of all those who rose up against you."
\v 32 The king said to the Kushite, "Is it well with the young man Avshalom?" The Kushite answered, "May the enemies of my master the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is."
\v 33 The king trembled, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, "My son Avshalom! My son, my son Avshalom! Oh that I had died for you, Avshalom, my son, my son!"
\c 19
\p
\v 1 It was told Yoav, "Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Avshalom."
\v 2 The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard it said that day, "The king grieves for his son."
\v 3 The people snuck into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
\v 4 The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, "My son Avshalom, Avshalom, my son, my son!"
\v 5 Yoav came into the house to the king, and said, "You have shamed the faces of all your servants today, who have saved your being today, and the beings of your sons and of your daughters, and the beings of your wives, and the beings of your concubines;
\v 6 in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared today, that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today I perceive that if Avshalom had lived, and all we had died today, then it would have pleased you well.
\v 7 Now therefore arise, go out, and speak from your heart to your servants; for I swear by יהוה, if you do not go out, not a man will stay with you this night. That would be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now."
\p
\v 8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, "Behold, the king is sitting in the gate." All the people came before the king. Now Yisra'el had fled every man to his tent.
\v 9 All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Yisra'el, saying, "The king delivered us out of the palm of our enemies, and he saved us out of the palm of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Avshalom.
\v 10 Avshalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you not speak a word of bringing the king back?"
\p
\v 11 King David sent to Tsadoq and to Evyathar the priests, saying, "Speak to the elders of Yehudah, saying, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Yisra'el has come to the king, to return him to his house.
\v 12 You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?'
\v 13 Say to Amasa, 'Are you not my bone and my flesh? Elohim do so to me, and more also, if you are not captain of the army before me continually in the room of Yoav.'"
\v 14 He bowed the heart of all the men of Yehudah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, "Return, you and all your servants."
\p
\v 15 So the king returned, and came to the Yarden. Yehudah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Yarden.
\v 16 Shimi the son of Gera, the Benyamite, who was of Baḥurim, hurried and came down with the men of Yehudah to meet King David.
\v 17 There were a thousand men of Benyamin with him, and Tsiva the servant of the house of Sha'ul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Yarden in the presence of the king.
\v 18 A ferry boat went to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought was good. Shimi the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Yarden.
\v 19 He said to the king, "Do not let my master impute iniquity to me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my master the king went out of Yerushalayim, that the king should take it to his heart.
\v 20 For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come today, the first of all the house of Yoseph to go down to meet my master the king."
\v 21 But Avishai the son of Tseruyah answered, "Shall Shimi not be put to death for this, because he cursed the anointed of יהוה?"
\v 22 David said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Tseruyah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death today in Yisra'el? For do I not know that I am king over Yisra'el today?"
\v 23 The king said to Shimi, "You shall not die." The king swore to him.
\p
\v 24 Mephivosheth the son of Sha'ul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.
\v 25 It happened, when he had come to Yerushalayim to meet the king, that the king said to him, "Why did you not go with me, Mephivosheth?"
\v 26 He answered, "My master, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, 'I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.'
\v 27 He has slandered your servant to my master the king; but my master the king is as a messenger of Elohim. Do therefore what is good in your eyes.
\v 28 For all my father's house were but dead men before my master the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?"
\v 29 The king said to him, "Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Tsiva divide the land."
\v 30 Mephivosheth said to the king, "Yes, let him take all, because my master the king has come in peace to his own house."
\v 31 Barzillai the Giladite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Yarden with the king, to conduct him over the Yarden.
\v 32 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Maḥanaim; for he was a very great man.
\v 33 The king said to Barzillai, "Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Yerushalayim."
\v 34 Barzillai said to the king, "How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Yerushalayim?
\v 35 I am eighty years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be yet a burden to my master the king?
\v 36 Your servant would but just go over the Yarden with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?
\v 37 Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Kimham; let him go over with my master the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you."
\v 38 The king answered, "Kimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you require of me, that I will do for you."
\v 39 All the people went over the Yarden, and the king went over. Then the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.
\v 40 So the king went over to Gilgal, and Kimham went over with him. All the people of Yehudah brought the king over, and also half the people of Yisra'el.
\v 41 Behold, all the men of Yisra'el came to the king, and said to the king, "Why have our brothers the men of Yehudah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Yarden, and all David's men with him?"
\v 42 All the men of Yehudah answered the men of Yisra'el, "Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's cost? Or has he given us any gift?"
\v 43 The men of Yisra'el answered the men of Yehudah, and said, "We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more claim to David than you. Why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?" The words of the men of Yehudah were fiercer than the words of the men of Yisra'el.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 There happened to be there a worthless man, whose name was Sheva, the son of Bikri, a Benyamite: and he blew the shofar, and said, "We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Yishai. Every man to his tents, Yisra'el!"
\p
\v 2 So all the men of Yisra'el went up from following David, and followed Sheva the son of Bikri; but the men of Yehudah clung to their king, from the Yarden even to Yerushalayim.
\v 3 David came to his house at Yerushalayim; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to guard the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but did not go in to them. So they were closed up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.
\v 4 Then the king said to Amasa, "Call me the men of Yehudah together within three days, and be here present."
\v 5 So Amasa went to call the men of Yehudah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
\v 6 David said to Avishai, "Now Sheva the son of Bikri will do us more harm than did Avshalom. Take your master's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and escape out of our sight."
\v 7 There went out after him Yoav's men, and the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Yerushalayim, to pursue after Sheva the son of Bikri.
\v 8 When they were at the great stone which is in Givon, Amasa came to meet them. Yoav was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
\v 9 Yoav said to Amasa, "Is it well with you, my brother?" Yoav took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
\v 10 But Amasa was not on guard against the sword that was in Yoav's hand. So he struck him with it in the fifth rib, and his guts spilled to the ground, and did not strike him again; and he died. Yoav and Avishai his brother pursued after Sheva the son of Bikri.
\v 11 There stood by him one of Yoav's young men, and said, "He who favors Yoav, and he who is for David, let him follow Yoav!"
\v 12 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
\v 13 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Yoav, to pursue after Sheva the son of Bikri.
\p
\v 14 He went through all the tribes of Yisra'el to Havel, and to Beth Ma'akah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
\v 15 They came and besieged him in Havel of Beth Ma'akah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Yoav battered the wall, to throw it down.
\v 16 Then a wise woman cried out of the city, "Hear, hear! Please say to Yoav, 'Come near here, that I may speak with you.'"
\v 17 He came near to her; and the woman said, "Are you Yoav?" He answered, "I am." Then she said to him, "Hear the words of your handmaid." He answered, "I do hear."
\v 18 Then she spoke, saying, "They were used to say in old times, 'They shall surely ask counsel at Avel;' and so they settled it.
\v 19 I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Yisra'el. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Yisra'el. Why will you swallow up the inheritance of יהוה?"
\v 20 Yoav answered, "Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
\v 21 The matter is not so. But a man of the hill country of Ephrayim, Sheva the son of Bikri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city." The woman said to Yoav, "Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall."
\v 22 Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheva the son of Bikri, and threw it out to Yoav. He blew the shofar, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Yoav returned to Yerushalayim to the king.
\p
\v 23 Now Yoav was over all the army of Yisra'el; and Benayah the son of Yehoyada was over the Kerethites and over the Pelethites;
\v 24 and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor; and Yehoshaphat the son of Aḥilud was the recorder;
\v 25 and Sheva was scribe; and Tsadoq and Evyathar were priests;
\v 26 and also Ira the Yairite was chief minister to David.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 There was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of יהוה. יהוה said, "It is for Sha'ul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Givonites."
\v 2 The king called the Givonites, and said to them (now the Givonites were not of the children of Yisra'el, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Yisra'el had sworn to them: and Sha'ul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Yisra'el and Yehudah);
\v 3 and David said to the Givonites, "What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of יהוה?"
\v 4 The Givonites said to him, "It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Sha'ul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Yisra'el." He said, "Whatever you say, that will I do for you."
\v 5 They said to the king, "The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Yisra'el,
\v 6 let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to יהוה in Givah of Sha'ul, the chosen of יהוה." The king said, "I will give them."
\v 7 But the king spared Mephivosheth, the son of Yehonathan the son of Sha'ul, because of the oath of יהוה that was between them, between David and Yehonathan the son of Sha'ul.
\v 8 But the king took the two sons of Ritspah the daughter of Ayah, whom she bore to Sha'ul, Armoni and Mephivosheth; and the five sons of Mikhal the daughter of Sha'ul, whom she bore to Adri'el the son of Barzillai the Meḥolathite.
\v 9 He delivered them into the hands of the Givonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before יהוה, and all seven of them fell together. They were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
\p
\v 10 Ritspah the daughter of Ayah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured on them from the heavens. She allowed neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night.
\v 11 It was told David what Ritspah the daughter of Ayah, the concubine of Sha'ul, had done.
\v 12 David went and took the bones of Sha'ul and the bones of Yehonathan his son from the men of Yavesh Gilad, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Sha'ul in Gilboa;
\v 13 and he brought up from there the bones of Sha'ul and the bones of Yehonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.
\v 14 They buried the bones of Sha'ul and Yehonathan his son in the country of Benyamin in Tsela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After that Elohim was entreated for the land.
\p
\v 15 The Philistines had war again with Yisra'el; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. David grew faint;
\v 16 and Yishbo-Benob, who was of the sons of the Rephaim, the weight of whose spear was three hundred sheqels of copper in weight, he being armed with a new sword, thought to have slain David.
\v 17 But Avishai the son of Tseruyah helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, "You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you do not quench the lamp of Yisra'el."
\p
\v 18 It came about after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gov: then Sibbekai the Ḥushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the Rephaim.
\v 19 There was again war with the Philistines at Gov; and Elḥanan the son of Ya'areoregim the Beth-leḥemite killed Goliath the Gittite's brother, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
\v 20 There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the Rephaim.
\v 21 When he defied Yisra'el, Yehonathan the son of Shimi, David's brother, killed him.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 These four were born to the Rephaim in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
\p
\v 22 David spoke to יהוה the words of this song in the day that יהוה delivered him out of the palm of all his enemies, and out of the palm of Sha'ul:
\v 2 and he said, "יהוה is my Rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;
\v 3 Elohim, my Rock, in Him I will take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge. My savior, You save me from violence.
\v 4 I will call on יהוה, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from my enemies.
\v 5 For the waves of death surrounded me. The wadis of worthless men made me afraid.
\v 6 The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death caught me.
\v 7 In my distress I called on יהוה. Yes, I called to my Elohim. He heard my voice out of His Temple. My cry came into His ears.
\v 8 Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of the heavens quaked and were shaken, because He was angry.
\v 9 Smoke went up out of His nostrils. Fire out of His mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it.
\v 10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under His feet.
\v 11 He rode on a keruv, and flew. Yes, He was seen on the wings of the wind.
\v 12 He made darkness to be sukkot around Himself: gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
\v 13 At the brightness before Him, coals of fire were kindled.
\v 14 יהוה thundered from the heavens. Elyon uttered His voice.
\v 15 He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.
\v 16 Then the channels of the sea appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of יהוה, at the breath of the Ruaḥ of His nostrils.
\v 17 He sent from on high and He took me. He drew me out of many waters.
\v 18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
\v 19 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but יהוה was my support.
\v 20 He also brought me out into a large place. He delivered me, because He delighted in me.
\v 21 יהוה rewarded me according to my righteousness. He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
\v 22 For I have kept the ways of יהוה, and have not wickedly departed from my Elohim.
\v 23 For all His judgments were before me. As for His statutes, I did not depart from them.
\v 24 I was also perfect toward Him. I kept myself from my iniquity.
\v 25 Therefore יהוה has rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in His eyesight.
\v 26 With the kind You will show Yourself kind. With the perfect man You will show Yourself perfect.
\v 27 With the pure You will show Yourself pure. With the crooked You will show Yourself shrewd.
\v 28 You will save the afflicted people, but Your eyes are on the haughty, that You may bring them down.
\v 29 For You are my lamp, יהוה. יהוה will light up my darkness.
\v 30 For by You, I run against a troop. By my Elohim, I leap over a wall.
\v 31 As for El, His way is perfect. The speeches of יהוה are tested. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in Him.
\v 32 For who is El, besides יהוה? Who is a rock, besides our Elohim?
\v 33 El is my strong fortress. He makes my way perfect.
\v 34 He makes His feet like hinds' feet, and sets me on my high places.
\v 35 He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of copper.
\v 36 You have also given me the shield of Your salvation. Your humility has made me great.
\v 37 You have enlarged my steps under me. My feet have not slipped.
\v 38 I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them. I did not turn again until they were consumed.
\v 39 I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they cannot arise. Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
\v 40 For You have armed me with strength for the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
\v 41 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.
\v 42 They looked, but there was none to save; even to יהוה, but He did not answer them.
\v 43 Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth. I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
\v 44 You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people. You have guarded me to be the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known will serve me.
\v 45 The foreigners will submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.
\v 46 The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out of their close places.
\v 47 יהוה lives! Blessed be my Rock! Exalted be Elohim, the Rock of my salvation,
\v 48 even the El who executes vengeance for me, who brings down peoples under me,
\v 49 who brings me away from my enemies. Yes, You lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man.
\v 50 Therefore I will give thanks to You, יהוה, among the nations and to Your Name I will sing praises.
\v 51 He gives great deliverance to His king, and shows loving-kindness to His anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore."
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Yishai says, the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the Elohim of Ya'aqov, the sweet psalmist of Yisra'el:
\v 2 "The Ruaḥ of יהוה spoke by me. His saying was on my tongue.
\v 3 The Elohim of Yisra'el said, the Rock of Yisra'el spoke to me, 'One who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of Elohim,
\v 4 shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, when the tender grass springs out of the earth, through clear shining after rain.'
\v 5 Most certainly my house is not so with El, yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure, for it is all my salvation, and all my desire, although He does not make it grow.
\v 6 But all of the worthless men shall be as thorns to be thrust away, because they cannot be taken with the hand,
\v 7 but the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear. They shall be utterly burned with fire in their place."
\v 8 These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Yosheb Basshebeth the Taḥkemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.
\v 9 After him was Elazar the son of Dodo the son of an Aḥoḥite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Yisra'el were gone away.
\v 10 He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword; and יהוה worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil.
\v 11 After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.
\v 12 But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and יהוה worked a great victory.
\v 13 Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 14 David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-leḥem.
\v 15 David longed, and said, "Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-leḥem, which is by the gate!"
\v 16 The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-leḥem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to יהוה.
\p
\v 17 He said, "Far be it from me, יהוה, that I should do this! Is it not the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.
\v 18 Avishai, the brother of Yoav, the son of Tseruyah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.
\v 19 Was not he most honorable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain: however he did not attain to the three.
\p
\v 20 Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, the son of a valiant man of Qavtse'el, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two sons of Ari'el of Moav: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
\v 21 He killed a Mitsrite, a goodly man: and the Mitsrite had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Mitsrite's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
\v 22 These things did Benayahu the son of Yehoyada, and had a name among the three mighty men.
\v 23 He was more honorable than the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. David set him over his guard.
\p
\v 24 Asah'el the brother of Yoav was one of the thirty; Elḥanan the son of Dodo of Beth-leḥem,
\v 25 Shammah the Ḥarodite, Eliqa the Ḥarodite,
\v 26 Ḥelets the Paltite, Ira the son of Iqqesh the Tekoite,
\v 27 Aviezer the Anathothite, Mevunnai the Ḥushathite,
\v 28 Tsalmon the Aḥoḥite, Maharai the Netophathite,
\v 29 Ḥeleb the son of Ba'anah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Rivai of Givah of the children of Benyamin,
\v 30 Benayahu a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the wadis of Ga'ash.
\v 31 Avialbon the Arvathite, Azmaveth the Barḥumite,
\v 32 Elyaḥba the Sha'alvonite, the sons of Yashen, Yehonathan,
\v 33 Shammah the Hararite, Aḥiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
\v 34 Eliphelet the son of Aḥasbai, the son of the Ma'akathite, Eliam the son of Aḥithophel the Gilonite,
\v 35 Ḥetsrai the Karmelite, Pa'arai the Arbite,
\v 36 Yigal the son of Nathan of Tsovah, Bani the Gadite,
\v 37 Tseleq the Ammonite, Naḥarai the Beerothite, armor bearers to Yoav the son of Tseruyah,
\v 38 Ira the Yithrite, Garev the Yithrite,
\v 39 Uriyah the Ḥittite: thirty-seven in all.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Again the anger of יהוה was kindled against Yisra'el, and He moved David against them, saying, "Go, number Yisra'el and Yehudah."
\v 2 The king said to Yoav the captain of the army, who was with him, "Now go back and forth through all the tribes of Yisra'el, from Dan even to Beersheva, and number the people, that I may know the sum of the people."
\v 3 Yoav said to the king, "Now may יהוה your Elohim add to the people, however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes of my master the king see it. But why does my master the king delight in this thing?"
\p
\v 4 Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Yoav, and against the captains of the army. Yoav and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Yisra'el.
\v 5 They passed over the Yarden, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the wadi of Gad, and to Yazer:
\v 6 then they came to Gilad, and to the land of Tahtim Ḥadeshi; and they came to Dan Ya'an, and around to Tsidon,
\v 7 and came to the stronghold of Tsor, and to all the cities of the Ḥivites, and of the Kena'anites; and they went out to the south of Yehudah, at Beersheva.
\v 8 So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Yerushalayim at the end of nine new moons and twenty days.
\v 9 Yoav gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Yisra'el eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Yehudah were five hundred thousand men.
\p
\v 10 David's heart struck him after that he had numbered the people. David said to יהוה, "I have sinned greatly in that which I have done. But now, יהוה, put away, I beg You, the iniquity of Your servant; for I have done very foolishly."
\v 11 When David rose up in the morning, the word of יהוה came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
\v 12 "Go and speak to David, 'Thus says יהוה, "I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you."'"
\v 13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, "Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three new moons before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to Him who sent me."
\v 14 David said to Gad, "I am in distress. Let us fall now into the hand of יהוה; for His compassion is great. Let me not fall into the hand of man."
\p
\v 15 So יהוה sent a pestilence on Yisra'el from the morning even to the appointed time; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheva seventy thousand men.
\v 16 When the messenger stretched out his hand toward Yerushalayim to destroy it, יהוה relented of the disaster, and said to the messenger who destroyed the people, "It is enough. Now stay your hand." The messenger of יהוה was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Yevusite.
\v 17 David spoke to יהוה when he saw the messenger who struck the people, and said, "Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let Your hand be against me, and against my father's house."
\p
\v 18 Gad came that day to David, and said to him, "Go up, build an altar to יהוה on the threshing floor of Araunah the Yevusite."
\v 19 David went up according to the saying of Gad, as יהוה commanded.
\p
\v 20 Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. Then Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
\v 21 Araunah said, "Why has my master the king come to his servant?" David said, "To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to יהוה, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people."
\p
\v 22 Araunah said to David, "Let my master the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the cattle for the ascension offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:
\v 23 all this, king, does Araunah give to the king." Araunah said to the king, "May יהוה your Elohim accept you."
\v 24 The king said to Araunah, "No; but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer ascension offerings to יהוה my Elohim which cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty sheqels of silver.
\p
\v 25 David built an altar to יהוה there, and offered ascension offerings and peace offerings. So יהוה was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Yisra'el.
