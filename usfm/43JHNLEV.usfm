\s1 The Word Became Flesh
\p
\v 1 In the beginning was the word, and the word was with Elohim, and the word was Elohim.
\v 2 The same was in the beginning with Elohim.
\v 3 All things came into being through Him. Without Him nothing has come into being, that has come to be.
\v 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
\v 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
\v 6 There came a man, having been sent from Elohim, whose name was Yoḥanan.
\v 7 The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.
\v 8 This one was not the light, but was sent that he might witness about the light.
\v 9 The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, and the world did not know Him.
\v 11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.
\v 12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of Elohim, to those believing in His Name:
\v 13 who have not been born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of Elohim.
\v 14 And the Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us. We saw His glory, glory as of an only begotten with a father, full of favor and truth.
\v 15 Yoḥanan testified about Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who is coming after me has been before me, for He was before me.'"
\v 16 From His fullness we have all received favor upon favor.
\v 17 For the Torah was given through Mosheh. Favor and truth came to be through ישוע Messiah.
\v 18 No one has seen Elohim at any time. The only begotten Elohim, being in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.
\s1 Work of Yoḥanan
\p
\v 19 This is Yoḥanan's witness, when the Yehudim sent priests and Levites from Yerushalayim to ask him, "Who are you?"
\v 20 He declared, and did not deny, but he declared, "I am not the Messiah."
\p
\v 21 They asked him, "What then? Are you Eliyahu?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the prophet?" He answered, "No."
\v 22 They said therefore to him, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
\p
\v 23 He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of יהוה,' as Yeshayahu the prophet said."
\p
\v 24 The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.
\v 25 They asked him, "Why then do you immerse, if you are not the Messiah, nor Eliyahu, nor the prophet?"
\p
\v 26 Yoḥanan answered them, "I immerse in water, but among you stands one whom you do not know.
\v 27 He is the one who comes after me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loosen."
\v 28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Yarden, where Yoḥanan was immersing.
\s1 Behold the Lamb of Elohim
\p
\v 29 The next day, he saw ישוע coming to him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of Elohim, who takes away the sin of the world!
\v 30 This is He of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who has surpassed me, for He was above me.'
\v 31 I did not know Him, but for this reason I came immersing in water: that He would be revealed to Yisra'el."
\v 32 Yoḥanan testified, saying, "I have seen the Ruaḥ descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on Him.
\v 33 I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to immerse in water, He said to me, 'On whomever you will see the Ruaḥ descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He who immerses in the Set-apart Ruaḥ.'
\v 34 I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of Elohim."
\p
\v 35 Again, the next day, Yoḥanan was standing with two of his talmidim,
\v 36 and he looked at ישוע as He walked, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of Elohim!"
\v 37 The two talmidim heard him speak, and they followed ישוע.
\v 38 ישוע turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What are you looking for?" They said to Him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, being translated, 'Teacher'), "where are you staying?"
\p
\v 39 He said to them, "Come, and see." They came and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
\v 40 One of the two who heard Yoḥanan, and followed him, was Andreas, Shimon Kepha's brother.
\v 41 He first found his own brother, Shimon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah!" (which is, being translated, Messiah).
\v 42 He brought him to ישוע. ישוע looked at him, and said, "You are Shimon the son of Yonah. You shall be called Kepha" (which is by translation, Petros).
\s1 Calling of Philippos and Nathana'el
\p
\v 43 On the next day, He was determined to go out into the Galil, and He found Philippos. ישוע said to him, "Follow Me."
\v 44 Now Philippos was from Beth-tsaida, of the city of Andreas and Kepha.
\v 45 Philippos found Nathana'el, and said to him, "We have found Him, of whom Mosheh in the Torah, and the prophets, wrote: ישוע of Nazareth, the son of Yoseph."
\p
\v 46 Nathana'el said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philippos said to him, "Come and see."
\p
\v 47 ישוע saw Nathana'el coming to Him, and said about him, "Behold, a Yisra'elite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
\p
\v 48 Nathana'el said to him, "How do You know me?" ישוע answered him, "Before Philippos called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
\p
\v 49 Nathana'el answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of Elohim! You are King of Yisra'el!"
\p
\v 50 ישוע answered him, "Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these!"
\v 51 He said to him, "Most certainly, I tell you all, you will see heaven opened, and the messengers of Elohim ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
\c 2
\s1 Wedding in Qanah
\p
\v 1 The third day, there was a wedding in Qanah of the Galil. The mother of ישוע was there.
\v 2 ישוע also was invited, with His talmidim, to the wedding.
\v 3 When the wine ran out, the mother of ישוע said to Him, "They have no wine."
\p
\v 4 ישוע said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you and Me? My hour has not yet come."
\p
\v 5 His mother said to the servants, "Whatever He says to you, do it."
\v 6 Now there were six water pots of stone set there for the purifying of the Yehudim, containing two or three metretes apiece.
\v 7 ישוע said to them, "Fill the water pots with water." They filled them up to the brim.
\v 8 He said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast." So they took it.
\v 9 When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,
\v 10 and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is inferior. You have guarded the good wine until now!"
\v 11 This beginning of His signs ישוע did in Qanah of the Galil, and revealed His glory; and His talmidim believed in Him.
\p
\v 12 After this, He went down to Kaphar-naḥum; He, and His mother, His brothers, and His talmidim; and they stayed there a few days.
\s1 Driving the Money Changers out of the Temple
\p
\v 13 The Pesaḥ of the Yehudim was at hand, and ישוע went up to Yerushalayim.
\v 14 He found in the Temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.
\v 15 He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the Temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables.
\v 16 To those who sold the doves, He said, "Take these things out of here! Do not make My Father's house a marketplace!"
\v 17 His talmidim remembered that it was written, "Zeal for Your house will consume me."
\p
\v 18 The Yehudim therefore answered Him, "What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?"
\p
\v 19 ישוע answered them, "Destroy this dwelling place, and in three days I will raise it up."
\p
\v 20 The Yehudim therefore said, "It took forty-six years to build this dwelling place! Will you raise it up in three days?"
\v 21 But He spoke of the dwelling place of His body.
\v 22 When therefore He was raised from the dead, His talmidim remembered that He said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which ישוע had said.
\p
\v 23 Now when He was in Yerushalayim at the Pesaḥ, during the Feast, many believed in His Name, observing His signs which He did.
\v 24 But ישוע did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew everyone,
\v 25 and because He did not need for anyone to witness concerning man; for He Himself knew what was in man.
\c 3
\s1 Born from Above
\p
\v 1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nikodemos, a ruler of the Yehudim.
\v 2 The same came to Him by night, and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from Elohim, for no one can do these signs that You do, unless Elohim is with him."
\p
\v 3 ישוע answered him, "Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born from above, he cannot see the Kingdom of Elohim."
\p
\v 4 Nikodemos said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"
\p
\v 5 ישוע answered, "Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Elohim.
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Ruaḥ is spirit.
\v 7 Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born from above.'
\v 8 The spirit breathes where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Ruaḥ."
\p
\v 9 Nikodemos answered Him, "How can these things be?"
\p
\v 10 ישוע answered him, "Are you the teacher of Yisra'el, and do not understand these things?
\v 11 Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you do not receive our witness.
\v 12 If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
\v 13 No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, [who is in heaven].
\v 14 As Mosheh lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
\v 15 that whoever believes in Him might have everlasting life.
\v 16 Thus, Elohim so loved the world, that He gave the only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.
\v 17 For Elohim did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.
\v 18 The one believing in Him is not judged. He who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of Elohim.
\v 19 This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.
\v 20 For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.
\v 21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in Elohim."
\s1 Yoḥanan Affirms ישוע
\p
\v 22 After these things, ישוע came with His talmidim into the land of Yehudah. He stayed there with them, and immersed.
\v 23 Yoḥanan also was immersing in Ain near Salem, because there was much water there. They came, and were immersed.
\v 24 For Yoḥanan was not yet thrown into prison.
\v 25 There arose therefore a questioning on the part of Yoḥanan's talmidim with a Yehudite about purification.
\v 26 They came to Yoḥanan, and said to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Yarden, to whom you have testified, behold, the same immerses, and everyone is coming to Him."
\p
\v 27 Yoḥanan answered, "A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given to him from heaven.
\v 28 You yourselves testify to me that I said, 'I am not the Messiah,' but, 'I have been sent before Him.'
\v 29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.
\v 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
\v 31 He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 What He has seen and heard, of that He testifies; and no one receives His witness.
\v 33 He who has received His witness has set His seal to this, that Elohim is true.
\v 34 For He whom Elohim has sent speaks the words of Elohim; for He gives the Ruaḥ without measure.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.
\v 36 The one who believes in the Son has everlasting life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of Elohim remains on him."
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore when the Master knew that the Pharisees had heard that ישוע was making and immersing more talmidim than Yoḥanan
\v 2 (although ישוע Himself was not immersing, but His talmidim were),
\v 3 He left Yehudah, and went again into the Galil.
\v 4 He needed to pass through Shom'ron.
\s1 Woman at the Well
\p
\v 5 So He came to a city of Shom'ron, called Shekhem, near the parcel of ground that Ya'aqov gave to his son, Yoseph.
\v 6 Ya'aqov's well was there. ישוע therefore, being tired from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
\v 7 A woman of Shom'ron came to draw water. ישוע said to her, "Give me a drink."
\v 8 For His talmidim had gone away into the city to buy food.
\v 9 The Shomeronite woman therefore said to him, "How is it that You, being a Yehudite, ask for a drink from me, a Shomeronite woman?" (For Yehudim have no dealings with Shomeronites).
\p
\v 10 ישוע answered her, "If you knew the gift of Elohim, and who it is who says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."
\p
\v 11 The woman said to Him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water?
\v 12 Are you greater than our father, Ya'aqov, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?"
\p
\v 13 ישוע answered her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
\v 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst to the age; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life."
\p
\v 15 The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I do not get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw."
\p
\v 16 ישוע said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."
\p
\v 17 The woman answered and said to Him, "I have no husband." ישוע said to her, "You said well, 'I have no husband,'
\v 18 for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly."
\p
\v 19 The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
\v 20 Our fathers bowed down in this mountain, and you Yehudim say that in Yerushalayim is the place where people ought to bow down."
\v 21 ישוע said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Yerushalayim, will you bow down to the Father.
\v 22 You bow down to that which you do not know. We bow down to that which we know; for salvation is from the Yehudim.
\v 23 But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will bow down before the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to bow down to Him.
\v 24 Elohim is spirit, and those who bow down to Him must bow down to Him in spirit and truth."
\p
\v 25 The woman said to him, I know that Mashiaḥ comes, He who is called Messiah. When He has come, He will declare to us all things."
\p
\v 26 ישוע said to her, "I am He, the one who speaks to you."
\v 27 At this, His talmidim came. They marveled that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, "What are you looking for?" or, "Why do you speak with her?"
\v 28 So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,
\v 29 "Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Messiah?"
\p
\v 30 They went out of the city, and were coming to Him.
\v 31 In the meanwhile, the talmidim urged Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
\p
\v 32 But He said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know about."
\p
\v 33 The talmidim therefore said to one another, "Has anyone brought Him something to eat?"
\p
\v 34 ישוע said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to accomplish His work.
\v 35 Do you not say, 'There are yet four months until the harvest?' Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.
\v 36 He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to everlasting life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
\v 37 For in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'
\v 38 I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."
\p
\v 39 From that city many of the Shomeronites believed in Him because of the word of the woman, who testified, "He told me everything that I did."
\v 40 So when the Shomeronites came to Him, they begged Him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.
\v 41 Many more believed because of His word.
\v 42 They said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed [the Messiah,] the Savior of the world."
\p
\v 43 After the two days He went into the Galil.
\v 44 For ישוע Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in His own country.
\v 45 So when He came into the Galil, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did in Yerushalayim at the Feast, for they also went to the Feast.
\s1 Nobleman's Son Healed
\p
\v 46 ישוע came therefore again to Qanah of the Galil, where He made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Kaphar-naḥum.
\v 47 When he heard that ישוע had come out of Yehudah into the Galil, he went to Him, and begged Him that He would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
\v 48 ישוע therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe."
\p
\v 49 The nobleman said to Him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
\v 50 ישוע said to him, "Go your way. Your son lives." The man believed the word that ישוע spoke to him, and he went his way.
\v 51 As he was now going down, his bondservants met him saying his child lives.
\v 52 So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him."
\v 53 So the father knew that it was at that hour in which ישוע said to him, "Your son lives." He believed, as did his whole house.
\v 54 This is again the second sign that ישוע did, having come out of Yehudah into the Galil.
\c 5
\s1 Pool at Bethesda; Healing on the Sabbath
\p
\v 1 After these things, there was a feast of the Yehudim, and ישוע went up to Yerushalayim.
\v 2 Now in Yerushalayim by the sheep gate, there was a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda", having five porches.
\v 3 In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, [waiting for the moving of the water;
\v 4 for a messenger went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.]
\v 5 A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.
\v 6 When ישוע saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to be made well?"
\p
\v 7 The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another steps down before me."
\p
\v 8 ישוע said to him, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."
\p
\v 9 Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
\v 10 So the Yehudim said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat."
\p
\v 11 He answered them, "He who made me well, the same said to me, 'Take up your mat, and walk.'"
\p
\v 12 Then they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Take up and walk'?"
\p
\v 13 But he who was healed did not know who it was, for ישוע had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.
\p
\v 14 Afterward ישוע found him in the Temple, and said to him, "Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you."
\p
\v 15 The man went away, and told the Yehudim that it was ישוע who had made him well.
\v 16 Because of this the Yehudim persecuted ישוע, [and sought to kill Him,] because He did these things on the Sabbath.
\v 17 But ישוע answered them, "My Father is still working, so I am working, too."
\v 18 For this cause therefore the Yehudim sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also called Elohim His own Father, making Himself equal with Elohim.
\s1 The Son Does Only the Will of the Father
\p
\v 19 ישוע therefore answered them, "Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father doing. For whatever things He does, these the Son also does likewise.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does. He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel.
\v 21 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He desires.
\v 22 For the Father judges no one, but He has given all judgment to the Son,
\v 23 that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
\p
\v 24 "Most certainly I tell you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has everlasting life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
\v 25 Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of Elohim; and those who hear will live.
\v 26 For as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself.
\v 27 He also gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is a son of man.
\v 28 Do not marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear His voice,
\v 29 and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
\v 30 I can do nothing of Myself. As I hear, I judge, and My judgment is righteous; because I do not seek My own will, but the will of the One who sent Me.
\p
\v 31 "If I testify about Myself, My witness is not valid.
\v 32 It is another who testifies about Me. I know that the witness which He testifies about Me is true.
\v 33 You have sent to Yoḥanan, and he has testified to the truth.
\v 34 But the witness which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.
\v 35 He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for an hour in his light.
\v 36 But the witness which I have is greater than that of Yoḥanan, for the works which the Father gave Me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me.
\v 37 The Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified about Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.
\v 38 You do not have His word living in you; because you do not believe Him whom He sent.
\p
\v 39 "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have everlasting life; and these are they which testify about Me.
\v 40 Yet you will not come to Me, that you may have life.
\v 41 I do not receive glory from men.
\v 42 But I know you, that you do not have the love of Elohim in yourselves.
\v 43 I have come in My Father's Name, and you do not receive Me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
\v 44 How can you believe, you who receive glory from one another, and do not seek the glory that comes from the only Elohim?
\p
\v 45 "Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Mosheh, in whom you have set your hope.
\v 46 For if you believed Mosheh, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.
\v 47 But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?"
\c 6
\s1 Feeding Five Thousand
\p
\v 1 After these things, ישוע went away to the other side of the Sea of the Galil, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.
\v 2 A great crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He did on those who were sick.
\v 3 ישוע went up into the mountain, and He sat there with His talmidim.
\v 4 Now the Pesaḥ, the Feast of the Yehudim, was at hand.
\v 5 ישוע therefore lifting up His eyes, and seeing that a great crowd was coming to Him, said to Philippos, "Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?"
\v 6 This He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.
\p
\v 7 Philippos answered Him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little."
\p
\v 8 One of His talmidim, Andreas, Shimon Kepha's brother, said to Him,
\v 9 "There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?"
\p
\v 10 ישוע said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
\v 11 ישוע took the loaves; and having given thanks, He distributed to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.
\v 12 When they were filled, He said to His talmidim, "Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost."
\v 13 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.
\v 14 When therefore the people saw the sign which ישוע did, they said, "This is truly the prophet who comes into the world."
\v 15 ישוע therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take Him by force, to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself.
\s1 Walking on Water
\p
\v 16 When evening came, His talmidim went down to the sea,
\v 17 and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Kaphar-naḥum. It was now dark, and ישוע had not come to them.
\v 18 The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.
\v 19 When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw ישוע walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.
\v 20 But He said to them, "I am. Do not be afraid."
\v 21 They were willing therefore to receive Him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
\s1 Bread of Life
\p
\v 22 On the next day, the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except one, and that ישוע had not entered with His talmidim into the boat, but His talmidim had gone away alone.
\v 23 However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Master had given thanks.
\v 24 When the crowd therefore saw that ישוע was not there, nor His talmidim, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Kaphar-naḥum, seeking ישוע.
\v 25 When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, "Rabbi, when did You come here?"
\p
\v 26 ישוע answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.
\v 27 Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For Elohim the Father has sealed Him."
\p
\v 28 They said therefore to Him, "What must we do, that we may work the works of Elohim?"
\p
\v 29 ישוע answered them, "This is the work of Elohim, that you believe in Him whom He has sent."
\p
\v 30 They said therefore to Him, "What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?
\v 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, 'He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.'"
\p
\v 32 ישוע therefore said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, it was not Mosheh who gave you the bread out of heaven; but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
\v 33 For the bread of Elohim is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."
\p
\v 34 They said therefore to Him, "Master, always give us this bread."
\p
\v 35 ישוע said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me will not be hungry, and he who believes in Me will never thirst.
\v 36 But I told you that you have seen Me, and yet you do not believe.
\v 37 All those whom the Father gives Me will come to Me. He who comes to Me I will in no way throw out.
\v 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
\v 39 This is the will of the One who sent Me, that of all He has given to Me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.
\v 40 This is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in Him, should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
\p
\v 41 The Yehudim therefore grumbled concerning Him, because He said, "I am the bread which came down out of heaven."
\v 42 They said, "Is this not ישוע, the son of Yoseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does He say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'"
\p
\v 43 Therefore ישוע answered them, "Do not grumble among yourselves.
\v 44 No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by יהוה.' Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to Me.
\v 46 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from Elohim. He has seen the Father.
\v 47 Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes [in Me] has everlasting life.
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
\v 50 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.
\v 51 I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live to the age. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is My flesh."
\p
\v 52 The Yehudim therefore contended with one another, saying, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat?"
\p
\v 53 ישוע therefore said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.
\v 54 He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
\v 55 For My flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink indeed.
\v 56 He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood lives in Me, and I in him.
\v 57 As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on Me, he will also live because of Me.
\v 58 This is the bread which came down out of heaven—not as the fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live to the age."
\v 59 He said these things in the synagogue, as He taught in Kaphar-naḥum.
\p
\v 60 Therefore many of His talmidim, when they heard this, said, "This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?"
\s1 Words of Eternal Life
\p
\v 61 But ישוע knowing in Himself that His talmidim grumbled at this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?
\v 62 Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?
\v 63 It is the Ruaḥ that gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.
\v 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." For ישוע knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray Him.
\v 65 He said, "For this cause I have said to you that no one can come to Me, unless it is given to him by the Father."
\p
\v 66 At this, many of His talmidim went back, and walked no more with Him.
\v 67 ישוע said therefore to the twelve, "You do not also want to go away, do you?"
\p
\v 68 Shimon Kepha answered Him, "Master, to whom would we go? You have the words of everlasting life.
\v 69 We have come to believe and know that You are the Set-apart One of Elohim."
\p
\v 70 He answered them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
\v 71 Now he spoke of Yehudah, the son of Shimon Ish-Qerioth, for it was he who would betray Him, being one of the twelve.
\c 7
\s1 Feast of Tabernacles
\p
\v 1 After these things, ישוע was walking in the Galil, for He would not walk in Yehudah, because the Yehudim sought to kill Him.
\v 2 Now the Feast of the Yehudim, the Feast of Tabernacles, was near.
\v 3 His brothers therefore said to Him, "Depart from here, and go into Yehudah, that Your talmidim also may see Your works which You do.
\v 4 For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, reveal Yourself to the world."
\v 5 For even His brothers did not believe in Him.
\p
\v 6 ישוע therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
\v 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.
\v 8 You go up to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this Feast, because My time is not yet fulfilled."
\p
\v 9 Having said these things to them, He stayed in the Galil.
\v 10 But when His brothers had gone up to the Feast, then He also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
\v 11 The Yehudim therefore sought Him at the Feast, and said, "Where is He?"
\v 12 There was much complaining among the crowds concerning Him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "Not so, but He leads the crowd astray."
\v 13 Yet no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Yehudim.
\v 14 But when it was now the middle of the Feast, ישוע went up into the Temple and taught.
\v 15 The Yehudim therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man know letters, having never been educated?"
\p
\v 16 ישוע therefore answered them, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.
\v 17 If anyone desires to do His will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from Elohim, or if I am speaking from Myself.
\v 18 He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
\v 19 Did Mosheh not give you the Torah, and yet none of you keep the Torah? Why do you seek to kill Me?"
\p
\v 20 The crowd answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?"
\p
\v 21 ישוע answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
\v 22 Mosheh has given you circumcision (not that it is of Mosheh, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.
\v 23 If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the Torah of Mosheh may not be broken, are you angry with Me, because I made a man completely whole on the Sabbath?
\v 24 Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
\p
\v 25 Therefore some of them of Yerushalayim said, "Is this not He whom they seek to kill?
\v 26 Behold, He speaks openly, and they say nothing to Him. Can it be that the rulers truly know that this is the Messiah?
\v 27 However, we know where this man comes from, but when the Messiah comes, no one will know where He comes from."
\p
\v 28 ישוע therefore cried out in the Temple, teaching and saying, "You both know Me, and know where I am from. I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.
\v 29 I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me."
\p
\v 30 They sought therefore to take Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
\v 31 But of the crowd, many believed in Him. They said, "When the Messiah comes, He will not do more signs than those which this man has done, will He?"
\s1 Attempt to Arrest ישוע
\p
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the crowd grumbling these things concerning Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest Him.
\p
\v 33 Then ישוע said, "I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to Him who sent me.
\v 34 You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come."
\p
\v 35 The Yehudim therefore said among themselves, "Where will this man go that we will not find Him? Will He go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
\v 36 What is this word that He said, 'You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come'?"
\s1 Living Water
\p
\v 37 Now on the last and greatest day of the Feast, ישוע stood and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink!
\v 38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water."
\v 39 But He said this about the Ruaḥ, which those believing in Him were to receive. For the Ruaḥ was not yet given, because ישוע was not yet glorified.
\p
\v 40 Some of the crowd therefore, when they heard these words, said, "This is truly the prophet."
\v 41 Others said, "This is the Messiah." But some said, "What, does the Messiah come out of the Galil?
\v 42 Has the Scripture not said that the Messiah comes of the seed of David, and from Beth-leḥem, the village where David was?"
\v 43 So there arose a division in the crowd because of Him.
\v 44 Some of them would have arrested Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
\v 45 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why did you not bring Him?"
\p
\v 46 The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"
\v 47 The Pharisees therefore answered them, "You are not also led astray, are you?
\v 48 Have any of the rulers believed in Him, or of the Pharisees?
\v 49 But this crowd, which does not know the law, is accursed."
\p
\v 50 Nikodemos (he who came to Him before, being one of them) said to them,
\v 51 "Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?"
\p
\v 52 They answered him, "Are you also from the Galil? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of the Galil." [
\v 53 Everyone went to his own house.]
\c 8
\s1 [Woman Caught in Adultery]
\p
\v 1 [
\v 1 But ישוע went to the Mount of Olives.
\v 2 Now very early in the morning, He came again into the Temple, and all the people came to Him. He sat down, and taught them.
\v 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the middle,
\v 4 they told Him, "Teacher, this woman has been taken in adultery, in the very act.
\v 5 Now in the Torah, Mosheh commanded us to stone such women. What then do You say about her?"
\v 6 They said this testing Him, that they might have something to accuse Him of. But ישוע stooped down, and wrote on the ground with His finger.
\v 7 But when they continued asking Him, He looked up and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her."
\v 8 Again He stooped down, and with His finger wrote on the ground.
\v 9 They, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. ישוע was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.
\v 10 ישוע, standing up, saw her and said, "Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?"
\p
\v 11 She said, "No one, Master." ישוע said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more."]
\s1 Light of the World
\p
\v 12 Again, therefore, ישוע spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life."
\p
\v 13 The Pharisees therefore said to Him, "You testify about Yourself. Your witness is not valid."
\p
\v 14 ישוע answered them, "Even if I testify about Myself, My witness is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I came from, or where I am going.
\v 15 You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.
\v 16 Even if I do judge, My judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent Me.
\v 17 It is also written in your law that the witness of two people is valid.
\v 18 I am one who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me."
\p
\v 19 They said therefore to Him, "Where is your Father?" ישוע answered, "You know neither Me, nor My Father. If you knew Me, you would know My Father also."
\v 20 ישוע spoke these words in the treasury, as He taught in the Temple. Yet no one arrested Him, because His hour had not yet come.
\v 21 ישוע said therefore again to them, "I am going away, and you will seek Me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you cannot come."
\p
\v 22 The Yehudim therefore said, "Will He kill Himself, because He says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?"
\p
\v 23 He said to them, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.
\v 24 I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins."
\p
\v 25 They said therefore to Him, "Who are You?" ישוע said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.
\v 26 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him, these I say to the world."
\p
\v 27 They did not understand that He spoke to them about the Father.
\v 28 ישוע therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and I do nothing of Myself, but as My Father taught Me, I say these things.
\v 29 He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him."
\v 30 As He spoke these things, many believed in Him.
\s1 The Truth Will Make You Free
\p
\v 31 ישוע therefore said to those Yehudim who had believed Him, "If you remain in My word, then you are truly My talmidim.
\v 32 You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
\p
\v 33 They answered Him, "We are Avraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do You say, 'You will be made free'?"
\p
\v 34 ישוע answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.
\v 35 A bondservant does not live in the house to the age. A son remains to the age.
\v 36 If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
\v 37 I know that you are Avraham's seed, yet you seek to kill Me, because My word finds no place in you.
\v 38 I speak the things which I have seen with the Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father."
\p
\v 39 They answered Him, "Our father is Avraham." ישוע said to them, "If you were Avraham's children, you would do the works of Avraham.
\v 40 But now you seek to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from Elohim. Avraham did not do this.
\v 41 You do the works of your father." They said to him, "We were not born of whoring. We have one Father, Elohim."
\p
\v 42 Therefore ישוע said to them, "If Elohim were your father, you would love Me, for I have come forth from Elohim. For I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me.
\v 43 Why do you not understand My speech? Because you cannot hear My word.
\v 44 You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and the father of them.
\v 45 But because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me.
\v 46 Which of you convicts Me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?
\v 47 He who is of Elohim hears the words of Elohim. For this cause you do not hear, because you are not of Elohim."
\p
\v 48 Then the Yehudim answered Him, "Do we not say well that You are a Shomeronite, and have a demon?"
\p
\v 49 ישוע answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.
\v 50 But I do not seek My own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.
\v 51 Most certainly, I tell you, if a person guards My word, he will never see death to the age."
\p
\v 52 Then the Yehudim said to Him, "Now we know that You have a demon. Avraham died, and the prophets; and You say, 'If a man guards My word, he will never taste death to the age.'
\v 53 Are You greater than our father, Avraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do You make Yourself out to be?"
\s1 Before Avraham
\p
\v 54 ישוע answered, "If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing. It is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is our Elohim.
\v 55 You have not known Him, but I know Him. If I said, 'I do not know Him,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know Him, and guard His word.
\v 56 Your father Avraham rejoiced to see My day. He saw it, and was glad."
\p
\v 57 The Yehudim therefore said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Avraham?"
\p
\v 58 ישוע said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before Avraham came to be, I am."
\p
\v 59 Therefore they took up stones to throw at Him, but ישוע was hidden, and went out of the Temple, [having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by].
\c 9
\s1 Healing of a Blind Man
\p
\v 1 As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.
\v 2 His talmidim asked Him, "Rabbi, who sinned: this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
\p
\v 3 ישוע answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of Elohim might be revealed in him.
\v 4 We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
\v 5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
\v 6 When He had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud,
\v 7 and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Shiloaḥ" (which is translated "Sent"). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.
\v 8 The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was a beggar before, said, "Is this not he who sat and begged?"
\v 9 Others were saying, "It is he." Still others were saying, "No, but he is like him." He said, "I am."
\v 10 They therefore were asking him, "How were your eyes opened?"
\p
\v 11 He answered, "A man called ישוע made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to [the pool of] Shiloaḥ, and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight."
\p
\v 12 Then they asked him, "Where is He?" He said, "I do not know."
\s1 The Pharisees Investigate
\p
\v 13 They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.
\v 14 It was a Sabbath day when ישוע made the mud and opened his eyes.
\v 15 Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."
\p
\v 16 Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from Elohim, because he does not guard the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them.
\v 17 Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about Him, because He opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."
\p
\v 18 The Yehudim therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
\v 19 and asked them, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
\p
\v 20 His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
\v 21 but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself."
\v 22 His parents said these things because they feared the Yehudim; for the Yehudim had already agreed that if any man would confess Him as Messiah, he would be put out of the synagogue.
\v 23 Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."
\p
\v 24 So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, "Give glory to Elohim. We know that this man is a sinner."
\p
\v 25 He therefore answered, "I do not know if He is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see."
\p
\v 26 They said to him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?"
\p
\v 27 He answered them, "I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You do not also want to become His talmidim, do you?"
\p
\v 28 They insulted him and said, "You are His talmid, but we are talmidim of Mosheh.
\v 29 We know that Elohim has spoken to Mosheh. But as for this man, we do not know where He comes from."
\p
\v 30 The man answered them, "How amazing! You do not know where He comes from, yet He opened my eyes.
\v 31 We know that Elohim does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is an Elohim-fearer, and does His will, He listens to him.
\v 32 From the age of old it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
\v 33 If this man were not from Elohim, He could do nothing."
\p
\v 34 They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" So they threw him out.
\p
\v 35 ישוע heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, He said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
\p
\v 36 He answered, "Who is He, Master, that I may believe in Him?"
\p
\v 37 ישוע said to him, "You have both seen Him, and it is He who speaks with you."
\p
\v 38 He said, "Master, I believe!" and he bowed down to Him.
\p
\v 39 ישוע said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who do not see may see; and that those who see may become blind."
\p
\v 40 Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to Him, "Are we also blind?"
\p
\v 41 ישוע said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Your sin remains."
\c 10
\s1 Parable of the Shepherd
\p
\v 1 "Most certainly, I tell you, one who does enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
\v 2 But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
\v 3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
\v 4 Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
\v 5 They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they do not know the voice of strangers."
\v 6 ישוע spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what he was telling them.
\p
\v 7 ישוע therefore said to them again, "Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep's door.
\v 8 All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
\v 9 I am the door. If anyone enters in by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.
\v 10 The thief only comes to steal, slaughter, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
\v 11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
\v 12 He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.
\v 13 The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and does not care for the sheep.
\v 14 I am the good shepherd. I know My own, and My own know Me;
\v 15 even as the Father knows Me, and I know the Father. I lay down My life for the sheep.
\v 16 I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.
\v 17 Therefore the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life, that I may take it again.
\v 18 No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down by Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this command from My Father."
\p
\v 19 Therefore a division arose again among the Yehudim because of these words.
\v 20 Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to Him?"
\v 21 Others said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It is not possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?"
\s1 Ḥanukkah
\p
\v 22 It was the Feast of the Dedication at Yerushalayim, and it was winter.
\v 23 ישוע was walking in the Temple, in Shelomoh's porch.
\v 24 The Yehudim therefore came around Him and said to Him, "How long will You hold us in suspense? If You are the Messiah, tell us plainly."
\s1 ישוע and the Father are One
\p
\v 25 ישוע answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father's Name, these testify about Me.
\v 26 But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.
\v 27 My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.
\v 28 I give everlasting life to them. They will shall not perish to the age, and no one will snatch them out of My hand.
\v 29 What My Father has given to Me is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of My Father's hand.
\v 30 I and the Father are one."
\p
\v 31 Therefore Yehudim took up stones again to stone Him.
\v 32 ישוע answered them, "I have shown you many good works from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?"
\p
\v 33 The Yehudim answered Him, "We do not stone You for a good work, but for blasphemy: because You, being a man, make Yourself Elohim."
\p
\v 34 ישוע answered them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, you are elohim'?
\v 35 If He called them elohim, to whom the word of Elohim came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),
\v 36 do you say of Him whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Son of Elohim?'
\v 37 If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me.
\v 38 But if I do them, though you do not believe Me, believe the works; that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father."
\p
\v 39 They sought again to seize Him, and He went out of their hand.
\v 40 He went away again beyond the Yarden into the place where Yoḥanan was immersing at first, and there He stayed.
\v 41 Many came to Him. They said, "Yoḥanan indeed did no sign, but everything that Yoḥanan said about this man is true."
\v 42 Many believed in Him there.
\c 11
\s1 Death and Resurrection of Elazar
\p
\v 1 Now a certain man was sick, Elazar from Bethany, of the village of Miryam and her sister, Martha.
\v 2 It was that Miryam who had anointed the Master with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother, Elazar, was sick.
\v 3 The sisters therefore sent to Him, saying, "Master, behold, he for whom You have great affection is sick."
\v 4 But when ישוע heard it, He said, "This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of Elohim, that the Son of Elohim may be glorified by it."
\v 5 Now ישוע loved Martha, and her sister, and Elazar.
\v 6 When therefore He heard that he was sick, He stayed two days in the place where He was.
\v 7 Then after this He said to the talmidim, "Let us go into Yehudah again."
\p
\v 8 The talmidim told Him, "Rabbi, the Yehudim were just trying to stone You, and You are going there again?"
\p
\v 9 ישוע answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
\v 10 But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."
\v 11 He said these things, and after that, He said to them, "Our friend, Elazar, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep."
\p
\v 12 The talmidim therefore said to Him, "Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will be safe."
\p
\v 13 Now ישוע had spoken of his death, but they thought that He spoke of taking rest in sleep.
\v 14 So ישוע said to them plainly then, "Elazar is dead.
\v 15 I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let us go to him."
\p
\v 16 Taom therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow talmidim, "Let us go also, that we may die with him."
\p
\v 17 So when ישוע came, He found that he had been in the tomb four days already.
\v 18 Now Bethany was near Yerushalayim, about fifteen stadia away.
\v 19 Many of the Yehudim had joined Martha and Miryam, to console them concerning their brother.
\v 20 Then when Martha heard that ישוע was coming, she went and met Him, but Miryam stayed in the house.
\v 21 Therefore Martha said to ישוע, "Master, if You would have been here, my brother would not have died.
\v 22 Even now I know that, whatever You ask of Elohim, Elohim will give You."
\v 23 ישוע said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
\p
\v 24 Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
\p
\v 25 ישוע said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me will still live, even if he dies.
\v 26 Whoever lives and believes in Me will not die to the age. Do you believe this?"
\p
\v 27 She said to him, "Yes, Master. I have come to believe that You are the Messiah, the Son of Elohim, He who comes into the world."
\p
\v 28 When she had said this, she went away, and called Miryam, her sister, secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here, and is calling you."
\p
\v 29 When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to Him.
\v 30 Now ישוע had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.
\v 31 Then the Yehudim who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Miryam, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, thinking, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."
\v 32 Therefore when Miryam came to where ישוע was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, "Master, if You would have been here, my brother would not have died."
\p
\v 33 When ישוע therefore saw her weeping, and the Yehudim weeping who came with her, He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
\v 34 and said, "Where have you laid him?" They told Him, "Master, come and see."
\p
\v 35 ישוע wept.
\p
\v 36 The Yehudim therefore said, "See how much affection He had for him!"
\v 37 Some of them said, "Could this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, not have also kept this man from dying?"
\p
\v 38 ישוע therefore, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
\v 39 ישוע said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, "Master, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."
\p
\v 40 ישוע said to her, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of Elohim?"
\p
\v 41 So they took away the stone. ישוע lifted up His eyes, and said, "Father, I thank You that You listened to Me.
\v 42 I know that You always listen to Me, but because of the crowd standing around I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me."
\v 43 When He had said this, He cried with a loud voice, "Elazar, come out!"
\p
\v 44 He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. ישוע said to them, "Free him, and let him go."
\p
\v 45 Therefore many of the Yehudim, who came to Miryam and saw what ישוע did, believed in Him.
\s1 Conspiracy to Kill ישוע
\p
\v 46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which ישוע had done.
\v 47 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a Sanhedrin, and said, "What are we doing? For this man does many signs.
\v 48 If we leave Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
\s1 Qayapha's Prophecy
\p
\v 49 But a certain one of them, Qayapha, being high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,
\v 50 nor do you consider that it is advantageous for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."
\v 51 Now he did not say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that ישוע would die for the nation,
\v 52 and not for the nation only, but that He might also gather together into one the children of Elohim who are scattered abroad.
\v 53 So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put Him to death.
\v 54 ישוע therefore walked no more openly among the Yehudim, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephrayim. He stayed there with His talmidim.
\p
\v 55 Now the Pesaḥ of the Yehudim was at hand. Many went up from the country to Yerushalayim before the Pesaḥ, to purify themselves.
\v 56 Then they sought for ישוע and spoke one with another, as they stood in the Temple, "What do you think—that He is not coming to the Feast at all?"
\v 57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, that they might seize Him.
\c 12
\s1 Miryam Anoints ישוע
\p
\v 1 Then six days before the Pesaḥ, ישוע came to Bethany, where Elazar was, whom He raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they made Him a supper there. Martha served, but Elazar was one of those who sat at the table with Him.
\v 3 Miryam, therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of ישוע, and wiped His feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
\v 4 Then Yehudah Ish-Qerioth, one of His talmidim, who would betray Him, said,
\v 5 "Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?"
\v 6 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.
\v 7 But ישוע said, "Leave her alone, so that she may guard this for the day of My burial.
\v 8 For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me."
\p
\v 9 A large crowd therefore of the Yehudim learned that He was there, and they came, not for ישוע's sake only, but that they might see Elazar also, whom He had raised from the dead.
\v 10 But the chief priests conspired to put Elazar to death also,
\v 11 because on account of him many of the Yehudim went away and believed in ישוע.
\s1 Entering Yerushalayim
\p
\v 12 On the next day a great crowd had come to the Feast. When they heard that ישוע was coming to Yerushalayim,
\v 13 they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet Him, and cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the Name of יהוה, the King of Yisra'el!"
\p
\v 14 ישוע, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,
\v 15 "Do not be afraid, daughter of Tsion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt."
\v 16 His talmidim did not understand these things at first, but when ישוע was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him, and that they had done these things to Him.
\v 17 The crowd therefore that was with Him when He called Elazar out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.
\v 18 For this cause also the crowd went and met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.
\v 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after Him."
\s1 Greeks Seek ישוע; Prediction of Death
\p
\v 20 Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to bow down at the Feast.
\v 21 These, therefore, came to Philippos, who was from Beth-tsaida of the Galil, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we want to see ישוע."
\v 22 Philippos came and told Andreas, and in turn, Andreas came with Philippos, and they told ישוע.
\v 23 ישוע answered them, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
\v 24 Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.
\v 25 He who loves his life loses it. He who hates his life in this world will guard it to everlasting life.
\v 26 If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me. Where I am, there will My servant also be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.
\v 27 "Now My being is troubled. What shall I say? 'Father, save Me from this hour?' But for this cause I came to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify Your Name!" Then there came a voice out of the heavens, saying, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
\p
\v 29 The crowd therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others said, "A messenger has spoken to Him."
\p
\v 30 ישוע answered, "This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes.
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out.
\v 32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to Myself."
\v 33 But He said this, signifying by what kind of death He should die.
\v 34 The crowd answered Him, "We have heard out of the law that the Messiah remains to the age. How do You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up?' Who is this Son of Man?"
\p
\v 35 ישוע therefore said to them, "Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
\v 36 While you have the light, trust in the light, that you may become children of light." ישוע said these things, and He departed and hid Himself from them.
\v 37 But though He had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in Him,
\v 38 that the word of Yeshayahu the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, "Who has believed our message? To whom has the Arm of יהוה been revealed?"
\p
\v 39 For this cause they could not believe, for Yeshayahu said again,
\v 40 "He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and I would heal them."
\p
\v 41 Yeshayahu said these things because he saw His glory, and spoke of Him.
\v 42 Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue,
\v 43 for they loved men's praise more than the praise of Elohim.
\p
\v 44 ישוע cried out and said, "Whoever believes in Me, does not believe in Me, but in Him who sent Me.
\v 45 He who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.
\v 46 I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me may not remain in the darkness.
\v 47 If anyone listens to My sayings, and does not guard them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
\v 48 He who rejects Me, and does not receive My sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day.
\v 49 For I spoke not from Myself, but the Father who sent Me, He gave Me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.
\v 50 I know that His command is everlasting life. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak."
\c 13
\s1 Last Supper; Foot Washing
\p
\v 1 Now before the Feast of the Pesaḥ, ישוע, knowing that His hour had come that He would depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
\v 2 And supper taking place, the devil having already put into the heart of Yehudah Ish-Qerioth, Shimon's son, to betray Him;
\v 3 ישוע, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He came from Elohim, and was going to Elohim,
\v 4 arose from supper, and laid aside His outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around His waist.
\v 5 Then He poured water into the basin and began to wash the feet of the talmidim, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around Him.
\v 6 Then He came to Shimon Kepha. He said to Him, "Master, do You wash my feet?"
\p
\v 7 ישוע answered him, "You do not know what I am doing now, but you will understand later."
\p
\v 8 Kepha said to Him, "You will never, to the age, wash my feet!" ישוע answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me."
\p
\v 9 Shimon Kepha said to Him, "Master, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"
\p
\v 10 ישוע said to him, "Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you."
\v 11 For He knew him who would betray Him, therefore He said, "You are not all clean."
\v 12 So when He had washed their feet, put His outer garment back on, and sat down again, He said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?
\v 13 You call Me, 'Teacher' and 'Master.' You say so correctly, for so I am.
\v 14 If I then, the Master and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.
\v 16 Most certainly I tell you, a bondservant is not greater than his master, neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
\v 18 I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'
\v 19 From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am.
\v 20 Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives Me; and he who receives Me, receives Him who sent Me."
\s1 ישוע Predicts His Betrayal
\p
\v 21 When ישוע had said this, He was troubled in spirit, and testified, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray Me."
\p
\v 22 The talmidim looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke.
\v 23 One of His talmidim, whom ישוע loved, was at the table, leaning against the bosom of ישוע.
\v 24 Shimon Kepha therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, "Tell us who it is of whom He speaks."
\v 25 He, leaning back, as he was, on the bosom of ישוע, asked Him, "Master, who is it?"
\p
\v 26 ישוע therefore answered, "It is he to whom I will give this morsel when I have dipped it." So when He had dipped the morsel, He gave it to Yehudah, the son of Shimon Ish-Qerioth.
\v 27 After the morsel, then Satan entered into him. Then ישוע said to him, "What you do, do quickly."
\v 28 Now no man at the table knew why He said this to him.
\v 29 For some thought, because Yehudah had the money box, that ישוע said to him, "Buy what things we need for the Feast," or that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 Therefore having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.
\p
\v 31 When he had gone out, ישוע said, "Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and Elohim has been glorified in Him.
\v 32 If Elohim has been glorified in Him, Elohim will also glorify Him in Himself, and He will glorify Him immediately.
\v 33 Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek Me, and as I said to the Yehudim, 'Where I am going, you cannot come,' so now I tell you.
\v 34 A renewed command I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.
\v 35 By this everyone will know that you are My talmidim, if you have love for one another."
\p
\v 36 Shimon Kepha said to Him, "Master, where are You going?" ישוע answered, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow afterwards."
\v 37 Kepha said to Him, "Master, why can I not follow You now? I will lay down my life for You."
\v 38 ישוע answered him, "Will you lay down your life for Me? Most certainly I tell you, a rooster will not crow until you have denied Me three times.
\c 14
\s1 The Way, the Truth, and the Life
\p
\v 1 "Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in Elohim. Believe also in Me.
\v 2 In My Father's house are many homes. If it were not so, I would have told you. For I am going to prepare a place for you.
\v 3 If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to Myself; that where I am, you may be there also.
\v 4 Where I go, you know the way."
\p
\v 5 Taom said to Him, "Master, we do not know where You are going. How can we know the way?"
\v 6 ישוע said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through Me.
\v 7 If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also. From now on, you know Him, and have seen Him."
\v 8 Philippos said to Him, "Master, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."
\p
\v 9 ישוע said to him, "Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know Me, Philippos? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How do you say, 'Show us the Father?'
\v 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from Myself; but the Father who lives in Me does His works.
\v 11 Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me; or else believe Me for the very works' sake.
\v 12 Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to My Father.
\v 13 Whatever you will ask in My Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 If you will ask anything in My Name, I will do it.
\v 15 If you love Me, you will guard My commands.
\v 16 I will pray to the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, to be with you to the age—
\v 17 the Ruaḥ of truth, which the world cannot receive; for it does not see it, neither does it know it. You know it, for it lives with you, and will be in you.
\v 18 I will not leave you as orphans. I am coming to you.
\v 19 Yet a little while, and the world will see Me no more; but you will see Me. Because I live, you will live also.
\v 20 In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.
\v 21 One who has My commands, and guards them, that person is one who loves Me. One who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him, and will reveal Myself to him."
\p
\v 22 Yehudah (not Ish-Qerioth) said to Him, "Master, what has happened that You are about to reveal Yourself to us, and not to the world?"
\p
\v 23 ישוע answered him, "If a man loves Me, he will guard My word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.
\v 24 He who does not love Me does not guard My words. The word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me.
\v 25 I have said these things to you, while still living with you.
\p
\v 26 "But the Advocate, the Set-apart Ruaḥ, which the Father will send in My Name, that one will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.
\v 27 Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
\v 28 You heard how I told you, 'I go away, and I come to you.' If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to My Father; for the Father is greater than I.
\v 29 Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.
\v 30 I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in Me.
\v 31 But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.
\c 15
\s1 The True Vine
\p
\v 1 "I am the true vine, and My Father is the farmer.
\v 2 Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
\v 3 You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Remain in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in Me.
\v 5 I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in Me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.
\v 6 If a man does not remain in Me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
\v 7 If you remain in Me, and My words remain in you, ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.
\p
\v 8 "In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be My talmidim.
\v 9 Even as the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you. Remain in My love.
\v 10 If you guard My commands, you will remain in My love; even as I have guarded My Father's commands, and remain in His love.
\v 11 I have spoken these things to you, that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.
\p
\v 12 "This is My command, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.
\v 13 Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.
\v 14 You are My friends, if you do whatever I command you.
\v 15 No longer do I call you bondservants, for the bondservant does not know what his master does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from My Father, I have made known to you.
\v 16 You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in My Name, He may give it to you.
\p
\v 17 "I command these things to you, that you may love one another."
\s1 World's Hatred
\p
\v 18 "If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it hated you.
\v 19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
\v 20 Remember the word that I said to you: 'A bondservant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they guarded My word, they will also guard yours.
\v 21 But all these things will they do to you for My Name's sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
\v 23 He who hates Me, hates My Father also.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both Me and My Father.
\v 25 But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, 'They hated Me without a cause.'
\p
\v 26 "When the Advocate has come, which I will send to you from the Father, the Ruaḥ of truth, that proceeds from the Father, that one will testify about Me.
\v 27 You will also testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
\c 16
\s1 Work of the Set-apart Ruaḥ
\p
\v 1 "I have said these things to you so that you would not stumble.
\v 2 They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the hour comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to Elohim.
\v 3 They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor Me.
\v 4 But I have told you these things, so that when the hour comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
\v 5 But now I am going to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, 'Where are you going?'
\v 6 But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.
\v 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you. But if I go, I will send it to you.
\v 8 When it has come, it will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;
\v 9 about sin, because they do not believe in Me;
\v 10 about righteousness, because I am going to My Father, and you will not see Me anymore;
\v 11 about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
\p
\v 12 "I have yet many things to tell you, but you cannot bear them now.
\v 13 However when the Ruaḥ of truth has come, that one will guide you into all truth, for it will not speak from itself; but whatever it hears, it will speak. It will declare to you things that are coming.
\v 14 This one will glorify Me, for it will take from what is Mine, and will declare it to you.
\v 15 All things whatever the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes from Mine, and will declare it to you.
\v 16 A little while, and you will no longer see Me. Again a little while, and you will see Me."
\p
\v 17 Some of His talmidim therefore said to one another, "What is this that He says to us, 'A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me;' and, 'Because I go to the Father'?"
\v 18 They said therefore, "What is this that He says, 'A little while'? We do not know what He is saying."
\p
\v 19 Therefore ישוע perceived that they wanted to ask Him, and He said to them, "Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, 'A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see me'?
\v 20 Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
\v 21 A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her hour has come. But when she has delivered the child, she does not remember the affliction anymore, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.
\v 22 Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.
\s1 Ask and You Will Receive
\p
\v 23 "In that day you will ask Me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in My Name, He will give it to you.
\v 24 Until now, you have asked nothing in My Name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.
\v 25 I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But an hour is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.
\v 26 In that day you will ask in My Name; and I do not say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,
\v 27 for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came from Elohim.
\v 28 I came from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."
\p
\v 29 His talmidim said to Him, "Behold, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech.
\v 30 Now we know that You know all things, and do not need for anyone to question You. By this we believe that You came from Elohim."
\p
\v 31 ישוע answered them, "Do you now believe?
\v 32 Behold, the hour is coming, yes, and has come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave Me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.
\v 33 I have told you these things, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction; but take courage! I have overcome the world."
\c 17
\s1 Prayer for those Belonging to ישוע
\p
\v 1 ישוע said these things, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son may also glorify You;
\v 2 even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, so He will give everlasting life to all whom You have given Him.
\v 3 This is everlasting life, that they should know You, the only true Elohim, and Him whom You sent, ישוע Messiah.
\v 4 I glorified You on the earth. I have accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.
\v 5 Now, Father, glorify Me with Your own self with the glory which I had with You before the world was.
\v 6 I revealed Your Name to the people whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You have given them to Me. They have guarded Your word.
\v 7 Now they have known that all things whatever You have given Me are from You,
\v 8 for the words which You have given Me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came from You, and they have believed that You sent Me.
\v 9 I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.
\p
\v 10 "All things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them.
\v 11 I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to You. Set-apart Father, guard them through Your Name which You have given Me, that they may be one, even as We are.
\v 12 While I was with them, I guarded them in Your Name which You have given Me; I have guarded them. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
\v 13 But now I come to You, and I say these things in the world, that they may have My joy made full in themselves.
\p
\v 14 I have given them Your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\v 15 I pray not that You would take them from the world, but that You would guard them from the evil one.
\v 16 They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
\v 17 Set them apart in the truth. Your word is truth.
\v 18 As You sent Me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.
\v 19 For their sakes I set Myself apart, that they themselves also may be set apart in truth.
\v 20 Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who will believe in Me through their word,
\v 21 that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me, and I in you, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You sent Me.
\s1 Future Glory
\p
\v 22 "The glory which You have given Me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;
\v 23 I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You loved Me.
\v 24 Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, that they may see My glory, which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.
\v 25 Righteous Father, the world has not known You, but I knew You; and these knew that You sent Me.
\v 26 I made known to them Your Name, and will make it known; that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them."
\c 18
\s1 Betrayal and Arrest
\p
\v 1 When ישוע had spoken these words, He went out with His talmidim over the brook Qidron, where there was a garden, into which He and His talmidim entered.
\v 2 Now Yehudah, who betrayed Him, also knew the place, for ישוע often met there with His talmidim.
\v 3 Yehudah then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
\v 4 ישוע therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to Him, went out, and said to them, "Who are you looking for?"
\p
\v 5 They answered Him, "ישוע of Nazareth." ישוע said to them, "I am." Yehudah also, who betrayed Him, was standing with them.
\v 6 When therefore He said to them, "I am," they went backward, and fell to the ground.
\p
\v 7 Again therefore He asked them, "Who are you looking for?" They said, "ישוע of Nazareth."
\p
\v 8 ישוע answered, "I told you that I am. If therefore you seek Me, let these go their way,"
\v 9 that the word might be fulfilled which He spoke, "Of those whom you have given Me, I have lost none."
\p
\v 10 Shimon Kepha therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's bondservant, and cut off his right ear. The bondservant's name was Malekh.
\v 11 ישוע therefore said to Kepha, "Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not surely drink it?"
\s1 ישוע Before the Priests
\p
\v 12 So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Yehudim, seized ישוע and bound Him,
\v 13 and led Him to Ḥananyah first, for he was father-in-law to Qayapha, who was high priest that year.
\v 14 Now it was Qayapha who advised the Yehudim that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.
\v 15 Shimon Kepha followed ישוע, as did another talmid. Now that talmid was known to the high priest, and entered in with ישוע into the court of the high priest;
\v 16 but Kepha was standing at the door outside. So the other talmid, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Kepha.
\v 17 Then the maid who kept the door said to Kepha, "Are you also one of this man's talmidim?" He said, "I am not."
\p
\v 18 Now the bondservants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Kepha was with them, standing and warming himself.
\v 19 The high priest therefore asked ישוע about His talmidim, and about His teaching.
\v 20 ישוע answered him, "I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the Temple, where the all Yehudim are. I said nothing in secret.
\v 21 Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard Me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said."
\p
\v 22 When He had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped ישוע with his hand, saying, "Do you answer the high priest like that?"
\p
\v 23 ישוע answered him, "If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat Me?"
\p
\v 24 Ḥananyah sent Him bound to Qayapha, the high priest.
\s1 Kepha's Denial
\p
\v 25 Now Shimon Kepha was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, "You are not also one of His talmidim, are you?" He denied it, and said, "I am not."
\p
\v 26 One of the bondservants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Kepha had cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"
\p
\v 27 Kepha therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
\s1 ישוע Before Pilate
\p
\v 28 They led ישוע therefore from Qayapha into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Pesaḥ.
\v 29 Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?"
\p
\v 30 They answered him, "If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you."
\p
\v 31 Pilate therefore said to them, "Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law." Therefore the Yehudim said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,"
\v 32 that the word of ישוע might be fulfilled, which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He should die.
\p
\v 33 Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called ישוע, and said to Him, "Are You the King of the Yehudim?"
\p
\v 34 ישוע answered him, "Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about Me?"
\p
\v 35 Pilate answered, "I am not a Yehudite, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You to me. What have You done?"
\p
\v 36 ישוע answered, "My Kingdom is not of this world. If My Kingdom were of this world, then My servants would fight, that I would not be delivered to the Yehudim. But now My Kingdom is not from here."
\p
\v 37 Pilate therefore said to Him, "Are you a king then?" ישוע answered, "You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to My voice."
\p
\v 38 Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" When he had said this, he went out again to the Yehudim, and said to them, "I find no basis for a charge against Him.
\v 39 But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Pesaḥ. Therefore, do you want me to release to you the King of the Yehudim?"
\p
\v 40 Then they shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Bar-Abba!" Now Bar-Abba was a robber.
\c 19
\s1 Crown of Thorns
\p
\v 1 So Pilate then took ישוע, and flogged Him.
\v 2 The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple garment.
\v 3 They kept saying, "Hail, King of the Yehudim!" and they were coming to Him and continued slapping Him.
\p
\v 4 Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I bring Him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against Him."
\p
\v 5 ישוע therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, "Behold, the man!"
\p
\v 6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify!" Pilate said to them, "Take Him yourselves, and crucify Him, for I find no basis for a charge against Him."
\p
\v 7 The Yehudim answered him, "We have a law, and by the law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of Elohim."
\p
\v 8 When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.
\v 9 He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to ישוע, "Where are You from?" But ישוע gave him no answer.
\v 10 Pilate therefore said to him, "Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have power to release You, and have power to crucify You?"
\p
\v 11 ישוע answered, "You would have no power at all against Me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered Me to you has greater sin."
\p
\v 12 At this, Pilate was seeking to release Him, but the Yehudim cried out, saying, "If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!"
\p
\v 13 When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought ישוע out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called "The Pavement", but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha."
\v 14 Now it was the Preparation Day of the Pesaḥ, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Yehudim, "Behold, your King!"
\p
\v 15 They cried out, "Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"
\s1 ישוע Crucified
\p
\v 16 So then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took ישוע.
\v 17 He went out, Himself bearing the stake, to the place called "The Place of a Skull", which is called in Hebrew, "Gulgoleth",
\v 18 where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, on either side one, and ישוע in the middle.
\v 19 Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the stake. There was written, "ישוע of Nazareth, the King of the Yehudim."
\v 20 Therefore many of the Yehudim read this title, for the place where ישוע was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
\v 21 The chief priests of the Yehudim therefore said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Yehudim,' but, 'He said, "I am King of the Yehudim."'"
\p
\v 22 Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
\p
\v 23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified ישוע, took His garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
\v 24 Then they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be," that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, "They parted My garments among them. For My cloak they cast lots." Therefore the soldiers did these things.
\p
\v 25 But there were standing by the stake of ישוע, His mother and His mother's sister, Miryam the wife of Aḥav, and Miryam from Magdala.
\v 26 Therefore when ישוע saw His mother, and the talmid whom He loved standing there, He said to His mother, "Woman, behold, your son!"
\v 27 Then He said to the talmid, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour, the talmid took her to his own home.
\v 28 After this, ישוע, knowing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."
\v 29 Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at His mouth.
\v 30 When ישוע therefore had received the vinegar, He said, "It is finished." He bowed His head, and gave up His spirit.
\s1 Preparation Day
\p
\v 31 Therefore the Yehudim, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies would not remain on the stake on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a High Day), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
\v 32 Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with Him;
\v 33 but when they came to ישוע, and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
\v 34 However one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
\v 35 He who has seen has testified, and his witness is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.
\v 36 For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of Him will not be broken."
\v 37 Again another Scripture says, "They will look on Him whom they pierced."
\s1 Burial of ישוע
\p
\v 38 After these things, Yoseph of Ramah, being a talmid of ישוע, but secretly for fear of the Yehudim, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of ישוע. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away His body.
\v 39 Nikodemos, who at first came to ישוע by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.
\v 40 So they took ישוע's body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Yehudim is to bury.
\v 41 Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a renewed tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.
\v 42 Then because of the Preparation Day of the Yehudim (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid ישוע there.
\c 20
\s1 The Resurrection
\p
\v 1 Now on the first of the week, Miryam from Magdala went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
\v 2 Therefore she ran and came to Shimon Kepha, and to the other talmid whom ישוע loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him!"
\v 3 Therefore Kepha and the other talmid went out, and they went toward the tomb.
\v 4 They both ran together. The other talmid outran Kepha, and came to the tomb first.
\v 5 Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he did not enter in.
\v 6 Then Shimon Kepha came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,
\v 7 and the cloth that had been on His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
\v 8 So then the other talmid who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.
\v 9 For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that He must rise from the dead.
\v 10 So the talmidim went away again to their own homes.
\v 11 But Miryam was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,
\v 12 and she saw two messengers in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of ישוע had lain.
\v 13 They told her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Master, and I do not know where they have laid Him."
\v 14 When she had said this, she turned around and saw ישוע standing, and did not know that it was ישוע.
\p
\v 15 ישוע said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?" She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, "Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away."
\v 16 ישוע said to her, "Miryam." She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" which is to say, "Teacher!"
\v 17 ישוע said to her, "Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brothers, and tell them, 'I am ascending to My Father and your Father, to My Elohim and your Elohim.'"
\s1 ישוע Among the Talmidim
\p
\v 18 Miryam from Magdala came and told the talmidim, "I have seen the Master," and that He had said these things to her.
\v 19 When therefore it was evening, on that day, day one of the week, and when the doors were locked where the talmidim were, for fear of the Yehudim, ישוע came and stood in the middle, and said to them, "Peace be to you."
\p
\v 20 When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The talmidim therefore were glad when they saw the Master.
\v 21 He therefore said to them again, "Peace be to you. As the Father has sent Me, even so I send you."
\v 22 When He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Set-apart Ruaḥ!
\v 23 If you forgive anyone's sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone's sins, they have been retained."
\p
\v 24 But Taom, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when ישוע came.
\v 25 The other talmidim therefore said to him, "We have seen the Master!" But he said to them, "Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe."
\v 26 After eight days again His talmidim were inside, and Taom was with them. ישוע came, the doors being locked, and stood in the middle, and said, "Peace be to you."
\v 27 Then He said to Taom, "Reach here your finger, and see My hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into My side. Do not disbelieve, but believe."
\v 28 Taom answered Him, "My Master and my Elohim!"
\v 29 ישוע said to him, "Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed."
\v 30 Therefore ישוע did many other signs in the presence of His talmidim, which are not written in this book;
\v 31 but these are written, that you may believe that ישוע is the Messiah, the Son of Elohim, and that believing you may have life in His Name.
\c 21
\s1 ישוע Appears at the Sea of the Galil
\p
\v 1 After these things, ישוע revealed Himself again to the talmidim at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed Himself this way.
\v 2 Shimon Kepha, Taom called Didymus, Nathana'el of Qanah in the Galil, and the sons of Zevadyahu, and two others of His talmidim were together.
\v 3 Shimon Kepha said to them, "I am going fishing." They told him, "We are also coming with you." They went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.
\v 4 But when day had already come, ישוע stood on the beach, yet the talmidim did not know that it was ישוע.
\v 5 ישוע therefore said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?" They answered Him, "No."
\p
\v 6 He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." They cast it therefore, and now they were not able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.
\v 7 That talmid therefore whom ישוע loved said to Kepha, "It is the Master!" So when Shimon Kepha heard that it was the Master, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 But the other talmidim came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish.
\v 9 So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
\v 10 ישוע said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have just caught."
\p
\v 11 Shimon Kepha went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net was not torn.
\p
\v 12 ישוע said to them, "Come and eat the afternoon meal." None of the talmidim dared inquire of Him, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Master.
\p
\v 13 Then ישוע came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
\v 14 This is now the third time that ישוע was revealed to His talmidim, after He had risen from the dead.
\v 15 So when they had eaten their afternoon meal, ישוע said to Shimon Kepha, "Shimon, son of Yonah, do you love Me more than these?" He said to Him, "Yes, Master; You know that I have affection for You." He said to him, "Feed My lambs."
\v 16 He said to him again a second time, "Shimon, son of Yonah, do you love Me?" He said to Him, "Yes, Master; You know that I have affection for You." He said to him, "Tend My sheep."
\v 17 He said to him the third time, "Shimon, son of Yonah, do you have affection for Me?" Kepha was grieved because He asked him the third time, "Do you have affection for me?" He said to him, "Master, You know everything. You know that I have affection for You." ישוע said to him, "Feed My sheep.
\v 18 Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you do not want to go."
\v 19 Now He said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify Elohim. When He had said this, He said to him, "Follow Me."
\v 20 Then Kepha, turning around, saw a talmid following. This was the talmid whom ישוע loved, the one who had also leaned on the breast of ישוע at the supper and asked, "Master, who is going to betray You?"
\v 21 Kepha seeing him, said to ישוע, "Master, what about this man?"
\v 22 ישוע said to him, "If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me."
\v 23 This saying therefore went out among the brothers, that this talmid would not die. Yet ישוע did not say to him that he would not die, but, "If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?"
\p
\v 24 This is the talmid who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true.
\v 25 There are also many other things which ישוע did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself would not have room for the books that would be written.
