\v 1 It happened after the death of Yehoshua, the children of Yisra'el asked of יהוה, saying, "Who should go up for us first against the Kena'anites, to fight against them?"
\v 2 יהוה said, "Yehudah shall go up. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand."
\v 3 Yehudah said to Shimon his brother, "Come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the Kena'anites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot." So Shimon went with him.
\v 4 Yehudah went up; and יהוה delivered the Kena'anites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they struck of them in Bezeq ten thousand men.
\v 5 They found Adoni-Bezeq in Bezeq; and they fought against him, and they struck the Kena'anites and the Perizzites.
\v 6 But Adoni-Bezeq fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
\v 7 Adoni-Bezeq said, "Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table: as I have done, so Elohim has requited me." They brought him to Yerushalyim, and he died there.
\p
\v 8 The children of Yehudah fought against Yerushalyim, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
\v 9 Afterward the children of Yehudah went down to fight against the Kena'anites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.
\v 10 Yehudah went against the Kena'anites who lived in Ḥevron (now the name of Ḥevron before was Qiryath Arba); and they struck Sheshai, and Aḥiman, and Talmai.
\p
\v 11 From there he went against the inhabitants of Devir. (Now the name of Devir before was Qiryath Sepher.)
\v 12 Kalev said, "He who strikes Qiryath Sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Aksah my daughter as wife."
\v 13 Othni'el the son of Qenaz, Kalev's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Aksah his daughter as wife.
\v 14 It happened, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her donkey; and Kalev said to her, "What would you like?"
\v 15 She said to him, "Give me a blessing; for that you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water." Then Kalev gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
\p
\v 16 The children of the Qenite, Mosheh's brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Yehudah into the wilderness of Yehudah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.
\v 17 Yehudah went with Shimon his brother, and they struck the Kena'anites who inhabited Tsephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Ḥormah.
\v 18 Also Yehudah took Gaza with its border, and Ashqelon with its border, and Eqron with its border.
\v 19 יהוה was with Yehudah; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
\v 20 They gave Ḥevron to Kalev, as Mosheh had spoken: and he drove out there the three sons of Anaq.
\v 21 The children of Benyamin did not drive out the Yevusites who inhabited Yerushalyim; but the Yevusites dwell with the children of Benyamin in Yerushalyim to this day.
\p
\v 22 The house of Yoseph, they also went up against Beth-El; and יהוה was with them.
\v 23 The house of Yoseph sent to spy out Beth-El. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)
\v 24 The guards saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, "Please show us the entrance into the city, and we will deal with you in loving-kindness."
\v 25 He showed them the entrance into the city; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family.
\v 26 The man went into the land of the Ḥittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.
\p
\v 27 Menasheh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor of Ta'anakh and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Yivleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Kena'anites would dwell in that land.
\v 28 It happened, when Yisra'el had grown strong, that they put the Kena'anites to forced labor, and did not utterly drive them out.
\p
\v 29 Ephrayim did not drive out the Kena'anites who lived in Gezer; but the Kena'anites lived in Gezer among them.
\p
\v 30 Zevulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Qitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Kena'anites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.
\p
\v 31 Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Akko, nor the inhabitants of Tsidon, nor of Aḥlav, nor of Akziv, nor of Ḥelbah, nor of Aphiq, nor of Reḥov;
\v 32 but the Asherites lived among the Kena'anites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
\p
\v 33 Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived among the Kena'anites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor.
\p
\v 34 The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;
\v 35 but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Ḥeres, in Aiyalon, and in Sha'albim: yet the hand of the house of Yoseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor.
\v 36 The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Aqrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

\p
\v 1 The messenger of יהוה came up from Gilgal to Bokim. He said, "I made you to go up out of Mitsrayim, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, 'I will never break My covenant with you:
\v 2 and you shall cut no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.' But you have not listened to My voice: why have you done this?
\v 3 Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their elohim shall be a snare to you."
\v 4 It happened, when the messenger of יהוה spoke these words to all the children of Yisra'el, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\v 5 They called the name of that place Bokim: and they slaughtered there to יהוה.
\p
\v 6 Now when Yehoshua had sent the people away, the children of Yisra'el went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
\v 7 The people served יהוה all the days of Yehoshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Yehoshua, who had seen all the great work of יהוה that He had worked for Yisra'el.
\v 8 Yehoshua the son of Nun, the servant of יהוה, died, being one hundred ten years old.
\v 9 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Ḥeres, in the hill country of Ephrayim, on the north of the mountain of Ga'ash.
\v 10 Also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, who did not know יהוה, nor yet the work which He had worked for Yisra'el.
\p
\v 11 The children of Yisra'el did that which was evil in the eyes of יהוה, and served the Ba'als;
\v 12 and they forsook יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim, and followed other elohim, of the elohim of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them: and they provoked יהוה to anger.
\v 13 They forsook יהוה, and served Ba'al and the Ashtaroth.
\v 14 The anger of יהוה was kindled against Yisra'el, and He delivered them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
\v 15 Wherever they went out, the Hand of יהוה was against them for evil, as יהוה had spoken, and as יהוה had sworn to them: and they were very distressed.
\p
\v 16 יהוה raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them.
\v 17 Yet they did not listen to their judges; for they whored after other elohim, and bowed themselves down to them: they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked, obeying the commands of יהוה; but they did not do so.
\v 18 When יהוה raised them up judges, then יהוה was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it grieved יהוה because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them.
\v 19 But it happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other elohim to serve them, and to bow down to them; they did not cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
\v 20 The anger of יהוה was kindled against Yisra'el; and He said, "Because this nation have transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to My voice;
\v 21 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Yehoshua left when he died;
\v 22 that by them I may prove Yisra'el, whether they will guard the way of יהוה to walk therein, as their fathers did guard it, or not."
\v 23 So יהוה left those nations, without driving them out hastily; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Yehoshua.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now these are the nations which יהוה left, to prove Yisra'el by them, even as many of Yisra'el as had not known all the wars of Kena'an;
\v 2 only that the generations of the children of Yisra'el might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it:
\v 3 namely, the five rulers of the Philistines, and all the Kena'anites, and the Tsidonians, and the Ḥivites who lived on Mount Levanon, from Mount Ba'al Ḥermon to the entrance of Ḥamath.
\v 4 They were left, to prove Yisra'el by them, to know whether they would listen to the commands of יהוה, which He commanded their fathers by Mosheh.
\v 5 The children of Yisra'el lived among the Kena'anites, the Ḥittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Ḥivites, and the Yevusites:
\v 6 and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their elohim.
\p
\v 7 The children of Yisra'el did that which was evil in the eyes of יהוה, and forgot יהוה their Elohim, and served the Ba'als and the Asheroth.
\v 8 Therefore the anger of יהוה was kindled against Yisra'el, and He sold them into the hand of Kushan Rishathaim king of Aram-Naharayim: and the children of Yisra'el served Kushan Rishathaim eight years.
\p
\v 9 When the children of Yisra'el cried to יהוה, יהוה raised up a savior to the children of Yisra'el, who saved them, even Othni'el the son of Qenaz, Kalev's younger brother.
\v 10 The Ruaḥ of יהוה came on him, and he judged Yisra'el; and he went out to war, and יהוה delivered Kushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Kushan Rishathaim.
\v 11 The land had rest forty years. Othni'el the son of Qenaz died.
\p
\v 12 The children of Yisra'el again did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה: and יהוה strengthened Eglon the king of Moav against Yisra'el, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of יהוה.
\v 13 He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amaleq; and he went and struck Yisra'el, and they possessed the city of palm trees.
\v 14 The children of Yisra'el served Eglon the king of Moav eighteen years.
\p
\v 15 But when the children of Yisra'el cried to יהוה, יהוה raised them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benyamite, a man left-handed. The children of Yisra'el sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moav.
\v 16 Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.
\v 17 He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moav; and Eglon was a very fat man.
\v 18 When he finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who bore the tribute.
\v 19 But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, "I have a secret errand to you, king." The king said, "Keep silence!" All who stood by him went out from him.
\v 20 Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, "I have a message from Elohim to you." He arose out of his seat.
\v 21 Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon's body:
\v 22 and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.
\v 23 Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.
\p
\v 24 Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, "Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room."
\v 25 They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he did not open the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened them, and behold, their master was fallen down dead on the earth.
\p
\v 26 Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.
\v 27 It happened, when he had come, that he blew a shofar in the hill country of Ephrayim; and the children of Yisra'el went down with him from the hill country, and he before them.
\v 28 He said to them, "Follow me; for יהוה has delivered your enemies the Moavites into your hand." They followed him, and took the fords of the Yarden against the Moavites, and did not allow any man to pass over.
\v 29 They struck of Moav at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.
\v 30 So Moav was subdued that day under the hand of Yisra'el. The land had rest eighty years.
\p
\v 31 After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad: and he also saved Yisra'el.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 The children of Yisra'el again did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, when Ehud was dead.
\v 2 יהוה sold them into the hand of Yavin king of Kena'an, who reigned in Ḥatsor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Ḥarosheth of the Nations.
\v 3 The children of Yisra'el cried to יהוה: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and for twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 4 Now Devorah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Yisra'el at that time.
\v 5 She lived under the palm tree of Devorah between Ramah and Beth-El in the hill country of Ephrayim: and the children of Yisra'el came up to her for judgment.
\v 6 She sent and called Baraq the son of Avinoam out of Qedesh Naphtali, and said to him, "Has not יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, commanded, 'Go and draw to Mount Tavor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zevulun?
\v 7 I will draw to you, to the wadi Qishon, Sisera, the captain of Yavin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.'"
\v 8 Baraq said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
\v 9 She said, "I will surely go with you: nevertheless, the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for יהוה will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Devorah arose, and went with Baraq to Qedesh.
\v 10 Baraq called Zevulun and Naphtali together to Qedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Devorah went up with him.
\p
\v 11 Now Ḥeber the Qenite had separated himself from the Qenites, even from the children of Ḥovav the brother-in-law of Mosheh, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Tsa'anannim, which is by Qedesh.
\p
\v 12 They told Sisera that Baraq the son of Avinoam was gone up to Mount Tavor.
\v 13 Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Ḥarosheth of the Nations, to the wadi Qishon.
\v 14 Devorah said to Baraq, "Go; for this is the day in which יהוה has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not יהוה gone out before you?" So Baraq went down from Mount Tavor, and ten thousand men after him.
\v 15 יהוה routed Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Baraq; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
\v 16 But Baraq pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Ḥarosheth of the Nations: and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
\p
\v 17 However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Yael the wife of Ḥeber the Qenite; for there was peace between Yavin the king of Ḥatsor and the house of Ḥeber the Qenite.
\v 18 Yael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, "Turn in, my master, turn in to me; do not be afraid." He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
\v 19 He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." She opened a skin of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
\v 20 He said to her, "Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man comes and inquires of you, and says, 'Is there any man here?' that you shall say, 'No.'"
\v 21 Then Yael, Ḥeber's wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.
\v 22 Behold, as Baraq pursued Sisera, Yael came out to meet him, and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek." He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.
\p
\v 23 So Elohim subdued on that day Yavin the king of Kena'an before the children of Yisra'el.
\v 24 The hand of the children of Yisra'el prevailed more and more against Yavin the king of Kena'an, until they had cut off Yavin king of Kena'an.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Then Devorah and Baraq the son of Avinoam sang on that day, saying,
\p
\v 2 "Because the leaders took the lead in Yisra'el, because the people offered themselves willingly, blessed be יהוה!
\p
\v 3 "Hear, you kings! Give ear, you princes! I, even I, will sing to יהוה. I will sing praise to יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 4 "יהוה, when You went forth out of Seir, when You marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped. Yes, the clouds dropped water.
\p
\v 5 "The mountains quaked at the presence of יהוה, even Sinai, at the presence of יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 6 "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Yael, the highways were unoccupied. The travelers walked through byways.
\p
\v 7 "The rulers ceased in Yisra'el. They ceased until I, Devorah, arose; until I arose a mother in Yisra'el.
\p
\v 8 "They chose new elohim. Then war was in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Yisra'el?
\p
\v 9 "My heart is toward the governors of Yisra'el, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless יהוה!
\p
\v 10 "Tell of it, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way.
\p
\v 11 "Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there they will rehearse the righteous acts of יהוה, even the righteous acts of His rule in Yisra'el. Then the people of יהוה went down to the gates."
\p
\v 12 "Awake, awake, Devorah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Baraq, and lead away your captives, you son of Avinoam.
\p
\v 13 "Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down. יהוה came down for me against the mighty.
\p
\v 14 "Those whose root is in Amaleq came out of Ephrayim, after you, Benyamin, among your peoples. Governors come down out of Makir. Those who handle the marshal's staff came out of Zevulun.
\p
\v 15 "The princes of Yissakhar were with Devorah. As was Yissakhar, so was Baraq. They rushed into the valley at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuven, there were great resolves of heart.
\p
\v 16 "Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, to hear the whistling for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuven there were great searchings of heart.
\p
\v 17 "Gilad lived beyond the Yarden. Why did Dan remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and lived by his creeks.
\p
\v 18 "Zevulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths; Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
\p
\v 19 "The kings came and fought, then the kings of Kena'an fought at Ta'anakh by the waters of Megiddo. They took no plunder of silver.
\p
\v 20 "From the heavens the stars fought. From their courses, they fought against Sisera.
\p
\v 21 "The wadi Qishon swept them away, that ancient wadi, the wadi Qishon. My being, march on with strength.
\p
\v 22 "Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.
\p
\v 23 "'Curse Meroz,' said the messenger of יהוה. 'Curse bitterly its inhabitants, because they did not come to help יהוה, to help יהוה against the mighty.'
\p
\v 24 "Yael shall be blessed above women, the wife of Ḥeber the Qenite; blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
\p
\v 25 "He asked for water. She gave him milk. She brought him butter in a magnificent bowl.
\p
\v 26 "She put her hand to the tent peg, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer. With the hammer she struck Sisera. She struck through his head. Yes, she pierced and struck through his temples.
\p
\v 27 "At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay. At her feet he bowed, he fell. Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
\p
\v 28 "Through the window she looked out, and cried: Sisera's mother looked through the lattice. 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?'
\p
\v 29 "Her wise ladies answered her, 'Yes', she returned answer to herself,
\p
\v 30 "'Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? A maiden or two to every man; to Sisera a spoil of dyed garments, a spoil of dyed garments embroidered, of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?'
\p
\v 31 "So let all your enemies perish, יהוה, but let those who love Him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength." Then the land had rest forty years.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 The children of Yisra'el did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה: and יהוה delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
\v 2 The hand of Midian prevailed against Yisra'el; and because of Midian the children of Yisra'el made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
\v 3 So it was, when Yisra'el had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amaleqites, and the children of the east; they came up against them;
\v 4 and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, until you come to Gaza, and left no sustenance in Yisra'el, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.
\v 5 For they came up with their livestock and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it.
\v 6 Yisra'el was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Yisra'el cried to יהוה.
\p
\v 7 It happened, when the children of Yisra'el cried to יהוה because of Midian,
\v 8 that יהוה sent a prophet to the children of Yisra'el: and he said to them, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'I brought you up from Mitsrayim, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
\v 9 and I delivered you out of the hand of the Mitsrayimians, and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
\v 10 and I said to you, "I am יהוה your Elohim; you shall not fear the elohim of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell." But you have not listened to My voice.'"
\p
\v 11 The messenger of יהוה came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Yoash the Aviezrite: and his son Gidon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
\v 12 The messenger of יהוה appeared to him, and said to him, "יהוה is with you, you mighty man of valor!"
\v 13 Gidon said to him, "Oh, my master, if יהוה is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, 'Did יהוה not bring us up from Mitsrayim?' But now יהוה has cast us off, and delivered us into the palm of Midian."
\v 14 יהוה looked at him, and said, "Go in this your might, and save Yisra'el from the palm of Midian. Have I not sent you?"
\v 15 He said to him, "O יהוה, how shall I save Yisra'el? Behold, my family is the poorest in Menasheh, and I am the least in my father's house."
\v 16 יהוה said to him, "Surely I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man."
\p
\v 17 He said to Him, "If now I have found favor in Your eyes, then show me a sign that it is You who talk with me.
\v 18 Please do not go away, until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you." He said, "I will wait until you come back."
\p
\v 19 Gidon went in, and prepared a young goat, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal. He put the meat in a basket and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.
\v 20 The messenger of Elohim said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth." He did so.
\v 21 Then the messenger of יהוה stretched out the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire went up out of the rock, and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes; and the messenger of יהוה departed out of his sight.
\v 22 Gidon saw that He was the messenger of יהוה; and Gidon said, "Alas, Adonai יהוה! Because I have seen the messenger of יהוה face to face!"
\v 23 יהוה said to him, "Peace be to you! Do not be afraid. You shall not die."
\p
\v 24 Then Gidon built an altar there to יהוה, and called it "יהוה is Peace." To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Aviezrites.
\p
\v 25 It happened the same night, that יהוה said to him, "Take your father's bull, even the second bull seven years old, and throw down the altar of Ba'al that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
\v 26 and build an altar to יהוה your Elohim on the top of this stronghold, in an orderly way, and take the second bull, and offer an ascension offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down."
\v 27 Then Gidon took ten men of his servants, and did as יהוה had spoken to him; and it came about, because he feared his father's household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
\p
\v 28 When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Ba'al was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built.
\v 29 They said one to another, "Who has done this thing?" When they inquired and asked, they said, "Gidon the son of Yoash has done this thing."
\v 30 Then the men of the city said to Yoash, "Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Ba'al, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it."
\v 31 Yoash said to all who stood against him, "Will you contend for Ba'al? Or will you save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death while it is yet morning. If he is an el, let him contend for himself, because someone has broken down his altar."
\v 32 Therefore on that day he named him Yerub-Ba'al, saying, "Let Ba'al contend against him, because he has broken down his altar."
\p
\v 33 Then all the Midianites and the Amaleqites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Yizre'el.
\v 34 But the Ruaḥ of יהוה came on Gidon; and he blew a shofar; and Aviezer was gathered together after him.
\v 35 He sent messengers throughout all Menasheh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zevulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
\p
\v 36 Gidon said to Elohim, "If You will save Yisra'el by my hand, as You have spoken,
\v 37 behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground, then shall I know that You will save Yisra'el by my hand, as You have spoken."
\v 38 It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
\v 39 Gidon said to Elohim, "Do not let Your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew."
\v 40 Elohim did so that night: for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Then Yerubba'al, who is Gidon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
\p
\v 2 יהוה said to Gidon, "The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Yisra'el vaunt themselves against Me, saying, 'My own hand has saved me.'
\v 3 Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilad.'" Twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.
\p
\v 4 יהוה said to Gidon, "The people are still too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. It shall be, that of whom I tell you, 'This shall go with you,' the same shall go with you; and of whomever I tell you, 'This shall not go with you,' the same shall not go."
\v 5 So he brought down the people to the water; and יהוה said to Gidon, "Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink."
\v 6 The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.
\v 7 יהוה said to Gidon, "By the three hundred men who lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, each to his own place."
\v 8 So the people took food in their hand, and their shofars; and he sent all the men of Yisra'el every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
\p
\v 9 It happened the same night, that יהוה said to him, "Arise, go down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.
\v 10 But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp:
\v 11 and you shall hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp." Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.
\v 12 The Midianites and the Amaleqites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude.
\v 13 When Gidon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow; and he said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat."
\v 14 His fellow answered, "This is nothing other than the sword of Gidon the son of Yoash, a man of Yisra'el. Elohim has delivered Midian into his hand, with all the army."
\p
\v 15 It was so, when Gidon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he bowed down; and he returned into the camp of Yisra'el, and said, "Arise; for יהוה has delivered the army of Midian into your hand!"
\v 16 He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them shofars, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
\v 17 He said to them, "Watch me, and do likewise. Behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do.
\v 18 When I blow the shofar, I and all who are with me, then blow the shofars also on every side of all the camp, and shout, 'For יהוה and for Gidon!'"
\p
\v 19 So Gidon, and the hundred men who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the guards: and they blew the shofars, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
\v 20 The three companies blew the shofars, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the shofars in their right hands with which to blow; and they shouted, "The sword of יהוה and of Gidon!"
\v 21 They stood every man in his place around the camp; and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight.
\v 22 They blew the three hundred shofars, and יהוה set every man's sword against his fellow, and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Tsererah, as far as the border of Abel-Meḥolah, by Tabbath.
\v 23 The men of Yisra'el were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Menasheh, and pursued after Midian.
\p
\v 24 Gidon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephrayim, saying, "Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Yarden!" So all the men of Ephrayim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Yarden.
\v 25 They took the two princes of Midian, Orev and Zeev; and they killed Orev at the rock of Orev, and Zeev they killed at the winepress of Zeev, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Orev and Zeev to Gidon beyond the Yarden.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 The men of Ephrayim said to him, "Why have you treated us this way, that you did not call us, when you went to fight with Midian?" They rebuked him sharply.
\v 2 He said to them, "What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephrayim better than the vintage of Aviezer?
\v 3 Elohim has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Orev and Zeev! What was I able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
\p
\v 4 Gidon came to the Yarden, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
\v 5 He said to the men of Sukkoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna, the kings of Midian."
\v 6 The princes of Sukkoth said, "Are the palms of Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?"
\v 7 Gidon said, "Therefore when יהוה has delivered Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
\v 8 He went up there to Penu'el, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penu'el answered him as the men of Sukkoth had answered.
\v 9 He spoke also to the men of Penu'el, saying, "When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
\p
\v 10 Now Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword.
\v 11 Gidon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Novaḥ and Yogbehah, and struck the army, for the army was secure.
\v 12 Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna, and confused all the army.
\p
\v 13 Gidon the son of Yoash returned from the battle from the ascent of Ḥeres.
\v 14 He caught a young man of the men of Sukkoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Sukkoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men.
\v 15 He came to the men of Sukkoth, and said, "See Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the palms of Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?'"
\v 16 He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Sukkoth.
\v 17 He broke down the tower of Penu'el, and killed the men of the city.
\p
\v 18 Then he said to Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna, "What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tavor?" They answered, "They were like you. Each one resembled the children of a king."
\v 19 He said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As יהוה lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you."
\v 20 He said to Yether his firstborn, "Get up, and kill them!" But the youth did not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.
\v 21 Then Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna said, "Rise and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength." Gidon arose, and killed Zevaḥ and Tsalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
\p
\v 22 Then the men of Yisra'el said to Gidon, "Rule over us, both you, and your son, and your son's son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian."
\v 23 Gidon said to them, "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. יהוה shall rule over you."
\v 24 Gidon said to them, "I would make a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil." (For they had golden earrings, because they were Yishma'elites.)
\v 25 They answered, "We will willingly give them." They spread a garment, and every man threw the earrings of his spoil into it.
\v 26 The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred sheqels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks.
\v 27 Gidon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Yisra'el whored after it there; and it became a snare to Gidon, and to his house.
\p
\v 28 So Midian was subdued before the children of Yisra'el, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land had rest forty years in the days of Gidon.
\p
\v 29 Yerubba'al the son of Yoash went and lived in his own house.
\v 30 Gidon had seventy sons conceived from his body; for he had many wives.
\v 31 His concubine who was in Shekhem, she also bore him a son, and he named him Avimelekh.
\p
\v 32 Gidon the son of Yoash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Yoash his father, in Ophrah of the Aviezrites.
\p
\v 33 It happened, as soon as Gidon was dead, that the children of Yisra'el turned again, and whored after the Ba'als, and made Ba'al Berith their el.
\v 34 The children of Yisra'el did not remember יהוה their Elohim, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;
\v 35 neither did they show loving-kindness to the house of Yerubba'al, who is Gidon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Yisra'el.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Avimelekh the son of Yerubba'al went to Shekhem to his mother's brothers, and spoke with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
\v 2 "Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shekhem, 'Is it better for you that all the sons of Yerubba'al, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?' Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh."
\v 3 His mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shekhem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Avimelekh; for they said, "He is our brother."
\v 4 They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Ba'al Berith, with which Avimelekh hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.
\v 5 He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Yerubba'al, being seventy persons, on one stone: but Yotham the youngest son of Yerubba'al was left; for he hid himself.
\v 6 All the men of Shekhem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Avimelekh king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shekhem.
\p
\v 7 When they told it to Yotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said to them, "Listen to me, you men of Shekhem, that Elohim may listen to you.
\v 8 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.'
\v 9 But the olive tree said to them, 'Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor Elohim and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'
\v 10 "The trees said to the fig tree, 'Come and reign over us.'
\v 11 "But the fig tree said to them, 'Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'
\v 12 The trees said to the vine, 'Come and reign over us.'
\v 13 "The vine said to them, 'Should I leave my new wine, which cheers Elohim and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'
\v 14 Then all the trees said to the bramble, 'Come and reign over us.'
\v 15 "The bramble said to the trees, 'If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Levanon.'
\p
\v 16 "Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made Avimelekh king, and if you have dealt well with Yerubba'al and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands
\v 17 (for my father fought for you, and risked his being, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
\v 18 and you have risen up against my father's house today, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone, and have made Avimelekh, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shekhem, because he is your brother);
\v 19 if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Yerubba'al and with his house today, then rejoice in Avimelekh, and let him also rejoice in you:
\v 20 but if not, let fire come out from Avimelekh, and devour the men of Shekhem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shekhem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Avimelekh."
\v 21 Yotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there, for fear of Avimelekh his brother.
\p
\v 22 Avimelekh was prince over Yisra'el three years.
\v 23 Elohim sent an evil spirit between Avimelekh and the men of Shekhem; and the men of Shekhem dealt deceitfully with Avimelekh:
\v 24 that the violence done to the seventy sons of Yerubba'al might come, and that their blood might be laid on Avimelekh their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shekhem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
\v 25 The men of Shekhem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them: and it was told Avimelekh.
\p
\v 26 Ga'al the son of Eved came with his brothers, and went over to Shekhem; and the men of Shekhem relied on him.
\v 27 They went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and made celebration, and went into the house of their el, and did eat and drink, and cursed Avimelekh.
\v 28 Ga'al the son of Eved said, "Who is Avimelekh, and who is Shekhem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Yerubba'al? And Zevul his officer? Serve the men of Ḥamor the father of Shekhem: but why should we serve him?
\v 29 Would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Avimelekh." He said to Avimelekh, "Increase your army, and come out!"
\p
\v 30 When Zevul the ruler of the city heard the words of Ga'al the son of Eved, his anger was kindled.
\v 31 He sent messengers to Avimelekh craftily, saying, "Behold, Ga'al the son of Eved and his brothers are come to Shekhem; and behold, they constrain the city to take part against you.
\v 32 Now therefore, go up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field:
\v 33 and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and rush on the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion."
\p
\v 34 Avimelekh rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shekhem in four companies.
\v 35 Ga'al the son of Eved went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Avimelekh rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambush.
\v 36 When Ga'al saw the people, he said to Zevul, "Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains." Zevul said to him, "You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men."
\v 37 Ga'al spoke again and said, "Behold, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim."
\v 38 Then Zevul said to him, "Now where is your mouth, that you said, 'Who is Avimelekh, that we should serve him?' Is this not the people that you have despised? Please go out now and fight with them."
\v 39 Ga'al went out before the men of Shekhem, and fought with Avimelekh.
\v 40 Avimelekh chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
\v 41 Avimelekh lived at Arumah: and Zevul drove out Ga'al and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shekhem.
\p
\v 42 It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Avimelekh.
\v 43 He took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came forth out of the city; he rose up against them, and struck them.
\v 44 Avimelekh, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field, and struck them.
\v 45 Avimelekh fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and killed the people who were therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
\p
\v 46 When all the men of the tower of Shekhem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
\v 47 It was told Avimelekh that all the men of the tower of Shekhem were gathered together.
\v 48 Avimelekh went up to Mount Tsalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Avimelekh took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said to the people who were with him, "What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done!"
\v 49 All the people likewise each cut down his bough, and followed Avimelekh, and put them at the base of the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the people of the tower of Shekhem died also, about a thousand men and women.
\p
\v 50 Then went Avimelekh to Thevets, and encamped against Thevets, and took it.
\v 51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower.
\v 52 Avimelekh came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
\v 53 A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Avimelekh's head, and broke his skull.
\v 54 Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, "Draw your sword, and kill me, that men not say of me, 'A woman killed him.' His young man thrust him through, and he died."
\v 55 When the men of Yisra'el saw that Avimelekh was dead, they departed every man to his place.
\p
\v 56 Thus Elohim requited the evil of Avimelekh, which he did to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;
\v 57 and all the evil of the men of Shekhem did Elohim requite on their heads: and on them came the curse of Yotham the son of Yerubba'al.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 After Avimelekh there arose to save Yisra'el Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Yissakhar; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephrayim.
\v 2 He judged Yisra'el twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
\p
\v 3 After him arose Yair, the Giladite; and he judged Yisra'el twenty-two years.
\v 4 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Ḥavvoth Yair to this day, which are in the land of Gilad.
\v 5 Yair died, and was buried in Qamon.
\p
\v 6 The children of Yisra'el again did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, and served the Ba'als, and the Ashtaroth, and the elohim of Aram, and the elohim of Tsidon, and the elohim of Moav, and the elohim of the children of Ammon, and the elohim of the Philistines; and they forsook יהוה, and did not serve Him.
\v 7 The anger of יהוה was kindled against Yisra'el, and He sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
\v 8 They troubled and oppressed the children of Yisra'el that year: eighteen years they oppressed all the children of Yisra'el that were beyond the Yarden in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilad.
\v 9 The children of Ammon passed over the Yarden to fight also against Yehudah, and against Benyamin, and against the house of Ephrayim; so that Yisra'el was very distressed.
\p
\v 10 The children of Yisra'el cried to יהוה, saying, "We have sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our Elohim, and have served the Ba'als."
\v 11 יהוה said to the children of Yisra'el, "Did I not save you from the Mitsrites, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\v 12 The Tsidonians also, and the Amaleqites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
\v 13 Yet you have forsaken Me, and served other elohim: therefore I will save you no more.
\v 14 Go and cry to the elohim which you have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress!"
\v 15 The children of Yisra'el said to יהוה, "We have sinned: do to us whatever seems good in Your eyes; only deliver us, please, today."
\v 16 They put away the foreign elohim from among them, and served יהוה; and His being was grieved for the toil of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilad. The children of Yisra'el assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mitspah.
\v 18 The people, the princes of Gilad, said one to another, "What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilad."
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now Yiphthaḥ the Giladite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a whore: and Gilad brought forth Yiphthaḥ.
\v 2 Gilad's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove out Yiphthaḥ, and said to him, "You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman."
\v 3 Then Yiphthaḥ fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tov: and there were gathered worthless men to Yiphthaḥ, and they went out with him.
\p
\v 4 It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Yisra'el.
\v 5 It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Yisra'el, the elders of Gilad went to get Yiphthaḥ out of the land of Tov;
\v 6 and they said to Yiphthaḥ, "Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon."
\v 7 Yiphthaḥ said to the elders of Gilad, "Did you not hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?"
\v 8 The elders of Gilad said to Yiphthaḥ, "Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilad."
\v 9 Yiphthaḥ said to the elders of Gilad, "If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and יהוה deliver them before me, shall I be your head?"
\v 10 The elders of Gilad said to Yiphthaḥ, "יהוה shall be witness between us; surely according to your word so will we do."
\v 11 Then Yiphthaḥ went with the elders of Gilad, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Yiphthaḥ spoke all his words before יהוה in Mitspah.
\p
\v 12 Yiphthaḥ sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, "What have you to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?"
\v 13 The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Yiphthaḥ, "Because Yisra'el took away my land, when he came up out of Mitsrayim, from the Arnon even to the Yabboq, and to the Yarden: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably."
\v 14 Yiphthaḥ sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;
\v 15 and he said to him, "Thus says Yiphthaḥ: Yisra'el did not take away the land of Moav, nor the land of the children of Ammon,
\v 16 but when they came up from Mitsrayim, and Yisra'el went through the wilderness to the Sea of Reeds, and came to Qadesh;
\v 17 then Yisra'el sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let me pass through your land;' but the king of Edom did not listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moav; but he would not: and Yisra'el stayed in Qadesh.
\v 18 Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moav, and came by the east side of the land of Moav, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they did not come within the border of Moav, for the Arnon was the border of Moav.
\v 19 Yisra'el sent messengers to Siḥon king of the Amorites, the king of Ḥeshbon; and Yisra'el said to him, 'Please let us pass through your land to my place.'
\v 20 But Siḥon did not trust Yisra'el, to pass through his border; but Siḥon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Yahats, and fought against Yisra'el.
\v 21 יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, delivered Siḥon and all his people into the hand of Yisra'el, and they struck them: so Yisra'el possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
\v 22 They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Yabboq, and from the wilderness even to the Yarden.
\v 23 So now יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, has dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Yisra'el, and should you possess them?
\v 24 Will you not possess that which Kemosh your el gives you to possess? So whoever יהוה our Elohim has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
\v 25 Now are you anything better than Balaq the son of Tsippor, king of Moav? Did he ever strive against Yisra'el, or did he ever fight against them?
\v 26 While Yisra'el lived in Ḥeshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why did you not recover them within that time?
\v 27 I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. יהוה, the Judge, judge today between the children of Yisra'el and the children of Ammon."
\v 28 However the king of the children of Ammon did not listen to the words of Yiphthaḥ which he sent him.
\p
\v 29 Then the Ruaḥ of יהוה came on Yiphthaḥ, and he passed over Gilad and Menasheh, and passed over Mitspeh of Gilad, and from Mitspeh of Gilad he passed over to the children of Ammon.
\v 30 Yiphthaḥ vowed a vow to יהוה, and said, "If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
\v 31 then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall belong to יהוה, and I will offer it up for an ascension offering."
\v 32 So Yiphthaḥ passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and יהוה delivered them into his hand.
\v 33 He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelkeramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 34 Yiphthaḥ came to Mitspah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
\v 35 It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to יהוה, and I cannot go back."
\v 36 She said to him, "My father, you have opened your mouth to יהוה; do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because יהוה has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon."
\v 37 She said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two new moons, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions."
\v 38 He said, "Go." He sent her away for two new moons: and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her virginity on the mountains.
\v 39 It happened at the end of two new moons, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she did not know a man. It was a custom in Yisra'el,
\v 40 that the daughters of Yisra'el went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Yiphthaḥ the Giladite four days in a year.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 The men of Ephrayim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Yiphthaḥ, "Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house around you with fire!"
\v 2 Yiphthaḥ said to them, "I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not save me out of their hand.
\v 3 When I saw that you did not save me, I put my being in my palms, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and יהוה delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me today, to fight against me?"
\v 4 Then Yiphthaḥ gathered together all the men of Gilad, and fought with Ephrayim; and the men of Gilad struck Ephrayim, because they said, "You are fugitives of Ephrayim, you Giladites, in the midst of Ephrayim, and in the midst of Menasheh."
\v 5 The Giladites took the fords of the Yarden against the Ephrayimites. It was so, that when the fugitives of Ephrayim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilad said to him, "Are you an Ephrayimite?" If he said, "No;"
\v 6 then they said to him, "Now say 'Shibboleth;'" and he said "Sibboleth;" for he could not manage to pronounce it right: then they laid hold of him, and killed him at the fords of the Yarden. At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephrayim fell.
\p
\v 7 Yiphthaḥ judged Yisra'el six years. Then died Yiphthaḥ the Giladite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilad.
\p
\v 8 After him Ivtsan of Beth-leḥem judged Yisra'el.
\v 9 He had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. He judged Yisra'el seven years.
\v 10 Ivtsan died, and was buried at Beth-leḥem.
\p
\v 11 After him Elon the Zevulunite judged Yisra'el; and he judged Yisra'el ten years.
\v 12 Elon the Zevulunite died, and was buried in Aiyalon in the land of Zevulun.
\p
\v 13 After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Yisra'el.
\v 14 He had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, who rode on seventy donkey colts: and he judged Yisra'el eight years.
\v 15 Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephrayim, in the hill country of the Amaleqites.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 The children of Yisra'el again did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה; and יהוה delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
\p
\v 2 There was a certain man of Tsorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoaḥ; and his wife was barren, and did not bear.
\v 3 The messenger of יהוה appeared to the woman, and said to her, "See now, you are barren, and do not bear; but you shall conceive, and bear a son.
\v 4 Now therefore please be on guard and drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing:
\v 5 for, behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head; for the child shall be separated to Elohim from the womb: and he shall begin to save Yisra'el out of the hand of the Philistines."
\v 6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A man of Elohim came to me, and his face was like the face of the messenger of Elohim, very awesome; and I did not ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name:
\v 7 but he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be separated to Elohim from the womb to the day of his death.'"
\p
\v 8 Then Manoaḥ entreated יהוה, and said, "Oh, יהוה, please let the man of Elohim whom You did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born."
\v 9 Elohim listened to the voice of Manoaḥ; and the messenger of Elohim came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoaḥ, her husband, was not with her.
\v 10 The woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, "Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me the other day."
\v 11 Manoaḥ arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to the woman?" He said, "I am."
\v 12 Manoaḥ said, "Now let your words happen. What shall be the judgment of the child, and what shall we do to him?"
\v 13 The messenger of יהוה said to Manoaḥ, "Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.
\v 14 She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe."
\p
\v 15 Manoaḥ said to the messenger of יהוה, "Please, let us detain you, that we may make a young goat ready for you."
\v 16 The messenger of יהוה said to Manoaḥ, "Though you detain me, I will not eat of your bread; and if you will prepare an ascension offering, you must offer it to יהוה." For Manoaḥ did not know that he was the messenger of יהוה.
\v 17 Manoaḥ said to the messenger of יהוה, "What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?"
\v 18 The messenger of יהוה said to him, "Why do you ask about my name, since it is wonderful?"
\v 19 So Manoaḥ took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to יהוה: and the messenger did wondrously, and Manoaḥ and his wife looked on.
\v 20 For it happened, when the flame went up toward the heavens from off the altar, that the messenger of יהוה ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoaḥ and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
\p
\v 21 But the messenger of יהוה did no more appear to Manoaḥ or to his wife. Then Manoaḥ knew that he was the messenger of יהוה.
\v 22 Manoaḥ said to his wife, "We shall surely die, because we have seen Elohim."
\v 23 But his wife said to him, "If יהוה were pleased to kill us, he would not have received an ascension offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these."
\p
\v 24 The woman brought forth a son, and named him Shimshon: and the child grew, and יהוה blessed him.
\v 25 The Ruaḥ of יהוה began to move him in Maḥaneh Dan, between Tsorah and Eshtaol.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Shimshon went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
\v 2 He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, "I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me as wife."
\v 3 Then his father and his mother said to him, "Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?" Shimshon said to his father, "Get her for me; for she pleases me well."
\v 4 But his father and his mother did not know that it was of יהוה; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Yisra'el.
\p
\v 5 Then went Shimshon down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and behold, a young lion roared against him.
\v 6 The Ruaḥ of יהוה came mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat; and he had nothing in his hand: but he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
\v 7 He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Shimshon well.
\p
\v 8 After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
\v 9 He took it into his palms, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate: but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.
\p
\v 10 His father went down to the woman: and Shimshon made there a banquet; for so used the young men to do.
\v 11 It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
\p
\v 12 Shimshon said to them, "Let me tell you a riddle now. If you can declare it to me within the seven days of the banquet, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;
\v 13 but if you cannot declare it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing." They said to him, "Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it."
\p
\v 14 He said to them, "Out of the eater came forth food. Out of the strong came forth sweetness." They could not in three days declare the riddle.
\p
\v 15 It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Shimshon's wife, "Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Is it not so?"
\v 16 Shimshon's wife wept before him, and said, "You just hate me, and do not love me. You have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and have not told it me." He said to her, "Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?"
\v 17 She wept before him the seven days, while their banquet lasted: and it came about on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
\p
\v 18 The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" He said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle."
\p
\v 19 The Ruaḥ of יהוה came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashqelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of clothing to those who declared the riddle. His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
\v 20 But Shimshon's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 But it happened after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Shimshon visited his wife with a young goat; and he said, "I will go in to my wife into the room." But her father would not allow him to go in.
\v 2 Her father said, "I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her, instead."
\p
\v 3 Shimshon said to them, "This time I will be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I harm them."
\v 4 Shimshon went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between every two tails.
\v 5 When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
\v 6 Then the Philistines said, "Who has done this?" They said, "Shimshon, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion." The Philistines came up, and burned her and her father with fire.
\v 7 Shimshon said to them, "If you behave like this, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."
\v 8 He struck them hip on thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
\p
\v 9 Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Yehudah, and spread themselves in Leḥi.
\v 10 The men of Yehudah said, "Why have you come up against us?" They said, "We have come up to bind Shimshon, to do to him as he has done to us."
\v 11 Then three thousand men of Yehudah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Shimshon, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" He said to them, "As they did to me, so have I done to them."
\v 12 They said to him, "We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines." Shimshon said to them, "Swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves."
\v 13 They spoke to him, saying, "No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand; but surely we will not kill you." They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
\p
\v 14 When he came to Leḥi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Ruaḥ of יהוה came mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that was burned with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.
\v 15 He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put forth his hand, and took it, and struck a thousand men therewith.
\p
\v 16 Shimshon said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men."
\p
\v 17 And it came about, when he finished speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Leḥi.
\v 18 He was very thirsty, and called on יהוה, and said, "You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"
\v 19 But Elohim split the hollow place that is in Leḥi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which is in Leḥi, to this day.
\v 20 He judged Yisra'el in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Shimshon went to Gaza, and saw there a whore, and went in to her.
\v 2 It was told the Gazites, saying, "Shimshon is here!" They surrounded him, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, Let be until morning light, then we will kill him.
\v 3 Shimshon lay until midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Ḥevron.
\p
\v 4 It came about afterward, that he loved a woman in the wadi of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
\v 5 The chiefs of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, "Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."
\v 6 Delilah said to Shimshon, "Please tell me where your great strength lies, and what you might be bound to afflict you."
\v 7 Shimshon said to her, "If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."
\v 8 Then the chiefs of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
\v 9 Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner room. She said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Shimshon!" He broke the cords, as a thread of wick is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.
\p
\v 10 Delilah said to Shimshon, "Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now please tell me with which you might be bound."
\v 11 He said to her, "If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."
\v 12 So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Shimshon!" The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a thread.
\p
\v 13 Delilah said to Shimshon, "Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you might be bound." He said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web."
\v 14 She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Shimshon!" He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.
\p
\v 15 She said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies."
\v 16 It happened, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his being was troubled to death.
\v 17 He told her all his heart, and said to her, "No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been separated to Elohim from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak, and be like any other man."
\p
\v 18 When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the chiefs of the Philistines, saying, "Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart." Then the chiefs of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hand.
\v 19 She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
\v 20 She said, "The Philistines are upon you, Shimshon!" He awoke out of his sleep, and said, "I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free." But he did not know that יהוה had departed from him.
\v 21 The Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of copper; and he ground at the mill in the prison.
\v 22 However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.
\p
\v 23 The chiefs of the Philistines gathered them together to slaughter a great sacrifice to Dagon their el, and to rejoice; for they said, "Our el has delivered Shimshon our enemy into our hand."
\p
\v 24 When the people saw him, they praised their el; for they said, "Our el has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand."
\p
\v 25 It happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said, "Call for Shimshon, that he may entertain us." They called for Shimshon out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him between the pillars;
\v 26 and Shimshon said to the boy who held him by the hand, "Allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests, that I may lean on them."
\v 27 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the chiefs of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Shimshon performed.
\p
\v 28 Shimshon called to יהוה, and said, "Adonai יהוה, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, only this once, Elohim, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."
\v 29 Shimshon took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and leaned on them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.
\v 30 Shimshon said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the chiefs, and on all the people who were therein. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life.
\v 31 Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Tsorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoaḥ his father. He judged Yisra'el twenty years.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 There was a man of the hill country of Ephrayim, whose name was Mikhah.
\v 2 He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." His mother said, "Blessed be my son of יהוה."
\v 3 He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, "I most certainly dedicate the silver to יהוה from my hand for my son, to make an engraved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you."
\v 4 When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it an engraved image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Mikhah.
\v 5 The man Mikhah had a house of elohim, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and set apart one of his sons, who became his priest.
\v 6 In those days there was no king in Yisra'el: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
\p
\v 7 There was a young man out of Beth-leḥem Yehudah, of the family of Yehudah, who was a Levite; and he lived there.
\v 8 The man departed out of the city, out of Beth-leḥem Yehudah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephrayim to the house of Mikhah, as he traveled.
\v 9 Mikhah said to him, "Where did you come from?" He said to him, "I am a Levite of Beth-leḥem Yehudah, and I am looking for a place to live."
\v 10 Mikhah said to him, "Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food." So the Levite went in.
\v 11 The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.
\v 12 Mikhah set the Levite apart, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Mikhah.
\v 13 Then Mikhah said, "Now know I that יהוה will do good to me, since I have a Levite to my priest."
\c 18
\p
\v 1 In those days there was no king in Yisra'el: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Yisra'el.
\v 2 The children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Tsorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, "Go, explore the land!" They came to the hill country of Ephrayim, to the house of Mikhah, and lodged there.
\v 3 When they were by the house of Mikhah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to him, "Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?"
\v 4 He said to them, "Thus and thus has Mikhah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I am become his priest."
\v 5 They said to him, "Please ask counsel of Elohim, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."
\v 6 The priest said to them, "Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before יהוה."
\p
\v 7 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were therein, how they lived in security, after the judgment of the Tsidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Tsidonians, and had no dealings with any man.
\v 8 They came to their brothers to Tsorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, "What do you say?"
\v 9 They said, "Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Do you stand still? Do not be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
\v 10 When you go, you shall come to a secure people, and the land is large; for Elohim has given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth."
\p
\v 11 There set forth from there of the family of the Danites, out of Tsorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
\v 12 They went up, and encamped in Qiryath Yearim, in Yehudah: therefore they called that place Maḥaneh Dan, to this day; behold, it is behind Qiryath Yearim.
\v 13 They passed there to the hill country of Ephrayim, and came to the house of Mikhah.
\p
\v 14 Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, "Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do."
\v 15 They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Mikhah, and asked him of his welfare.
\v 16 The six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
\v 17 The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
\v 18 When these went into Mikhah's house, and fetched the engraved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"
\v 19 They said to him, "Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Yisra'el?"
\v 20 The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people.
\p
\v 21 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them.
\v 22 When they were a good way from the house of Mikhah, the men who were in the houses near to Mikhah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
\v 23 They cried to the children of Dan. They turned their faces, and said to Mikhah, "What ails you, that you come with such a company?"
\v 24 He said, "You have taken away my elohim which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what more do I have? How then do you say to me, 'What ails you?'"
\v 25 The children of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your being, with the beings of your household."
\v 26 The children of Dan went their way: and when Mikhah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
\p
\v 27 They took that which Mikhah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burned the city with fire.
\v 28 There was no deliverer, because it was far from Tsidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Reḥov. They built the city, and lived therein.
\v 29 They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Yisra'el: however the name of the city was Laish at the first.
\v 30 The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image: and Yonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Mosheh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
\v 31 So they set them up Mikhah's engraved image which he made, all the time that the house of Elohim was in Shiloh.

\p
\v 1 It happened in those days, when there was no king in Yisra'el, that there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephrayim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-leḥem Yehudah.
\v 2 His concubine whored against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Beth-leḥem Yehudah, and was there the space of four new moons.
\v 3 Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak to her from his heart, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of donkeys: and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
\v 4 His father-in-law, the young lady's father, retained him; and he stayed with him three days: so they ate and drink, and lodged there.
\v 5 It happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the young lady's father said to his son-in-law, "Sustain your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way."
\v 6 So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together: and the young lady's father said to the man, "Please be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry."
\v 7 The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.
\v 8 He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady's father said, "Please sustain your heart and stay until the day declines;" and they both ate.
\v 9 When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady's father, said to him, "Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go on your way early, that you may go home."
\p
\v 10 But the man would not stay that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Yevus (the same is Yerushalyim): and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled; his concubine also was with him.
\v 11 When they were by Yevus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, "Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Yevusites, and lodge in it."
\v 12 His master said to him, "We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Yisra'el; but we will pass over to Givah."
\v 13 He said to his servant, "Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Givah, or in Ramah."
\v 14 So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near to Givah, which belongs to Benyamin.
\v 15 They turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Givah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge.
\p
\v 16 Behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening: now the man was of the hill country of Ephrayim, and he lived in Givah; but the men of the place were Benyamites.
\v 17 He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, "Where are you going? Where did you come from?"
\v 18 He said to him, "We are passing from Beth-leḥem Yehudah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephrayim. I am from there, and I went to Beth-leḥem Yehudah. I am going to the house of יהוה; and there is no man who takes me into his house.
\v 19 Yet there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servants: there is no want of anything."
\v 20 The old man said, "Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only do not lodge in the street."
\v 21 So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder; and they washed their feet, and ate and drink.
\p
\v 22 As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Beliyya'al, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, "Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him!"
\v 23 The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, "No, my brothers, please do not act so wickedly; since this man is come into my house, do not do this senseless thing.
\v 24 Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them what seems good in your eyes; but to this man do not do any such senseless thing."
\v 25 But the men would not listen to him: so the man laid hold of his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they knew her, and abused her all night until the morning: and when the day began to dawn, they let her go.
\v 26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her master was, until it was light.
\p
\v 27 Her master rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
\v 28 He said to her, "Get up, and let us be going!" but no one answered. Then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.
\v 29 When he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Yisra'el.
\v 30 It was so, that all who saw it said, "There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Yisra'el came up out of the land of Mitsrayim to this day! Consider it, take counsel, and speak."
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Then all the children of Yisra'el went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheva, with the land of Gilad, to יהוה at Mitspah.
\v 2 The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Yisra'el, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of Elohim, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.
\v 3 (Now the children of Benyamin heard that the children of Yisra'el had gone up to Mitspah.) The children of Yisra'el said, "Tell us, how did this evil happen?"
\v 4 The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, "I came into Givah that belongs to Benyamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
\v 5 The men of Givah rose against me, and surrounded the house by night. They thought to have slain me, and they forced my concubine, and she is dead.
\v 6 I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Yisra'el; for they have committed a lewd and senseless thing in Yisra'el.
\v 7 Behold, you children of Yisra'el, all of you, give here your advice and counsel."
\p
\v 8 All the people arose as one man, saying, "We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn to his house.
\v 9 But now this is the thing which we will do to Givah: we will go up against it by lot;
\v 10 and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Yisra'el, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Givah of Benyamin, according to all the senseless thing that they have worked in Yisra'el."
\v 11 So all the men of Yisra'el were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
\p
\v 12 The tribes of Yisra'el sent men through all the tribe of Benyamin, saying, "What evil is this that is happen among you?
\v 13 Now therefore deliver up the men, the sons of Beliyya'al, who are in Givah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Yisra'el." But Benyamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Yisra'el.
\v 14 The children of Benyamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Givah, to go out to battle against the children of Yisra'el.
\v 15 The children of Benyamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Givah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
\v 16 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss.
\p
\v 17 The men of Yisra'el, besides Benyamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword: all these were men of war.
\v 18 The children of Yisra'el arose, and went up to Beth-El, and asked counsel of Elohim; and they said, "Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benyamin?" יהוה said, "Yehudah shall go up first."
\p
\v 19 The children of Yisra'el rose up in the morning, and encamped against Givah.
\v 20 The men of Yisra'el went out to battle against Benyamin; and the men of Yisra'el set the battle in array against them at Givah.
\v 21 The children of Benyamin came forth out of Givah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Yisra'elites on that day twenty-two thousand men.
\v 22 The people, the men of Yisra'el, strengthened themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.
\v 23 The children of Yisra'el went up and wept before יהוה until evening; and they asked of יהוה, saying, "Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benyamin my brother?" יהוה said, "Go up against him."
\p
\v 24 The children of Yisra'el came near against the children of Benyamin the second day.
\v 25 Benyamin went forth against them out of Givah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Yisra'el again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
\v 26 Then all the children of Yisra'el, and all the people, went up, and came to Beth-El, and wept, and sat there before יהוה, and fasted that day until evening; and they offered ascension offerings and peace offerings before יהוה.
\v 27 The children of Yisra'el asked of יהוה (for the ark of the covenant of Elohim was there in those days,
\v 28 and Pineḥas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aharon, stood before it in those days), saying, "Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benyamin my brother, or shall I cease?" יהוה said, "Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand."
\p
\v 29 Yisra'el set ambushes all around Givah.
\v 30 The children of Yisra'el went up against the children of Benyamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Givah, as at other times.
\v 31 The children of Benyamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Beth-El, and the other to Givah, in the field, about thirty men of Yisra'el.
\v 32 The children of Benyamin said, "They are struck down before us, as at the first." But the children of Yisra'el said, "Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways."
\v 33 All the men of Yisra'el rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Ba'al Tamar: and the ambushers of Yisra'el broke forth out of their place, even out of Ma'areh Geva.
\v 34 There came over against Givah ten thousand chosen men out of all Yisra'el, and the battle was severe; but they did not know that evil was close on them.
\v 35 יהוה struck Benyamin before Yisra'el; and the children of Yisra'el destroyed of Benyamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.
\p
\v 36 So the children of Benyamin saw that they were struck; for the men of Yisra'el gave place to Benyamin, because they relied on the ambushers whom they had set against Givah.
\v 37 The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Givah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.
\v 38 Now the appointed sign between the men of Yisra'el and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.
\v 39 The men of Yisra'el turned in the battle, and Benyamin began to strike and kill of the men of Yisra'el about thirty persons; for they said, "Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle."
\v 40 But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benyamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to the heavens.
\v 41 The men of Yisra'el turned, and the men of Benyamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil had come on them.
\v 42 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Yisra'el to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst.
\v 43 They surrounded the Benyamites, chased them, and trod them down at their resting place, as far as over against Givah toward the sunrise.
\v 44 There fell of Benyamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.
\p
\v 45 They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them two thousand men.
\v 46 So that all who fell that day of Benyamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor.
\v 47 But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four new moons.
\v 48 The men of Yisra'el turned again on the children of Benyamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Now the men of Yisra'el had sworn in Mitspah, saying, "There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benyamin as wife."
\v 2 The people came to Beth-El, and sat there until evening before Elohim, and lifted up their voices, and wept severely.
\v 3 They said, "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, why has this happened in Yisra'el, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Yisra'el?"
\v 4 It happened on the next day that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered ascension offerings and peace offerings.
\p
\v 5 The children of Yisra'el said, "Who is there among all the tribes of Yisra'el who did not come up in the assembly to יהוה?" For they had made a great oath concerning him who did not come up to יהוה to Mitspah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death."
\v 6 The children of Yisra'el grieved for Benyamin their brother, and said, "There is one tribe cut off from Yisra'el today.
\v 7 How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by יהוה that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?"
\p
\v 8 They said, "What one is there of the tribes of Yisra'el who did not come up to יהוה to Mitspah?" Behold, there came none to the camp from Yavesh Gilad to the assembly.
\v 9 For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Yavesh Gilad there.
\v 10 The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Yavesh Gilad with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.
\v 11 This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain with a man."
\v 12 They found among the inhabitants of Yavesh Gilad four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Kena'an.
\p
\v 13 The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benyamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
\v 14 Benyamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Yavesh Gilad: and yet so they were not enough for them.
\v 15 The people grieved for Benyamin, because that יהוה had made a breach in the tribes of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 16 Then the elders of the congregation said, "How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since the women are destroyed out of Benyamin?"
\v 17 They said, "There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benyamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Yisra'el.
\v 18 However we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Yisra'el had sworn, saying, 'Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benyamin.'"
\p
\v 19 And they said, "Behold, the feast of יהוה in Shiloh from year to year, which is on the north of Beth-El, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Beth-El to Shekhem, and on the south of Levonah."
\v 20 Then they commanded the children of Benyamin, saying, "Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
\v 21 and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to take part in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benyamin.
\v 22 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, 'Grant them favorably to us, because we did not take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, otherwise you would now be guilty.'"
\p
\v 23 And the children of Benyamin did so, and took wives, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they seized. And they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelled in them.
\v 24 And the children of Yisra'el departed there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
\p
\v 25 In those days there was no king in Yisra'el: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
