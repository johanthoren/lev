\p
\v 1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Tsophim, of the hill country of Ephrayim, and his name was Elqanah, the son of Yeroḥam, the son of Elihu, the son of Toḥu, the son of Tsuph, an Ephrayimite:
\v 2 and he had two wives; the name of the one was Ḥannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Ḥannah had no children.
\p
\v 3 This man went up out of his city from year to year to bow down to and to slaughter to יהוה Tsevaot in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Pineḥas, priests to יהוה, were there.
\v 4 When the day came that Elqanah slaughtered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
\v 5 but to Ḥannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Ḥannah, but יהוה had closed up her womb.
\v 6 Her rival provoked her severely, to make her fret, because יהוה had closed up her womb.
\v 7 As he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of יהוה, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
\v 8 Elqanah her husband said to her, "Ḥannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
\p
\v 9 So Ḥannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the Temple of יהוה.
\v 10 She was in bitterness of being, and prayed to יהוה, and wept bitterly.
\v 11 She vowed a vow, and said, "יהוה Tsevaot, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Your handmaid, but will give to Your handmaid seed – a man –, then I will give him to יהוה all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head."
\p
\v 12 It happened, as she continued praying before יהוה, that Eli saw her mouth.
\v 13 Now Ḥannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
\v 14 Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from you."
\v 15 Ḥannah answered, "No, my master, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my being before יהוה.
\v 16 Do not count your handmaid for a worthless woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation."
\v 17 Then Eli answered, "Go in peace; and may the Elohim of Yisra'el grant your petition that you have asked of him."
\v 18 She said, "Let your handmaid find favor in your eyes." So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression was not sad any more.
\p
\v 19 They rose up in the morning early, and bowed down before יהוה, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elqanah knew Ḥannah his wife; and יהוה remembered her.
\v 20 It happened, when the time had come, that Ḥannah conceived, and brought forth a son; and she named him Shemu'el, saying, "Because I have asked him of יהוה."
\p
\v 21 The man Elqanah, and all his house, went up to slaughter to יהוה the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
\v 22 But Ḥannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, "Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before יהוה, and stay there forever."
\v 23 Elqanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems good in your eyes. Wait until you have weaned him; only may יהוה establish His word." So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.
\v 24 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of יהוה in Shiloh. The child was young.
\v 25 They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.
\v 26 She said, "Oh, my master, as your being lives, my master, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to יהוה.
\v 27 For this child I prayed; and יהוה has given me my petition which I asked of Him.
\v 28 Therefore also I have granted him to יהוה. As long as he lives he is granted to יהוה." He bowed down to יהוה there.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Ḥannah prayed, and said: "My heart exults in יהוה! My horn is exalted in יהוה. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies, because I rejoice in Your Salvation.
\p
\v 2 There is no one as set-apart as יהוה, for there is no one besides You, nor is there any rock like our Elohim.
\p
\v 3 "Talk no more so exceeding proudly. Let not arrogance come out of your mouth, for יהוה is an El of knowledge. By Him actions are weighed.
\p
\v 4 "The bows of the mighty men are broken. Those who stumbled are armed with strength.
\p
\v 5 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread. Those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. Yes, the barren has borne seven. She who has many children withers.
\p
\v 6 "יהוה kills, and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.
\p
\v 7 יהוה makes poor, and makes rich. He brings low, He also lifts up.
\p
\v 8 He raises up the poor out of the dust. He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth belong to יהוה. He has set the world on them.
\p
\v 9 He will guard the feet of His kind ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for no man shall prevail by strength.
\p
\v 10 Those who strive with יהוה shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in the heavens. "יהוה will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to His king, and exalt the horn of His anointed."
\p
\v 11 Elqanah went to Ramah to his house. The child did minister to יהוה before Eli the priest.
\p
\v 12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Beliyya'al; they did not know יהוה.
\v 13 The judgment of the priests with the people was that when any man slaughtered a sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was cooking, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;
\v 14 and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Yisra'elites who came there.
\v 15 Yes, before they burn the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who slaughtered, "Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept cooked meat from you, but raw."
\v 16 If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your being desires;" then he would say, "No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force."
\v 17 The sin of the young men was very great before יהוה; for the men despised the offering of יהוה.
\p
\v 18 But Shemu'el ministered before יהוה, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.
\v 19 Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to slaughter the yearly sacrifice.
\v 20 Eli blessed Elqanah and his wife, and said, "May יהוה give you seed of this woman for the request which was asked of יהוה." They went to their own home.
\p
\v 21 יהוה visited Ḥannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Shemu'el grew before יהוה.
\p
\v 22 Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Yisra'el, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 23 He said to them, "Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
\v 24 No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the people of יהוה disobey.
\v 25 If one man sin against another, Elohim shall judge him; but if a man sin against יהוה, who shall entreat for him?" Notwithstanding, they did not listen to the voice of their father, because יהוה was minded to kill them.
\p
\v 26 The child Shemu'el grew on, and increased in favor both with יהוה, and also with men.
\p
\v 27 A man of Elohim came to Eli, and said to him, "Thus says יהוה, 'Did I reveal Myself to the house of your father, when they were in Mitsrayim in bondage to Pharaoh's house?
\v 28 Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Yisra'el to be My priest, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? Did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Yisra'el made by fire?
\v 29 Why do you kick at My sacrifice and at My offering, which I have commanded in My habitation, and honor your sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Yisra'el My people?'
\v 30 Therefore יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says, 'I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before Me forever.' But now יהוה says, 'Be it far from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.
\v 31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.
\v 32 You shall see the affliction of My habitation, in all that which Elohim shall give Yisra'el; and there shall not be an old man in your house for the days.
\v 33 The man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from My altar, shall be to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.
\v 34 This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Pineḥas: in one day they shall both die.
\v 35 I will raise up a faithful priest to Me, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and in My being. I will build him a faithful house; and he shall walk before My anointed forever.
\v 36 It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, "Please put me into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread."'"
\c 3
\p
\v 1 The child Shemu'el ministered to יהוה before Eli. The word of יהוה was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.
\p
\v 2 It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),
\v 3 and the lamp of Elohim had not yet gone out, and Shemu'el had laid down to sleep in the Temple of יהוה, where the ark of Elohim was;
\v 4 that יהוה called Shemu'el; and he said, "Here I am."
\v 5 He ran to Eli, and said, "Here I am; for you called me." He said, "I did not call; lie down again." He went and lay down.
\v 6 יהוה called yet again, "Shemu'el!" Shemu'el arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; for you called me." He answered, "I did not call, my son; lie down again."
\v 7 Now Shemu'el did not yet know יהוה, neither was the word of יהוה yet revealed to him.
\v 8 יהוה called Shemu'el again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; for you called me." Eli perceived that יהוה had called the child.
\v 9 Therefore Eli said to Shemu'el, "Go, lie down: and it shall be, if He calls you, that you shall say, 'Speak, יהוה; for Your servant hears.'" So Shemu'el went and lay down in his place.
\p
\v 10 יהוה came, and stood, and called as at other times, "Shemu'el! Shemu'el!" Then Shemu'el said, "Speak; for Your servant hears."
\v 11 יהוה said to Shemu'el, "Behold, I will do a thing in Yisra'el, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.
\v 12 In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.
\v 13 For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he did not restrain them.
\v 14 Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for with sacrifice or offering forever."
\p
\v 15 Shemu'el lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of יהוה. Shemu'el feared to show Eli the vision.
\v 16 Then Eli called Shemu'el, and said, "Shemu'el, my son!" He said, "Here I am."
\v 17 He said, "What is the thing that He has spoken to you? Please do not hide it from me. Elohim do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that He spoke to you."
\v 18 Shemu'el told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. He said, "It is יהוה. Let Him do what seems good to Him."
\p
\v 19 Shemu'el grew, and יהוה was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.
\v 20 All Yisra'el from Dan even to Beersheva knew that Shemu'el was a faithful prophet to יהוה.
\v 21 יהוה appeared again in Shiloh; for יהוה revealed Himself to Shemu'el in Shiloh by the word of יהוה.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 The word of Shemu'el came to all Yisra'el. Now Yisra'el went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Even Haezer: and the Philistines encamped in Apheq.
\v 2 The Philistines put themselves in array against Yisra'el: and when they joined battle, Yisra'el was struck before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.
\v 3 When the people were come into the camp, the elders of Yisra'el said, "Why has יהוה struck us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of the covenant of יהוה out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the palm of our enemies."
\v 4 So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of יהוה Tsevaot, who sits above the keruvim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Pineḥas, were there with the ark of the covenant of Elohim.
\p
\v 5 When the ark of the covenant of יהוה came into the camp, all Yisra'el shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
\v 6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, "What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" They understood that the ark of יהוה had come into the camp.
\v 7 The Philistines were afraid, for they said, "Elohim has come into the camp." They said, "Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.
\v 8 Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Elohim? These are the Elohim that struck the Mitsrites with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
\v 9 Be strong, and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!"
\p
\v 10 The Philistines fought, and Yisra'el was struck, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Yisra'el thirty thousand footmen.
\v 11 The ark of Elohim was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Pineḥas, were slain.
\p
\v 12 There ran a man of Benyamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head.
\v 13 When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of Elohim. When the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
\v 14 When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, "What does the noise of this tumult mean?" The man hurried, and came and told Eli.
\v 15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.
\v 16 The man said to Eli, "I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army." He said, "How did the matter go, my son?"
\v 17 He who brought the news answered, "Yisra'el has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Pineḥas, are dead, and the ark of Elohim has been captured."
\v 18 It happened, when he made mention of the ark of Elohim, that Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Yisra'el forty years.
\p
\v 19 His daughter-in-law, Pineḥas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered. When she heard the news that the ark of Elohim was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came on her.
\v 20 About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, "Do not be afraid; for you have brought forth a son." But she did not answer, neither did she set her heart to it.
\v 21 She named the child I-Kavod, saying, "The glory has departed from Yisra'el;" because the ark of Elohim was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
\v 22 She said, "The glory has departed from Yisra'el; for the ark of Elohim is taken."
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines had taken the ark of Elohim, and they brought it from Even Haezer to Ashdod.
\v 2 The Philistines took the ark of Elohim, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
\v 3 When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of יהוה. They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
\v 4 When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of יהוה; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off on the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
\v 5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.
\p
\v 6 But the Hand of יהוה was heavy on them of Ashdod, and He destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod and its borders.
\v 7 When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, "The ark of the Elohim of Yisra'el shall not stay with us; for His hand is severe on us, and on Dagon our el."
\v 8 They sent therefore and gathered all the chiefs of the Philistines to them, and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the Elohim of Yisra'el?" They answered, "Let the ark of the Elohim of Yisra'el be carried over to Gath." They carried the ark of the Elohim of Yisra'el there.
\v 9 It was so, that after they had carried it about, the Hand of יהוה was against the city with a very great confusion: and He struck the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors broke out on them.
\v 10 So they sent the ark of Elohim to Eqron. It happened, as the ark of Elohim came to Eqron, that the Eqronites cried out, saying, "They have brought about the ark of the Elohim of Yisra'el to us, to kill us and our people."
\v 11 They sent therefore and gathered together all the chiefs of the Philistines, and they said, "Send away the ark of the Elohim of Yisra'el, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people." For there was a deadly confusion throughout all the city; the Hand of Elohim was very heavy there.
\v 12 The men who did not die were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to the heavens.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 The ark of יהוה was in the country of the Philistines seven new moons.
\v 2 The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, "What shall we do with the ark of יהוה? Show us with which we shall send it to its place."
\v 3 They said, "If you send away the ark of the Elohim of Yisra'el, do not send it empty; but by all means return Him a guilt offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why His hand is not removed from you."
\v 4 Then they said, "What shall be the guilt offering which we shall return to Him?" They said, "Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the chiefs of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your chiefs.
\v 5 Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the Elohim of Yisra'el: perhaps He will lighten His hand from off you, and from off your elohim, and from off your land.
\v 6 Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Mitsrites and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had worked wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
\p
\v 7 "Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart, and two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke; and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;
\v 8 and take the ark of יהוה, and lay it on the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which you return Him for a guilt offering, in a coffer by its side; and send it away, that it may go.
\v 9 Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then He has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not His hand that struck us; it was a chance that happened to us."
\p
\v 10 The men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and closed up their calves at home;
\v 11 and they put the ark of יהוה on the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
\v 12 The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left; and the chiefs of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.
\p
\v 13 They of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
\v 14 The cart came into the field of Yehoshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for an ascension offering to יהוה.
\v 15 The Levites took down the ark of יהוה, and the coffer that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth Shemesh offered ascension offerings and slaughtered sacrifices the same day to יהוה.
\v 16 When the five chiefs of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Eqron the same day.
\p
\v 17 These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering to יהוה: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashqelon one, for Gath one, for Eqron one;
\v 18 and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five chiefs, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of יהוה, which stone remains to this day in the field of Yehoshua of Beth Shemesh.
\p
\v 19 He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of יהוה, He struck of the people fifty thousand seventy men; and the people mourned, because יהוה had struck the people with a great slaughter.
\v 20 The men of Beth Shemesh said, "Who is able to stand before יהוה, this set-apart Elohim? To whom shall He go up from us?"
\v 21 They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Qiryath Yearim, saying, "The Philistines have brought back the ark of יהוה; come down, and bring it up to yourselves."
\c 7
\p
\v 1 The men of Qiryath Yearim came, and fetched up the ark of יהוה, and brought it into the house of Avinadav in the hill, and set apart Elazar his son to guard the ark of יהוה.
\v 2 It happened, from the day that the ark stayed in Qiryath Yearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Yisra'el lamented after יהוה.
\p
\v 3 Shemu'el spoke to all the house of Yisra'el, saying, "If you do return to יהוה with all your heart, then put away the foreign elohim and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to יהוה, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
\v 4 Then the children of Yisra'el did put away the Ba'als and the Ashtaroth, and served יהוה only.
\p
\v 5 Shemu'el said, "Gather all Yisra'el to Mitspah, and I will pray for you to יהוה."
\v 6 They gathered together to Mitspah, and drew water, and poured it out before יהוה, and fasted on that day, and said there, "We have sinned against יהוה." Shemu'el judged the children of Yisra'el in Mitspah.
\p
\v 7 When the Philistines heard that the children of Yisra'el were gathered together at Mitspah, the chiefs of the Philistines went up against Yisra'el. When the children of Yisra'el heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
\v 8 The children of Yisra'el said to Shemu'el, "Do not cease to cry to יהוה our Elohim for us, that He will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."
\v 9 Shemu'el took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole ascension offering to יהוה: and Shemu'el cried to יהוה for Yisra'el; and יהוה answered him.
\v 10 As Shemu'el was offering up the ascension offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Yisra'el; but יהוה thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them; and they were struck down before Yisra'el.
\v 11 The men of Yisra'el went out of Mitspah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.
\p
\v 12 Then Shemu'el took a stone, and set it between Mitspah and Shen, and called its name Even Haezor, saying, "יהוה helped us until now."
\v 13 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Yisra'el. The Hand of יהוה was against the Philistines all the days of Shemu'el.
\v 14 The cities which the Philistines had taken from Yisra'el were restored to Yisra'el, from Eqron even to Gath; and its border did Yisra'el deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Yisra'el and the Amorites.
\p
\v 15 Shemu'el judged Yisra'el all the days of his life.
\v 16 He went from year to year in circuit to Beth-El and Gilgal, and Mitspah; and he judged Yisra'el in all those places.
\v 17 His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Yisra'el: and he built there an altar to יהוה.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 It happened, when Shemu'el was old, that he made his sons judges over Yisra'el.
\v 2 Now the name of his firstborn was Yo'el; and the name of his second, Aviyah: they were judges in Beersheva.
\v 3 His sons did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
\p
\v 4 Then all the elders of Yisra'el gathered themselves together, and came to Shemu'el to Ramah;
\v 5 and they said to him, "Behold, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
\v 6 But the thing displeased Shemu'el, when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." Shemu'el prayed to יהוה.
\v 7 יהוה said to Shemu'el, "Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not be king over them.
\v 8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Mitsrayim even to this day, in that they have forsaken Me, and served other elohim, so do they also to you.
\v 9 Now therefore listen to their voice: however you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the judgment of the king who shall reign over them."
\p
\v 10 Shemu'el told all the words of יהוה to the people who asked of him a king.
\v 11 He said, "This will be the judgment of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them to him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;
\v 12 and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.
\v 13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
\v 14 He will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
\v 15 He will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
\v 16 He will take your male servants, and your female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work.
\v 17 He will take the tenth of your flocks: and you shall be his servants.
\v 18 You shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall have chosen you; and יהוה will not answer you in that day."
\p
\v 19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Shemu'el; and they said, "No; but we will have a king over us,
\v 20 that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
\v 21 Shemu'el heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of יהוה.
\v 22 יהוה  said to Shemu'el, "Listen to their voice, and make them a king." Shemu'el said to the men of Yisra'el, "Every man go to his city."
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Now there was a man of Benyamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Avi'el, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiyaḥ, the son of a Benyamite, a mighty man of valor.
\v 2 He had a son, whose name was Sha'ul, an impressive young man; and there was not among the children of Yisra'el a better person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
\p
\v 3 The donkeys of Kish, Sha'ul's father, were lost. Kish said to Sha'ul his son, "Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys."
\v 4 He passed through the hill country of Ephrayim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them: then they passed through the land of Sha'alim, and there they were not there: and he passed through the land of the Benyamites, but they did not find them.
\p
\v 5 When they had come to the land of Tsuph, Sha'ul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, and let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be anxious for us."
\v 6 He said to him, "See now, there is in this city a man of Elohim, and he is a man who is held in honor. All that he says comes surely to pass. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go."
\v 7 Then Sha'ul said to his servant, "But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of Elohim. What do we have?"
\v 8 The servant answered Sha'ul again, and said, "Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a sheqel of silver. I will give that to the man of Elohim, to tell us our way."
\v 9 (In earlier times in Yisra'el, when a man went to inquire of Elohim, thus he said, "Come, and let us go to the seer;" for he who is now called a prophet was before called a Seer.)
\v 10 Then Sha'ul said to his servant, "Well said. Come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of Elohim was.
\p
\v 11 As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, "Is the seer here?"
\v 12 They answered them, and said, "He is. Behold, he is before you. Hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.
\v 13 As soon as you have come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he blesses the sacrifice. Afterwards those who are invited will eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you shall find him."
\v 14 They went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Shemu'el came out toward them, to go up to the high place.
\p
\v 15 Now יהוה had revealed to Shemu'el a day before Sha'ul came, saying,
\v 16 "Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benyamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over My people Yisra'el; and he shall save My people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on My people, because their cry has come to Me."
\v 17 When Shemu'el saw Sha'ul, יהוה said to him, "Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! This same shall have authority over My people."
\v 18 Then Sha'ul drew near to Shemu'el in the gate, and said, "Please tell me where the seer's house is."
\v 19 Shemu'el answered Sha'ul, and said, "I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.
\v 20 As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, do not set your heart on them; for they are found. For whom is all that is desirable in Yisra'el? Is it not for you, and for all your father's house?"
\v 21 Sha'ul answered, "Am I not a Benyamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Yisra'el? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benyamin? Why then do you speak to me like this?"
\p
\v 22 Shemu'el took Sha'ul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.
\v 23 Shemu'el said to the cook, "Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, 'Set it aside.'"
\v 24 The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Sha'ul. Shemu'el said, "Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because for the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, 'I have invited the people.'" So Sha'ul ate with Shemu'el that day.
\p
\v 25 When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Sha'ul on the housetop.
\v 26 They arose early: and it came about, around the rising of the dawn, that Shemu'el called to Sha'ul on the housetop, saying, "Get up, that I may send you away." Sha'ul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Shemu'el, abroad.
\v 27 As they were going down at the end of the city, Shemu'el said to Sha'ul, "Tell the servant pass on before us" (and he passed on), "but stand still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of Elohim."
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Then Shemu'el took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, "Is it not that יהוה has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?
\v 2 When you have departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Raḥeil's grave, in the border of Benyamin at Tseltsaḥ; and they will tell you, 'The donkeys which you went to seek have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, "What shall I do for my son?"'
\v 3 "Then you shall go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tavor; and three men shall meet you there going up to Elohim to Beth-El, one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
\v 4 and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.
\v 5 "After that you shall come to the hill of Elohim, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you have come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:
\v 6 and the Ruaḥ of יהוה will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.
\v 7 Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for Elohim is with you.
\v 8 You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer ascension offerings, and to slaughter sacrifices of peace offerings: you shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do."
\p
\v 9 It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Shemu'el, Elohim gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day.
\v 10 When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Ruaḥ of Elohim came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.
\v 11 It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, "What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Sha'ul also among the prophets?"
\v 12 One of the same place answered, "Who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb, "Is Sha'ul also among the prophets?"
\v 13 When he finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
\p
\v 14 Sha'ul's uncle said to him and to his servant, "Where did you go?" He said, "To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Shemu'el."
\v 15 Sha'ul's uncle said, "Please tell me what Shemu'el said to you."
\v 16 Sha'ul said to his uncle, "He told us plainly that the donkeys were found." But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Shemu'el spoke, he did not tell him.
\p
\v 17 Shemu'el called the people together to יהוה to Mitspah;
\v 18 and he said to the children of Yisra'el, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'I brought up Yisra'el out of Mitsrayim, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Mitsrites, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:'
\v 19 but you have rejected your Elohim today, who Himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to Him, 'No, but set a king over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before יהוה by your tribes, and by your thousands."
\p
\v 20 So Shemu'el brought all the tribes of Yisra'el near, and the tribe of Benyamin was taken.
\v 21 He brought the tribe of Benyamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Sha'ul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.
\v 22 Therefore they asked of יהוה further, "Is there yet a man to come here?" יהוה answered, "Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage."
\v 23 They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
\v 24 Shemu'el said to all the people, "You see him whom יהוה has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?" All the people shouted, and said, "Let the king live!"
\p
\v 25 Then Shemu'el told the people the judgment of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before יהוה. Shemu'el sent all the people away, every man to his house.
\v 26 Sha'ul also went to his house to Givah; and there went with him the army, whose hearts Elohim had touched.
\v 27 But certain sons of Beliyya'al said, "How shall this man save us?" They despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then Naḥash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Yavesh Gilad: and all the men of Yavesh said to Naḥash, "Cut a covenant with us, and we will serve you."
\v 2 Naḥash the Ammonite said to them, "On this condition I will cut it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach on all Yisra'el."
\v 3 The elders of Yavesh said to him, "Give us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Yisra'el; and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you."
\v 4 Then the messengers came to Givah of Sha'ul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\p
\v 5 Behold, Sha'ul came following the oxen out of the field; and Sha'ul said, "What ails the people that they weep?" They told him the words of the men of Yavesh.
\v 6 The Ruaḥ of Elohim came mightily on Sha'ul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.
\v 7 He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Yisra'el by the hand of messengers, saying, "Whoever does not come forth after Sha'ul and after Shemu'el, so shall it be done to his oxen." The dread of יהוה fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
\v 8 He numbered them in Bezeq; and the children of Yisra'el were three hundred thousand, and the men of Yehudah thirty thousand.
\v 9 They said to the messengers who came, "Thus you shall tell the men of Yavesh Gilad, 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.'" The messengers came and told the men of Yavesh; and they were glad.
\v 10 Therefore the men of Yavesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good in your eyes."
\v 11 It was so on the next day, that Sha'ul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came about, that those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
\p
\v 12 The people said to Shemu'el, "Who is he who said, 'Shall Sha'ul reign over us?' Bring those men, that we may put them to death!"
\v 13 Sha'ul said, "There will not be a man be put to death today; for today יהוה has worked deliverance in Yisra'el."
\p
\v 14 Then Shemu'el said to the people, "Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
\v 15 All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Sha'ul king before יהוה in Gilgal; and there they slaughtered sacrifices of peace offerings before יהוה; and there Sha'ul and all the men of Yisra'el rejoiced greatly.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Shemu'el said to all Yisra'el, "Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.
\v 2 Now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth to today.
\v 3 Here I am. Witness against me before יהוה, and before His anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes therewith? I will restore it to you."
\v 4 They said, "You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any man's hand."
\v 5 He said to them, "יהוה is witness against you, and His anointed is witness today, that you have not found anything in my hand." They said, "He is witness."
\p
\v 6 Shemu'el said to the people, "It is יהוה who appointed Mosheh and Aharon, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 7 Now therefore stand still, that I may judge with you before יהוה concerning all the righteous acts of יהוה, which He did to you and to your fathers.
\v 8 "When Ya'aqov was come into Mitsrayim, and your fathers cried to יהוה, then יהוה sent Mosheh and Aharon, who brought forth your fathers out of Mitsrayim, and made them to dwell in this place.
\v 9 "But they forgot יהוה their Elohim; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Ḥatsor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moav; and they fought against them.
\v 10 They cried to יהוה, and said, 'We have sinned, because we have forsaken יהוה, and have served the Ba'als and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.'
\v 11 יהוה sent Yerubba'al, and Bedan, and Yiphthaḥ, and Shemu'el, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived securely.
\p
\v 12 "When you saw that Naḥash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us;' when יהוה your Elohim was your king.
\v 13 Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and behold, יהוה has set a king over you.
\v 14 If you will fear יהוה, and serve Him, and listen to His voice, and not rebel against the command of יהוה, and both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of יהוה your Elohim, well:
\v 15 but if you will not listen to the voice of יהוה, but rebel against the command of יהוה, then will the hand of יהוה be against you, as it was against your fathers.
\v 16 "Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which יהוה will do before your eyes.
\v 17 Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call to יהוה, that he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that your evil is great, which you have done in the sight of יהוה, in asking for a king."
\v 18 So Shemu'el called to יהוה; and יהוה sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared יהוה and Shemu'el.
\p
\v 19 All the people said to Shemu'el, "Pray for your servants to יהוה your Elohim, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king."
\v 20 Shemu'el said to the people, "Do not be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil; yet do not turn aside from following יהוה, but serve יהוה with all your heart.
\v 21 Do not turn aside; for then you would go after worthless things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are worthless.
\v 22 For יהוה will not forsake His people for His great Name's sake, because it has pleased יהוה to make you a people to Himself.
\v 23 Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against יהוה in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
\v 24 Only fear יהוה, and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things He has done for you.
\v 25 But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king."
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Sha'ul was a son of a year when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Yisra'el,
\p
\v 2 Sha'ul chose him three thousand men of Yisra'el, of which two thousand were with Sha'ul in Mikmash and in the Mount of Beth-El, and one thousand were with Yonathan in Givah of Benyamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
\v 3 Yonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geva: and the Philistines heard of it. Sha'ul blew the shofar throughout all the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear!"
\v 4 All Yisra'el heard that Sha'ul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Yisra'el had become odious to the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Sha'ul to Gilgal.
\p
\v 5 The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Yisra'el, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Mikmash, eastward of Beth Aven.
\v 6 When the men of Yisra'el saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.
\v 7 Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Yarden to the land of Gad and Gilad; but as for Sha'ul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
\p
\v 8 He stayed seven days, according to the set time that Shemu'el set: but Shemu'el did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
\v 9 Sha'ul said, "Bring here the ascension offering to me, and the peace offerings." He offered the ascension offering.
\p
\v 10 It came about that as soon as he had finished offering the ascension offering, behold, Shemu'el came; and Sha'ul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.
\v 11 Shemu'el said, "What have you done?" Sha'ul said, "Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Mikmash;
\v 12 therefore I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of יהוה.' I forced myself therefore, and offered the ascension offering."
\v 13 Shemu'el said to Sha'ul, "You have done foolishly. You have not guarded the command of יהוה your Elohim, which He commanded you; for now יהוה would have established your kingdom on Yisra'el forever.
\v 14 But now your kingdom shall not continue. יהוה has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and יהוה has appointed Him to be prince over his people, because you have not guarded that which יהוה commanded you."
\p
\v 15 Shemu'el arose, and went from Gilgal to Givah of Benyamin. Sha'ul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
\p
\v 16 Sha'ul, and Yonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geva of Benyamin: but the Philistines encamped in Mikmash.
\v 17 The spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
\v 18 and another company turned the way to Beth Ḥoron; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Tsevoyim toward the wilderness.
\p
\v 19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Yisra'el; for the Philistines said, "Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears;"
\v 20 but all the Yisra'elites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle;
\v 21 yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
\v 22 So it came about in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Sha'ul and Yonathan: but with Sha'ul and with Yonathan his son was there found.
\v 23 The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Mikmash.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Now it fell on a day, that Yonathan the son of Sha'ul said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison that is on the other side." But he did not tell his father.
\v 2 Sha'ul stayed in the uttermost part of Givah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;
\v 3 and Aḥiyah, the son of Aḥituv, I-Kavod's brother, the son of Pineḥas, the son of Eli, the priest of יהוה in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people did not know that Yonathan was gone.
\v 4 Between the passes, by which Yonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Botsets, and the name of the other Seneh.
\v 5 The one crag rose up on the north in front of Mikmash, and the other on the south in front of Geva.
\p
\v 6 Yehonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that יהוה will work for us; for there is no restraint on יהוה to save by many or by few."
\v 7 His armor bearer said to him, "Do all that is in your heart. Turn and, behold, I am with you according to your heart."
\v 8 Then Yehonathan said, "Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them.
\v 9 If they say thus to us, 'Wait until we come to you!' then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
\v 10 But if they say this, 'Come up to us!' then we will go up; for יהוה has delivered them into our hand. This shall be the sign to us."
\v 11 Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, "Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!"
\v 12 The men of the garrison answered Yonathan and his armor bearer, and said, "Come up to us, and we will show you something!" Yonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come up after me; for יהוה has delivered them into the hand of Yisra'el."
\v 13 Yonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Yonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.
\v 14 That first slaughter, which Yonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.
\p
\v 15 There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.
\p
\v 16 The watchmen of Sha'ul in Givah of Benyamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went here and there.
\v 17 Then Sha'ul said to the people who were with him, "Count now, and see who is missing from us." When they had counted, behold, Yonathan and his armor bearer were not there.
\v 18 Sha'ul said to Aḥiyah, "Bring the ark of Elohim here." For the ark of Elohim was there at that time with the children of Yisra'el.
\v 19 It happened, while Sha'ul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Sha'ul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand!"
\v 20 Sha'ul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great confusion.
\v 21 Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, from the country all around, even they also turned to be with the Yisra'elites who were with Sha'ul and Yonathan.
\v 22 Likewise all the men of Yisra'el who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephrayim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
\v 23 So יהוה saved Yisra'el that day: and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.
\p
\v 24 The men of Yisra'el were distressed that day; for Sha'ul had adjured the people, saying, "Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies." So none of the people tasted food.
\v 25 All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.
\v 26 When the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.
\v 27 But Yonathan did not hear when his father commanded the people with the oath: therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
\v 28 Then one of the people answered, and said, "Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed is the man who eats food today.'" The people were faint.
\v 29 Then Yonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
\v 30 How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? For now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines."
\p
\v 31 They struck of the Philistines that day from Mikmash to Aiyalon. The people were very faint;
\v 32 and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.
\v 33 Then they told Sha'ul, saying, "Behold, the people are sinning against יהוה, in that they eat meat with the blood." He said, "You have dealt deceitfully. Roll a large stone to me today!"
\v 34 Sha'ul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, 'Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and do not sin against יהוה in eating meat with the blood.'" All the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.
\v 35 Sha'ul built an altar to יהוה. This was the first altar that he built to יהוה.
\p
\v 36 Sha'ul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them." They said, "Do whatever seems good in your eyes." Then the priest said, "Let us draw near here to Elohim."
\p
\v 37 Sha'ul asked counsel of Elohim, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Yisra'el?" But he did not answer him that day.
\v 38 Sha'ul said, "Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been today.
\v 39 For, as יהוה lives, who saves Yisra'el, though it is in Yonathan my son, he shall surely die." But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.
\v 40 Then he said to all Yisra'el, "You be on one side, and I and Yonathan my son will be on the other side." The people said to Sha'ul, "Do what seems good in your eyes."
\v 41 Therefore Sha'ul said to יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, "Show the right." Yonathan and Sha'ul were chosen; but the people escaped.
\v 42 Sha'ul said, "Cast lots between me and Yonathan my son." Yonathan was selected.
\p
\v 43 Then Sha'ul said to Yonathan, "Tell me what you have done!" Yonathan told him, and said, "I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die."
\v 44 Sha'ul said, "Elohim do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Yonathan."
\v 45 The people said to Sha'ul, "Shall Yonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Yisra'el? Far from it! As יהוה lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with Elohim today!" So the people rescued Yonathan, that he did not die.
\v 46 Then Sha'ul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
\p
\v 47 Now when Sha'ul had taken the kingdom over Yisra'el, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moav, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Tsovah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he put them to the worse.
\v 48 He did valiantly, and struck the Amaleqites, and delivered Yisra'el out of the hands of those who despoiled them.
\p
\v 49 Now the sons of Sha'ul were Yonathan, and Yishvi, and Malkishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merav, and the name of the younger Mikhal:
\v 50 and the name of Sha'ul's wife was Aḥinoam the daughter of Aḥima'ats. The name of the captain of his army was Avner the son of Ner, Sha'ul's uncle.
\v 51 Kish was the father of Sha'ul; and Ner the father of Avner was the son of Avi'el.
\p
\v 52 There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Sha'ul: and when Sha'ul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Shemu'el said to Sha'ul, "יהוה sent me to anoint you to be king over His people, over Yisra'el. Now therefore listen to the voice of the words of יהוה.
\v 2 Thus says יהוה Tsevaot, 'I have marked that which Amaleq did to Yisra'el, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Mitsrayim.
\v 3 Now go and strike Amaleq, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'"
\p
\v 4 Sha'ul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Yehudah.
\v 5 Sha'ul came to the city of Amaleq, and laid wait in the wadi.
\v 6 Sha'ul said to the Qenites, "Go, depart, go down from among the Amaleqites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed loving-kindness to all the children of Yisra'el, when they came up out of Mitsrayim." So the Qenites departed from among the Amaleqites.
\v 7 Sha'ul struck the Amaleqites, from Ḥavilah as you go to Shur, that is before Mitsrayim.
\v 8 He took Agag the king of the Amaleqites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
\v 9 But Sha'ul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
\p
\v 10 Then the word of יהוה came to Shemu'el, saying,
\v 11 "It grieves Me that I have set up Sha'ul to be king; for he is turned back from following Me, and has not performed My commands." Shemu'el was angry; and he cried to יהוה all night.
\v 12 Shemu'el rose early to meet Sha'ul in the morning; and it was told Shemu'el, saying, "Sha'ul came to Karmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal."
\v 13 Shemu'el came to Sha'ul; and Sha'ul said to him, "You are blessed by יהוה! I have performed the command of יהוה."
\v 14 Shemu'el said, "Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?"
\v 15 Sha'ul said, "They have brought them from the Amaleqites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to slaughter to יהוה your Elohim. We have utterly destroyed the rest."
\v 16 Then Shemu'el said to Sha'ul, "Stay, and I will tell you what יהוה has said to me last night." He said to him, "Speak."
\p
\v 17 Shemu'el said, "Though you were little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Yisra'el? יהוה anointed you king over Yisra'el;
\v 18 and יהוה sent you on a journey, and said, 'Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amaleqites, and fight against them until they are consumed.'
\v 19 Why then did you not obey the voice of יהוה, but took the spoils, and did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה?"
\p
\v 20 Sha'ul said to Shemu'el, "But I have obeyed the voice of יהוה, and have gone the way which יהוה sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amaleq, and have utterly destroyed the Amaleqites.
\v 21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to slaughter to יהוה your Elohim in Gilgal."
\p
\v 22 Shemu'el said, "Does יהוה have as great a delight in ascension offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of יהוה? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.
\p
\v 23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as vain exertion and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of יהוה, He has also rejected you from being king."
\p
\v 24 Sha'ul said to Shemu'el, "I have sinned; for I have transgressed the command of יהוה, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
\v 25 Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may bow down to יהוה."
\v 26 Shemu'el said to Sha'ul, "I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of יהוה, and יהוה has rejected you from being king over Yisra'el."
\v 27 As Shemu'el turned about to go away, Sha'ul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.
\v 28 Shemu'el said to him, "יהוה has torn the kingdom of Yisra'el from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.
\v 29 Also the Strength of Yisra'el will not lie nor relent; for He is not a man, that He should relent."
\v 30 Then he said, "I have sinned: yet please honor me now before the elders of my people, and before Yisra'el, and come back with me, that I may bow down to יהוה your Elohim."
\v 31 So Shemu'el went back with Sha'ul; and Sha'ul bowed down to יהוה.
\p
\v 32 Then Shemu'el said, "Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amaleqites!" Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."
\v 33 Shemu'el said, "As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women!" Shemu'el cut Agag in pieces before יהוה in Gilgal.
\p
\v 34 Then Shemu'el went to Ramah; and Sha'ul went up to his house to Givah of Sha'ul.
\v 35 Shemu'el came no more to see Sha'ul until the day of his death; for Shemu'el mourned for Sha'ul: and יהוה grieved that He had made Sha'ul king over Yisra'el.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 יהוה said to Shemu'el, "How long will you mourn for Sha'ul, since I have rejected him from being king over Yisra'el? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Yishai the Beth-leḥemite; for I have provided a king for Myself among his sons."
\v 2 Shemu'el said, "How can I go? If Sha'ul hears it, he will kill me." יהוה said, "Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to slaughter to יהוה.
\v 3 Call Yishai to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to Me him whom I name to you."
\v 4 Shemu'el did that which יהוה spoke, and came to Beth-leḥem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, "Do you come peaceably?"
\v 5 He said, "Peaceably; I have come to slaughter to יהוה. Set yourselves apart, and come with me to the sacrifice." He set apart Yishai and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
\p
\v 6 It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliav, and said, "Surely the anointed of יהוה is before him."
\v 7 But יהוה said to Shemu'el, "Do not look on his face, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for יהוה sees not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but יהוה looks at the heart."
\v 8 Then Yishai called Avinadav, and made him pass before Shemu'el. He said, "Neither has יהוה chosen this one."
\v 9 Then Yishai made Shammah to pass by. He said, "Neither has יהוה chosen this one."
\v 10 Yishai made seven of his sons to pass before Shemu'el. Shemu'el said to Yishai, "יהוה has not chosen these."
\v 11 Shemu'el said to Yishai, "Are all your children here?" He said, "There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is keeping the sheep." Shemu'el said to Yishai, "Send and get him; for we will not sit down until he comes here."
\p
\v 12 He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was goodly to look on. יהוה said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he."
\v 13 Then Shemu'el took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Ruaḥ of יהוה came mightily on David from that day forward. So Shemu'el rose up, and went to Ramah.
\p
\v 14 Now the Ruaḥ of יהוה departed from Sha'ul, and an evil spirit from יהוה troubled him.
\v 15 Sha'ul's servants said to him, "See now, an evil spirit from Elohim troubles you.
\v 16 Let our master now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. It shall happen, when the evil spirit from Elohim is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well."
\v 17 Sha'ul said to his servants, "Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me."
\v 18 Then one of the young men answered, and said, "Behold, I have seen a son of Yishai the Beth-leḥemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a comely person; and יהוה is with him."
\v 19 Therefore Sha'ul sent messengers to Yishai, and said, "Send me David your son, who is with the sheep."
\v 20 Yishai took a donkey loaded with bread, and a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Sha'ul.
\v 21 David came to Sha'ul, and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.
\v 22 Sha'ul sent to Yishai, saying, "Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight."
\v 23 It happened, when the evil spirit from Elohim was on Sha'ul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Sha'ul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Sokoh, which belongs to Yehudah, and encamped between Sokoh and Azeqah, in Ephesdammim.
\v 2 Sha'ul and the men of Yisra'el were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
\v 3 The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Yisra'el stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
\v 4 There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
\v 5 He had a helmet of copper on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand sheqels of copper.
\v 6 He had copper shin armor on his legs, and a javelin of copper between his shoulders.
\v 7 The staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred sheqels of iron: and his shield bearer went before him.
\v 8 He stood and cried to the armies of Yisra'el, and said to them, "Why have you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Sha'ul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.
\v 9 If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then you will be our servants, and serve us."
\v 10 The Philistine said, "I defy the armies of Yisra'el today! Give me a man, that we may fight together!"
\v 11 When Sha'ul and all Yisra'el heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
\p
\v 12 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-leḥem Yehudah, whose name was Yishai; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Sha'ul, stricken in years among men.
\v 13 The three eldest sons of Yishai had gone after Sha'ul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliav the firstborn, and next to him Avinadav, and the third Shammah.
\v 14 David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Sha'ul.
\v 15 Now David went back and forth from Sha'ul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-leḥem.
\v 16 The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
\p
\v 17 Yishai said to David his son, "Now take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;
\v 18 and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers are doing, and bring back news."
\v 19 Now Sha'ul, and they, and all the men of Yisra'el, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
\p
\v 20 David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Yishai had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.
\v 21 Yisra'el and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.
\v 22 David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.
\v 23 As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.
\p
\v 24 All the men of Yisra'el, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were terrified.
\v 25 The men of Yisra'el said, "Have you seen this man who is come up? He has surely come up to defy Yisra'el. It shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Yisra'el."
\p
\v 26 David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, "What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Yisra'el? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living Elohim?"
\v 27 The people answered him in this way, saying, "So shall it be done to the man who kills him."
\p
\v 28 Eliav his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliav's anger was kindled against David, and he said, "Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle."
\v 29 David said, "What have I now done? Is there not a cause?"
\v 30 He turned away from him toward another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way.
\p
\v 31 When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Sha'ul; and he sent for him.
\v 32 David said to Sha'ul, "Let no man's heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
\v 33 Sha'ul said to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."
\v 34 David said to Sha'ul, "Your servant was keeping his father's sheep; and when a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb out of the flock,
\v 35 I went out after him, and struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.
\v 36 Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living Elohim."
\v 37 David said, "יהוה who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine." Sha'ul said to David, "Go; and יהוה shall be with you."
\v 38 Sha'ul dressed David with his clothing. He put a helmet of copper on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.
\v 39 David strapped his sword on his clothing, and he tried to move; for he had not tested it. David said to Sha'ul, "I cannot go with these; for I have not tested them." David took them off.
\v 40 He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the wadi, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his money pouch. His sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine.
\p
\v 41 The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.
\v 42 When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and was beautiful in appearance.
\v 43 The Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?" The Philistine cursed David by his elohim.
\v 44 The Philistine said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens, and to the animals of the field."
\v 45 Then David said to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to you in the Name of יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of the armies of Yisra'el, whom you have defied.
\v 46 Today, יהוה will deliver you into my hand. I will strike you, and take your head from off you. I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines today to the birds of the heavens, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is an Elohim in Yisra'el,
\v 47 and that all this assembly may know that יהוה does not save with sword and spear: for the battle belongs to יהוה, and He will give you into our hand."
\p
\v 48 It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
\v 49 David put his hand in his bag, took a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.
\p
\v 50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
\v 51 Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him, and cut off his head therewith. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
\v 52 The men of Yisra'el and of Yehudah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Eqron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Sha'araim, even to Gath, and to Eqron.
\v 53 The children of Yisra'el returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
\v 54 David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Yerushalayim; but he put his armor in his tent.
\p
\v 55 When Sha'ul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Avner, the captain of the army, "Avner, whose son is this youth?" Avner said, "As your being lives, O king, I cannot tell."
\v 56 The king said, "Inquire whose son the young man is!"
\v 57 As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Avner took him, and brought him before Sha'ul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
\v 58 Sha'ul said to him, "Whose son are you, you young man?" David answered, "I am the son of your servant Yishai the Beth-leḥemite."
\c 18
\p
\v 1 It happened, when he finished speaking to Sha'ul, that the being of Yehonathan was knit with the being of David, and Yehonathan loved him as his own being.
\v 2 Sha'ul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
\v 3 Then Yehonathan and David cut a covenant, because he loved him as his own being.
\v 4 Yehonathan stripped himself of the outer robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his clothing, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his sash.
\p
\v 5 David went out wherever Sha'ul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Sha'ul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Sha'ul's servants.
\v 6 It happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Yisra'el, singing and dancing, to meet King Sha'ul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.
\p
\v 7 The women sang one to another as they played, and said, "Sha'ul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands."
\p
\v 8 Sha'ul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; and he said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands. What can he have more but the kingdom?"
\v 9 Sha'ul eyed David from that day and forward.
\v 10 It happened on the next day, that an evil spirit from Elohim came mightily on Sha'ul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house. David played with his hand, as he did day by day. Sha'ul had his spear in his hand;
\v 11 and Sha'ul threw the spear; for he said, "I will pin David even to the wall!" David escaped from his presence twice.
\p
\v 12 Sha'ul was afraid of David, because יהוה was with him, and was departed from Sha'ul.
\v 13 Therefore Sha'ul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
\v 14 David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and יהוה was with him.
\v 15 When Sha'ul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.
\v 16 But all Yisra'el and Yehudah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.
\p
\v 17 Sha'ul said to David, "Behold, my elder daughter Merav, I will give her to you as wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight the battles of יהוה." For Sha'ul said, "Do not let my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him."
\v 18 David said to Sha'ul, "Who am I, and what is my life, or my father's family in Yisra'el, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
\v 19 But it happened at the time when Merav, Sha'ul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adri'el the Meḥolathite as wife.
\p
\v 20 Mikhal, Sha'ul's daughter, loved David; and they told Sha'ul, and the thing pleased him.
\v 21 Sha'ul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Sha'ul said to David, "You shall be my son-in-law a second time today."
\v 22 Sha'ul commanded his servants, "Talk with David secretly, and say, 'Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king's son-in-law.'"
\v 23 Sha'ul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, "Does it seems to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
\v 24 The servants of Sha'ul told him, saying, "David spoke like this."
\v 25 Sha'ul said, "You shall tell David, 'The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies.'" Now Sha'ul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
\v 26 When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. The days were not expired;
\v 27 and David arose and went, he and his men, and killed of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. Sha'ul gave him Mikhal his daughter as wife.
\v 28 Sha'ul saw and knew that יהוה was with David; and Mikhal, Sha'ul's daughter, loved him.
\v 29 Sha'ul was yet the more afraid of David; and Sha'ul was David's enemy continually.
\v 30 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came about, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Sha'ul; so that his name was highly esteemed.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Sha'ul spoke to Yonathan his son, and to all his servants, and told them that they should kill David. But Yonathan, Sha'ul's son, delighted much in David.
\v 2 Yehonathan told David, saying, "Sha'ul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself.
\v 3 I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you."
\v 4 Yehonathan spoke good of David to Sha'ul his father, and said to him, "Do not let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you;
\v 5 for he put his being in his palm, and struck the Philistine, and יהוה worked a great victory for all Yisra'el. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?"
\v 6 Sha'ul listened to the voice of Yehonathan: and Sha'ul swore, "As יהוה lives, he shall not be put to death."
\v 7 Yehonathan called David, and Yehonathan showed him all those things. Yehonathan brought David to Sha'ul, and he was in his presence, as before.
\p
\v 8 There was war again. David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.
\v 9 An evil spirit from יהוה was on Sha'ul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.
\v 10 Sha'ul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Sha'ul's presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night.
\p
\v 11 Sha'ul sent messengers to David's house, to guard him, and to kill him in the morning. Mikhal, David's wife, told him, saying, "If you do not save your being tonight, tomorrow you will be killed."
\v 12 So Mikhal let David down through the window. He went, fled, and escaped.
\v 13 Mikhal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair at its head, and covered it with the clothes.
\v 14 When Sha'ul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is sick."
\v 15 Sha'ul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him."
\v 16 When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at its head.
\v 17 Sha'ul said to Mikhal, "Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is escaped?" Mikhal answered Sha'ul, "He said to me, 'Let me go! Why should I kill you?'"
\p
\v 18 Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Shemu'el to Ramah, and told him all that Sha'ul had done to him. He and Shemu'el went and lived in Naioth.
\v 19 It was told Sha'ul, saying, "Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."
\v 20 Sha'ul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Shemu'el standing as head over them, the Ruaḥ of Elohim came on the messengers of Sha'ul, and they also prophesied.
\v 21 When it was told Sha'ul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Sha'ul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
\v 22 Then he went also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Seku: and he asked, "Where are Shemu'el and David?" One said, "Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."
\v 23 He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then the Ruaḥ of Elohim came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
\v 24 He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Shemu'el, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, "Is Sha'ul also among the prophets?"
\c 20
\p
\v 1 David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Yehonathan, "What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my being?"
\v 2 He said to him, "Far from it; you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so."
\v 3 David swore moreover, and said, "Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says, 'Do not let Yehonathan know this, lest he be grieved:' but truly as יהוה lives, and as your being lives, there is but a step between me and death."
\v 4 Then Yehonathan said to David, "Whatever your being desires, I will even do it for you."
\v 5 David said to Yehonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.
\v 6 If your father miss me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-leḥem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'
\v 7 If he says, 'It is well;' your servant shall have peace: but if he be angry, then know that evil is determined by him.
\v 8 Therefore deal with your servant in loving-kindness; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of יהוה with you: but if there be in me iniquity, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?"
\p
\v 9 Yehonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then would I not tell you that?"
\p
\v 10 Then David said to Yehonathan, "Who shall tell me if perchance your father answers you harshly?"
\p
\v 11 Yehonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out into the field." They both went out into the field.
\p
\v 12 Yehonathan said to David, "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, be witness: when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?
\v 13 יהוה do so to Yehonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I do not disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and יהוה be with you, as He has been with my father.
\v 14 You shall show me the loving-kindness of יהוה not only while I still live, that I not die;
\v 15 but also you shall not cut off your loving-kindness from my house forever; no, not when יהוה has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth."
\p
\v 16 So Yehonathan cut a covenant with the house of David, saying, "יהוה will require it at the hand of David's enemies."
\v 17 Yehonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own being.
\p
\v 18 Then Yehonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
\v 19 When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.
\v 20 I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.
\v 21 Behold, I will send the boy, saying, 'Go, find the arrows!' If I tell the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are on this side of you. Take them;' then come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as יהוה lives.
\v 22 But if I say this to the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you;' then go your way; for יהוה has sent you away.
\v 23 Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, יהוה is between you and me forever."
\p
\v 24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.
\v 25 The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Yehonathan stood up, and Avner sat by Sha'ul's side: but David's place was empty.
\v 26 Nevertheless Sha'ul said nothing that day: for he thought, "Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean."
\p
\v 27 It happened on the next day after the new moon, the second day, that David's place was empty. Sha'ul said to Yehonathan his son, "Why does the son of Yishai not come to eat, neither yesterday, nor today?"
\v 28 Yehonathan answered Sha'ul, "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-leḥem.
\v 29 He said, 'Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.' Therefore he has not come to the king's table."
\p
\v 30 Then Sha'ul's anger was kindled against Yehonathan, and he said to him, "You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Yishai to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
\v 31 For all the days that the son of Yishai lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!"
\p
\v 32 Yehonathan answered Sha'ul his father, and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
\v 33 Sha'ul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Yehonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.
\v 34 So Yehonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the new moon; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
\p
\v 35 It happened in the morning, that Yehonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.
\v 36 He said to his boy, "Run, find now the arrows which I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
\v 37 When the boy was come to the place of the arrow which Yehonathan had shot, Yehonathan cried after the boy, and said, "Is not the arrow beyond you?"
\v 38 Yehonathan cried after the boy, "Go fast! Hurry! Do not delay!" Yehonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
\v 39 But the boy did not know anything. Only Yehonathan and David knew the matter.
\v 40 Yehonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, "Go, carry them to the city."
\v 41 As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another, and wept one with another, and David wept the most.
\v 42 Yehonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have both sworn in the name of יהוה, saying, 'יהוה shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever.'" He arose and departed; and Yehonathan went into the city.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Then came David to Nov to Aḥimelekh the priest. Aḥimelekh came to meet David trembling, and said to him, "Why are you alone, and no man with you?"
\v 2 David said to Aḥimelekh the priest, "The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, 'Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you; and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.'
\v 3 Now therefore what is under your hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present."
\p
\v 4 The priest answered David, and said, "There is no common bread under my hand, but there is set-apart bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women."
\v 5 David answered the priest, and said to him, "Truly, women have been kept from us about these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were set-apart, though it was but a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be set-apart?"
\v 6 So the priest gave him set-apart bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before יהוה, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
\v 7 Now a certain man of the servants of Sha'ul was there that day, detained before יהוה; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Sha'ul.
\p
\v 8 David said to Aḥimelekh, "Is there not here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."
\v 9 The priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here." David said, "There is none like that. Give it to me."
\p
\v 10 David arose, and fled that day for fear of Sha'ul, and went to Akish the king of Gath.
\v 11 The servants of Akish said to him, "Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another about him in dances, saying, 'Sha'ul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands'?"
\p
\v 12 David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Akish the king of Gath.
\v 13 He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.
\v 14 Then Akish said to his servants, "Look, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?
\v 15 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?"
\c 22
\p
\v 1 David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.
\v 2 Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who had a creditor, and everyone who was bitter of being, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
\p
\v 3 David went there to Mitspeh of Moav, and he said to the king of Moav, "Please let my father and my mother come out with you, until I know what Elohim will do for me."
\v 4 He brought them before the king of Moav; and they lived with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
\v 5 The prophet Gad said to David, "Do not stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into the land of Yehudah." Then David departed, and came into the forest of Ḥereth.
\p
\v 6 Sha'ul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Now Sha'ul was sitting in Givah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.
\v 7 Sha'ul said to his servants who stood about him, "Hear now, you Benyamites! Will the son of Yishai give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
\v 8 that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none who discloses to me when my son cuts a covenant with the son of Yishai, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
\v 9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Sha'ul, answered and said, "I saw the son of Yishai coming to Nov, to Aḥimelekh the son of Aḥituv.
\v 10 He inquired of יהוה for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
\p
\v 11 Then the king sent to call Aḥimelekh the priest, the son of Aḥituv, and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nov: and they came all of them to the king.
\v 12 Sha'ul said, "Hear now, you son of Aḥituv." He answered, "Here I am, my master."
\v 13 Sha'ul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Yishai, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of Elohim for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
\p
\v 14 Then Aḥimelekh answered the king, and said, "Who among all your servants is as faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?
\v 15 Have I today begun to inquire of Elohim for him? Be it far from me! Do not let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more."
\p
\v 16 The king said, "You shall surely die, Aḥimelekh, you, and all your father's house."
\v 17 The king said to the guard who stood about him, "Turn, and kill the priests of יהוה; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me." But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall on the priests of יהוה.
\v 18 The king said to Doeg, "Turn and attack the priests!" Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five people who wore a linen ephod.
\v 19 He struck Nov, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies, and cattle and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
\v 20 One of the sons of Aḥimelekh, the son of Aḥituv, named Evyathar, escaped, and fled after David.
\v 21 Evyathar told David that Sha'ul had slain the priests of יהוה.
\v 22 David said to Evyathar, "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Sha'ul. I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father's house.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Stay with me, do not be afraid; for he who seeks my being seeks your being. For with me you shall be in safeguard."
\p
\v 23 David was told, "Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Qeilah, and are robbing the threshing floors."
\v 2 Therefore David inquired of יהוה, saying, "Shall I go and strike these Philistines?" יהוה said to David, "Go strike the Philistines, and save Qeilah."
\v 3 David's men said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Yehudah: how much more then if we go to Qeilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
\v 4 Then David inquired of יהוה yet again. יהוה answered him, and said, "Arise, go down to Qeilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand."
\v 5 David and his men went to Qeilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Qeilah.
\p
\v 6 It happened, when Evyathar the son of Aḥimelekh fled to David to Qeilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
\p
\v 7 It was told Sha'ul that David had come to Qeilah. Sha'ul said, "Elohim has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars."
\v 8 Sha'ul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Qeilah, to besiege David and his men.
\v 9 David knew that Sha'ul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Evyathar the priest, "Bring the ephod here."
\v 10 Then David said, "O יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, your servant has surely heard that Sha'ul seeks to come to Qeilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
\v 11 Will the men of Qeilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Sha'ul come down, as your servant has heard? יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, I beg you, tell your servant." יהוה said, "He will come down."
\v 12 Then David said, "Will the men of Qeilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Sha'ul?" יהוה said, "They will deliver you up."
\v 13 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Qeilah, and went wherever they could go. It was told Sha'ul that David was escaped from Qeilah; and he gave up going there.
\v 14 David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Sha'ul sought him every day, but Elohim did not deliver him into his hand.
\p
\v 15 David saw that Sha'ul had come out to seek his being. David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.
\v 16 Yehonathan, Sha'ul's son, arose, and went to David into the woods, and strengthened his hand in Elohim.
\v 17 He said to him, "Do not be afraid; for the hand of Sha'ul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Yisra'el, and I shall be next to you; and that also Sha'ul my father knows."
\v 18 They both cut a covenant before יהוה: and David stayed in the woods, and Yehonathan went to his house.
\p
\v 19 Then the Ziphites came up to Sha'ul to Givah, saying, "Does not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Ḥakilah, which is on the south of the desert?
\v 20 Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of your being to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king's hand."
\v 21 Sha'ul said, "You are blessed by יהוה; for you have had compassion on me.
\v 22 Please go make yet surer, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for it is told me that he deals very subtly.
\v 23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come again to me with certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall happen, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Yehudah."
\p
\v 24 They arose, and went to Ziph before Sha'ul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Aravah on the south of the desert.
\v 25 Sha'ul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Sha'ul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
\v 26 Sha'ul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Sha'ul; for Sha'ul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.
\v 27 But a messenger came to Sha'ul, saying, "Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!"
\v 28 So Sha'ul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Hammaḥleqoth.
\v 29 David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 It happened, when Sha'ul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, "Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi."
\v 2 Then Sha'ul took three thousand chosen men out of all Yisra'el, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.
\v 3 He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Sha'ul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.
\v 4 The men of David said to him, "Behold, the day of which יהוה said to you, 'Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.'" Then David arose, and cut off the corner of Sha'ul's robe secretly.
\v 5 It happened afterward, that David's heart struck him, because he had cut off Sha'ul's robe corner.
\v 6 He said to his men, "יהוה forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the anointed of יהוה, to put forth my hand against him, since he is the anointed of יהוה.
\v 7 So David checked his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Sha'ul. Sha'ul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
\p
\v 8 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Sha'ul, saying, "My master the king!" When Sha'ul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and bowed down.
\v 9 David said to Sha'ul, "Why do you listen to men's words, saying, 'Behold, David seeks your hurt?'
\v 10 Behold, today your eyes have seen how that יהוה had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my master; for he is the anointed of יהוה.
\v 11 Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the corner of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the corner of your robe, and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my being to take it.
\v 12 May יהוה judge between me and you, and may יהוה avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.
\v 13 As the proverb of the ancients says, 'Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness;' but my hand shall not be on you.
\v 14 Against whom has the king of Yisra'el come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?
\v 15 May יהוה therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and judge that I should be delivered out of your hand."
\p
\v 16 It came about, when David finished speaking these words to Sha'ul, that Sha'ul said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" Sha'ul lifted up his voice, and wept.
\v 17 He said to David, "You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.
\v 18 You have declared today how you have dealt well with me, because when יהוה had delivered me up into your hand, you did not kill me.
\v 19 For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may יהוה reward you good for that which you have done to me today.
\v 20 Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Yisra'el shall be established in your hand.
\v 21 Swear now therefore to me by יהוה, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house."
\v 22 David swore to Sha'ul. Sha'ul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Shemu'el died; and all Yisra'el gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
\p
\v 2 There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Karmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Karmel.
\v 3 Now the name of the man was Naval; and the name of his wife Avigayil; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful form: but the man was harsh and evil in his doings; and he was of Kalev.
\v 4 David heard in the wilderness that Naval was shearing his sheep.
\v 5 David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, "Go up to Karmel, and go to Naval, and greet him in my name.
\v 6 You shall tell him, 'Long life to you! Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.
\v 7 Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there anything missing to them, all the while they were in Karmel.
\v 8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore, let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.'"
\p
\v 9 When David's young men came, they spoke to Naval according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
\v 10 Naval answered David's servants, and said, "Who is David? Who is the son of Yishai? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days.
\v 11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I do not know where they come from?"
\v 12 So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.
\v 13 David said to his men, "Every man put on his sword!" Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David; and two hundred stayed by the baggage.
\p
\v 14 But one of the young men told Avigayil, Naval's wife, saying, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master; and he railed at them.
\v 15 But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.
\v 16 They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
\v 17 Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a son of Beliyya'al that one cannot speak to him."
\p
\v 18 Then Avigayil hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two bottles of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five measures of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
\v 19 She said to her young men, "Go on before me. Behold, I come after you." But she did not tell her husband, Naval.
\v 20 It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the secret-place of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.
\v 21 Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good.
\v 22 Elohim do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall."
\p
\v 23 When Avigayil saw David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
\v 24 She fell at his feet, and said, "On me, my master, on me be the iniquity; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears. Hear the words of your handmaid.
\v 25 Please do not let my master take to heart this worthless man, even Naval; for as his name is, so is he. Naval is his name, and senselessness is with him; but I, your handmaid, did not see the young men of my master, whom you sent.
\p
\v 26 "Now therefore, my master, as יהוה lives, and as your being lives, since יהוה has withheld you from blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my master, be as Naval.
\v 27 Now this present which your servant has brought to my master, let it be given to the young men who follow my master.
\v 28 Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid. For יהוה will certainly make for my master a faithful house, because my master fights the battles of יהוה; and evil shall not be found in you all your days.
\v 29 Though men may rise up to pursue you, and to seek your being, yet the being of my master shall be bound in the bundle of life with יהוה your Elohim. He will sling out the beings of your enemies, as from the palm of a sling.
\v 30 It shall come to pass, when יהוה has done to my master according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you prince over Yisra'el,
\v 31 that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my master, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my master has avenged himself. When יהוה has dealt well with my master, then remember your handmaid."
\p
\v 32 David said to Avigayil, "Blessed is יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, who sent you today to meet me!
\v 33 Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, that have kept me from blood-guiltiness today, and from avenging myself with my own hand.
\v 34 For indeed, as יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, lives, who has withheld me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Naval by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall."
\v 35 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, "Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request."
\p
\v 36 Avigayil came to Naval; and behold, he held a banquet in his house, like the banquet of a king. Naval's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken. Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
\v 37 It happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Naval, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
\v 38 It happened about ten days after, that יהוה struck Naval, so that he died.
\p
\v 39 When David heard that Naval was dead, he said, "Blessed is יהוה, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Naval, and has kept back his servant from evil. יהוה has returned the evildoing of Naval on his own head." David sent and spoke concerning Avigayil, to take her to him as wife.
\v 40 When the servants of David had come to Avigayil to Karmel, they spoke to her, saying, "David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife."
\v 41 She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, "Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my master."
\v 42 Avigayil hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
\v 43 David also took Aḥinoam of Yizre'el; and they both became his wives.
\v 44 Now Sha'ul had given Mikhal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 The Ziphites came to Sha'ul to Givah, saying, "Does not David hide himself in the hill of Ḥakilah, which is before the desert?"
\v 2 Then Sha'ul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Yisra'el with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\v 3 Sha'ul encamped in the hill of Ḥakilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Sha'ul came after him into the wilderness.
\v 4 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Sha'ul had certainly come.
\v 5 David arose, and came to the place where Sha'ul had encamped; and David saw the place where Sha'ul lay, and Avner the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and Sha'ul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him.
\p
\v 6 Then answered David and said to Aḥimelekh the Ḥittite, and to Avishai the son of Tseruyah, brother to Yoav, saying, "Who will go down with me to Sha'ul to the camp?" Avishai said, "I will go down with you."
\v 7 So David and Avishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Sha'ul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Avner and the people lay around him.
\v 8 Then Avishai said to David, "Elohim has delivered up your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time."
\p
\v 9 David said to Avishai, "Do not destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against the anointed of יהוה, and be guiltless?"
\v 10 David said, "As יהוה lives, יהוה will strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.
\v 11 יהוה forbid that I should put forth my hand against the anointed of יהוה; but now please take the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go."
\v 12 So David took the spear and the jar of water from Sha'ul's head; and they went away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from יהוה was fallen on them.
\p
\v 13 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;
\v 14 and David cried to the people, and to Avner the son of Ner, saying, "Do not you answer, Avner?" Then Avner answered, "Who are you who cries to the king?"
\v 15 David said to Avner, "Are you not a man? Who is like you in Yisra'el? Why then have you not kept watch over your master, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your master.
\v 16 This thing is not good that you have done. As יהוה lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your master, the anointed of יהוה. Now see where the king's spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head."
\p
\v 17 Sha'ul knew David's voice, and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" David said, "It is my voice, my master, O king."
\v 18 He said, "Why does my master pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?
\v 19 Now therefore, please let my master the king hear the words of his servant. If it is so that יהוה has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, they are cursed before יהוה; for they have driven me out today that I should not cling to the inheritance of יהוה, saying, 'Go, serve other elohim!'
\v 20 Now therefore, do not let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of יהוה; for the king of Yisra'el has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains."
\p
\v 21 Then Sha'ul said, "I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my being was precious in your eyes today. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
\v 22 David answered, "Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and get it.
\v 23 יהוה will render to every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; because יהוה delivered you into my hand today, and I would not put forth my hand against the anointed of יהוה.
\v 24 Behold, as your being was respected today in my eyes, so let my being be respected in the eyes of יהוה, and let Him deliver me out of all oppression."
\v 25 Then Sha'ul said to David, "You are blessed, my son David. You shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail." So David went his way, and Sha'ul returned to his place.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 David said in his heart, "I shall now perish one day by the hand of Sha'ul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Sha'ul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Yisra'el. So shall I escape out of his hand."
\v 2 David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Akish the son of Maok, king of Gath.
\v 3 David lived with Akish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Aḥinoam the Yizre'elitess, and Avigayil the Karmelitess, Naval's wife.
\v 4 It was told Sha'ul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
\p
\v 5 David said to Akish, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?"
\v 6 Then Akish gave him Tsiqlag that day: that is why Tsiqlag pertains to the kings of Yehudah to this day.
\v 7 The full number of days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a time and four new moons.
\p
\v 8 David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amaleqites; for those nations were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 9 David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the cattle, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned, and came to Akish.
\v 10 Akish said, "Against whom have you made a raid today?" David said, "Against the South of Yehudah, against the South of the Yeraḥme'elites, and against the South of the Qenites."
\p
\v 11 David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, "Lest they should tell of us, saying, 'So did David, and so has been his judgment all the while he has lived in the country of the Philistines.'"
\v 12 Akish believed David, saying, "He has made his people Yisra'el utterly to abhor him. Therefore he shall be my servant forever."
\c 28
\p
\v 1 It happened in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Yisra'el. Akish said to David, "Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army, you and your men."
\v 2 David said to Akish, "Therefore you shall know what your servant will do." Akish said to David, "Therefore will I make you the guard of my head for ever."
\p
\v 3 Now Shemu'el was dead, and all Yisra'el had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. Sha'ul had put away the mediums, and the spiritists, out of the land.
\v 4 The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Sha'ul gathered all Yisra'el together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
\v 5 When Sha'ul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
\v 6 When Sha'ul inquired of יהוה, יהוה did not answer him, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\v 7 Then Sha'ul said to his servants, "Seek me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her, and inquire of her." His servants said to him, "Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at Endor."
\p
\v 8 Sha'ul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, "Please divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whoever I shall name to you."
\p
\v 9 The woman said to him, "Behold, you know what Sha'ul has done, how he has cut off the mediums, and the spiritists, out of the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my being, to cause me to die?"
\p
\v 10 Sha'ul swore to her by יהוה, saying, "As יהוה lives, no iniquity shall happen to you for this thing."
\v 11 Then the woman said, "Whom shall I bring up to you?" He said, "Bring Shemu'el up for me."
\p
\v 12 When the woman saw Shemu'el, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Sha'ul, saying, "Why have you deceived me? For you are Sha'ul!"
\p
\v 13 The king said to her, "Do not be afraid. For what do you see?" The woman said to Sha'ul, "I have seen elohim coming up out of the earth."
\v 14 He said to her, "What does he look like?" She said, "An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe." Sha'ul perceived that it was Shemu'el, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
\p
\v 15 Shemu'el said to Sha'ul, "Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?" Sha'ul answered, "I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and Elohim has departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do."
\v 16 Shemu'el said, "Why then do you ask of me, since יהוה has departed from you and has become your adversary?
\v 17 יהוה has done to you as He spoke by me. יהוה has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David.
\v 18 Because you did not obey the voice of יהוה, and did not execute His fierce wrath on Amaleq, therefore יהוה has done this thing to you today.
\v 19 Moreover יהוה will deliver Yisra'el also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. יהוה will deliver the army of Yisra'el also into the hand of the Philistines."
\p
\v 20 Then Sha'ul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of the words of Shemu'el. There was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
\v 21 The woman came to Sha'ul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, "Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my palm, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.
\v 22 Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way."
\p
\v 23 But he refused, and said, "I will not eat." But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.
\v 24 The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.
\v 25 She brought it before Sha'ul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Apheq: and the Yisra'elites encamped by the spring which is in Yizre'el.
\v 2 The chiefs of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Akish.
\v 3 Then the princes of the Philistines said, "What about these Hebrews?" Akish said to the princes of the Philistines, "Is this not David, the servant of Sha'ul the king of Yisra'el, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away to this day?"
\v 4 But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, "Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what should this fellow reconcile himself to his master? Should it not be with the heads of these men?
\p
\v 5 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, 'Sha'ul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands'?"
\p
\v 6 Then Akish called David, and said to him, "As יהוה lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the chiefs do not favor you.
\v 7 Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease the chiefs of the Philistines."
\v 8 David said to Akish, "But what have I done? What have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my master the king?"
\v 9 Akish answered David, "I know that you are good in my sight, as a messenger of Elohim. Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'
\v 10 Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your master who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart."
\v 11 So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Yizre'el.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 It happened, when David and his men were come to Tsiqlag on the third day, that the Amaleqites had made a raid on the South, and on Tsiqlag, and had struck Tsiqlag, and burned it with fire,
\v 2 and had taken captive the women and all who were therein, both small and great. They did not kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.
\v 3 When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.
\v 4 Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
\v 5 David's two wives were taken captive, Aḥinoam the Yizre'elitess, and Avigayil the wife of Naval the Karmelite.
\v 6 David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the being of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in יהוה his Elohim.
\p
\v 7 David said to Evyathar the priest, the son of Aḥimelekh, "Please bring me here the ephod." Evyathar brought the ephod to David.
\v 8 David inquired of יהוה, saying, "If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them?" He answered him, "Pursue; for you shall surely overtake them, and shall without fail recover all."
\v 9 So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the wadi Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
\v 10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the wadi Besor.
\v 11 They found a Mitsrite in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.
\v 12 They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
\p
\v 13 David asked him, "To whom do you belong? Where are you from?" He said, "I am a young man of Mitsrayim, servant to an Amaleqite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
\v 14 We made a raid on the South of the Kerethites, and on that which belongs to Yehudah, and on the South of Kalev; and we burned Tsiqlag with fire."
\v 15 David said to him, "Will you bring me down to this troop?" He said, "Swear to me by Elohim that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop."
\p
\v 16 When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Yehudah.
\v 17 David struck them from twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.
\v 18 David recovered all that the Amaleqites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.
\v 19 There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them. David brought back all.
\v 20 David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, "This is David's spoil."
\p
\v 21 David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the wadi Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them.
\p
\v 22 Then all the wicked men and worthless, of those who went with David, answered and said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart."
\v 23 Then David said, "You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which יהוה has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.
\v 24 Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike."
\v 25 It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and a judgment for Yisra'el to this day.
\v 26 When David came to Tsiqlag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Yehudah, even to his friends, saying, "Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of יהוה."
\p
\v 27 He sent it to those who were in Beth-El, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South, and to those who were in Yattir,
\v 28 and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,
\v 29 and to those who were in Rakal, and to those who were in the cities of the Yeraḥme'elites, and to those who were in the cities of the Qenites,
\v 30 and to those who were in Ḥormah, and to those who were in Borashan, and to those who were in Athaḥ,
\c 31
\p
\v 1 and to those who were in Ḥevron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.
\p
\v 31 Now the Philistines fought against Yisra'el: and the men of Yisra'el fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.
\v 2 The Philistines followed hard on Sha'ul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Yehonathan, and Avinadav, and Malkishua, the sons of Sha'ul.
\v 3 The battle went hard against Sha'ul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.
\v 4 Then Sha'ul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!" But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Sha'ul took his sword, and fell on it.
\v 5 When his armor bearer saw that Sha'ul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him.
\p
\v 6 So Sha'ul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.
\v 7 When the men of Yisra'el who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Yarden, saw that the men of Yisra'el fled, and that Sha'ul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
\v 8 It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Sha'ul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
\v 9 They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.
\v 10 They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.
\p
\v 11 When the inhabitants of Yavesh Gilad heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Sha'ul,
\v 12 all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Sha'ul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Yavesh, and burned them there.
\v 13 They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Yavesh, and fasted seven days.
