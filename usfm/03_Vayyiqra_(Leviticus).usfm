\v 1 And יהוה called\f + \fr 1:1 \ft The Hebrew word here is ויקרא (vayyiqra) which means "and he called." In the Hebrew text, the Alef (א) at the end is written to be smaller than the other letters. The scribes that wrote the text down through the ages have continued writing it this way as a means to indicate something special about the word. In this case, it is believed to highlight the fact that the word used is vayyiqra and not vayyiqar, which is spelled the same minus the Alef. While vayyiqra means "and he called," vayyiqar means "and he encountered" and is therefore less personal. It is believed that the writing here is used to indicate how the encounter between יהוה and Mosheh was more than just a "chance encounter" and that יהוה instead "called" Mosheh.\f* to Mosheh and spoke to him from the Tent of Appointment, saying,

\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el and say to them, 'When any man of you brings an offering to יהוה, you shall bring your offering of animals from the herd or the flock.
\v 3 If his offering is an ascension offering from the herd, he shall offer it, a male without defect; he shall offer it at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, so that he shall be accepted before יהוה.
\v 4 He shall lay his hand on the head of the ascension offering, so that it shall be accepted for him to make atonement on his behalf.
\v 5 He shall slay the young bull before יהוה; and Aharon's sons the priests shall offer up the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 6 He shall then skin the ascension offering and cut it into its pieces.
\v 7 The sons of Aharon the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
\v 8 Then Aharon's sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head and the suet\f + \fr 1:8 \fk Suet \ft The raw, hard fat of beef or mutton found around the loins and kidneys.\f* over the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar.
\rem Added clarifying footnote explaining the meaning of 'suet', a rather uncommon word. (Johan Thorén 2018-04-17 10:16 CET)
\v 9 Its entrails, however, and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer up in smoke all of it on the altar for an ascension offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to יהוה.

\v 10 But if his offering is from the flock, of the sheep or of the goats, for an ascension offering, he shall offer it a male without defect.
\v 11 He shall slay it on the side of the altar northward before יהוה, and Aharon's sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.
\v 12 He shall then cut it into its pieces with its head and its suet, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar.
\v 13 The entrails, however, and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer all of it, and offer it up in smoke on the altar; it is an ascension offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\v 14 But if his offering to יהוה is an ascension offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering from the turtledoves or from young pigeons.
\v 15 The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head and offer it up in smoke on the altar; and its blood is to be drained out on the side of the altar.
\v 16 He shall also take away its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar eastward, to the place of the ashes.

\v 1 And when a being presents a grain offering as an offering to יהוה, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it.

And the priest shall offer \add it\add* up in smoke \add as\add* its memorial portion on the altar, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\v 3 The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aharon and his sons: a thing most set-apart, of the offerings to יהוה by fire.
\p
\v 4 Now when you bring an offering of a grain offering baked in an oven, \add it shall be\add* unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.
\v 5 If your offering is a grain offering \add made\add* on the griddle, \add it shall be\add* of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil;
\v 6 you shall break it into bits and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
\v 7 Now if your offering is a grain offering \add made\add* in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
\v 8 When you bring in the grain offering which is made of these things to יהוה, it shall be presented to the priest and he shall bring it to the altar.
\v 9 The priest then shall take up from the grain offering its memorial portion, and shall offer \add it\add* up in smoke on the altar \add as\add* an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\v 10 The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aharon and his sons: a thing most set-apart of the offerings to יהוה by fire.

\v 11 No grain offering, which you bring to יהוה, shall be made with leaven, for you shall not offer up in smoke any leaven or any honey as an offering by fire to יהוה.
\v 12 As an offering of first fruits you shall bring them to יהוה, but they shall not ascend for a soothing aroma on the altar.
\v 13 Every grain offering of yours, moreover, you shall season with salt, so that the salt of the covenant of your Elohim shall not cease from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt.

\v 14 Also if you bring a grain offering of early ripened things to יהוה, you shall bring aviv\f + \fr 2:14 \fk Aviv \ft That is, fresh and green.\f* grain roasted in the fire, grits of new growth, for the grain offering of your early ripened things.

\v 1 Now if his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he is going to offer out of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without defect before יהוה.
\v 2 He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slay it at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, and Aharon's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood around on the altar.
\v 3 From the sacrifice of the peace offerings he shall present an offering by fire to יהוה, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,

\v 7 If he is going to offer a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before יהוה,
\v 8 and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slay it before the Tent of Appointment, and Aharon's sons shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.
\v 9 From the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall bring as an offering by fire to יהוה, its fat, the entire fat tail which he shall remove close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,

\v 1 Then יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying, 'If a person sins unknowingly in any of the things which יהוה has commanded not to be done, and commits any of them,
\v 3 if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer to יהוה a bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed.
\v 4 He shall bring the bull to the doorway of the Tent of Appointment before יהוה, and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull and slay the bull before יהוה.
\v 5 Then the anointed priest is to take some of the blood of the bull and bring it to the Tent of Appointment,
\v 6 and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before יהוה, in front of the veil of the set-apart place.
\v 7 The priest shall also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense which is before יהוה in the Tent of Appointment; and all the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of ascension offering which is at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 8 He shall remove from it all the fat of the bull of the sin offering: the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails,
\v 9 and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys
\v 10 (just as it is removed from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings), and the priest is to offer them up in smoke on the altar of ascension offering.
\v 11 But the hide of the bull and all its flesh with its head and its legs and its entrails and its refuse,
\v 12 that is, all \add the rest of\add* the bull, he is to bring out to a clean place outside the camp where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.
\p
\v 13 Now if the whole congregation of Yisra'el commits error and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they commit any of the things which יהוה has commanded not to be done, and they become guilty;
\v 14 when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the assembly shall offer a bull of the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the Tent of Appointment.
\v 15 Then the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before יהוה, and the bull shall be slain before יהוה.
\v 16 Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the blood of the bull to the Tent of Appointment;
\v 17 and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle \add it\add* seven times before יהוה, in front of the veil.
\v 18 He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before יהוה in the Tent of Appointment; and all the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of ascension offering which is at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 19 He shall remove all its fat from it and offer it up in smoke on the altar.
\v 20 He shall also do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering; thus he shall do with it. So the priest shall make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.
\v 21 Then he is to bring out the bull to \add a place\add* outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
\p
\v 22 When a leader sins and unknowingly does any one of all the things which יהוה his Elohim has commanded not to be done, and he becomes guilty,
\v 23 if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without defect.
\v 24 He shall lay his hand on the head of the male goat and slay it in the place where they slay the ascension offering before יהוה; it is a sin offering.
\v 25 Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of ascension offering; and \add the rest of\add* its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of ascension offering.
\v 26 All its fat he shall offer up in smoke on the altar as \add in the case of\add* the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin, and he will be forgiven.
\p
\v 27 Now if anyone of the common people sins unknowingly in doing any of the things which יהוה has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty,
\v 28 if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without defect, for his sin which he has committed.
\v 29 He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay the sin offering at the place of the ascension offering.
\v 30 The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of ascension offering; and all \add the rest of\add* its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.
\v 31 Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat was removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar for a soothing aroma to יהוה. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.
\p
\v 32 But if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring it, a female without defect.
\v 33 He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they slay the ascension offering.
\v 34 The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of ascension offering, and all \add the rest of\add* its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.
\v 35 Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, and the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar, on the offerings by fire to יהוה. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven.

\v 1 And if a being sins after he hears a public adjuration \add to testify\add* when he is a witness, whether he has seen or \add otherwise\add* known, if he does not tell \add it\add*, then he will bear his iniquity.
\v 2 Or if a person touches any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean beast or the carcass of unclean cattle or a carcass of unclean swarming things, though it is hidden from him and he is unclean, then he will be guilty.
\v 3 Or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever \add sort\add* his uncleanness \add may\add* be with which he becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know \add it\add*, he will be guilty.
\v 4 Or if a person swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil or to do good, in whatever matter a man shall speak thoughtlessly with an oath, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know \add it\add*, he will be guilty in one of these.
\v 5 So it shall be when he becomes guilty in one of these, that he shall confess that in which he has sinned.
\v 6 He shall also bring his guilt offering to יהוה for his sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin [which he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven].\f + \fr 5:6 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading present in the DSS, Sam., and the LXX but absent from the Heb.

\v 7 But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to יהוה his guilt offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for an ascension offering.
\v 8 He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first that which is for the sin offering and shall nip its head at the front of its neck, but he shall not sever \add it\add*.
\v 9 He shall also sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin offering.
\v 10 The second he shall then prepare as an ascension offering according to the judgment. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin which he has committed, and it will be forgiven him.
\p
\v 11 But if his means are insufficient for two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then for his offering for that which he has sinned, he shall bring the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall not put oil on it or place incense on it, for it is a sin offering.
\v 12 He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as its memorial portion and offer \add it\add* up in smoke on the altar, with the offerings of יהוה by fire: it is a sin offering.
\v 13 So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has committed from one of these, and it will be forgiven him; then \add the rest\add* shall become the priest's, like the grain offering.'"

\v 14 Then יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 15 "If a being acts treacherously and sins unknowingly against the set-apart things of יהוה, then he shall bring his guilt offering to יהוה: a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation in silver by sheqels, in \add terms of\add* the sheqel of the set-apart place, for a guilt offering.
\v 16 He shall make restitution for that which he has sinned against the set-apart thing, and shall add to it a fifth part of it and give it to the priest. The priest shall then make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and it will be forgiven him.
\p
\v 17 "Now if a person sins and does any of the things which יהוה has commanded not to be done, though he was unaware, still he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity.
\v 18 He is then to bring to the priest a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his error in which he sinned unknowingly and did not know \add it\add*, and it will be forgiven him.
\v 19 It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before יהוה."

\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "When a person sins and acts treacherously against יהוה, and deceives his companion in regard to a deposit or a security entrusted \add to him\add*, or through robbery, or \add if\add* he has oppressed his companion,
\v 3 or has found what was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, so that he sins in regard to any one of the things a man may do;
\v 4 then it shall be, when he sins and becomes guilty, that he shall restore what he took by robbery or what he got by oppression, or the deposit which was entrusted to him or the lost thing which he found,
\v 5 or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more. He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day \add he presents\add* his guilt offering.
\v 6 Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to יהוה, a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering,
\v 7 and the priest shall make atonement for him before יהוה, and he will be forgiven for any one of the things which he may have done to incur guilt."
\p
\v 8 Then יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 9 "Command Aharon and his sons, saying, 'This is the Torah for the ascension offering: the ascension offering itself shall \add remain on\add* the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire on the altar is to be kept burning on it.
\v 10 The priest is to put on his linen robe, and he shall put on undergarments next to his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes \add to\add* which the fire reduces the ascension offering on the altar and place them beside the altar.
\v 11 Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
\v 12 The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not go out, but the priest shall burn wood on it every morning; and he shall lay out the ascension offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it.
\v 13 Fire shall be kept burning continually on the altar; it is not to go out.
\p
\v 14 Now this is the Torah of the grain offering: the sons of Aharon shall present it before יהוה in front of the altar.
\v 15 Then one \add of them\add* shall lift up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, with its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering, and he shall offer \add it\add* up in smoke on the altar, a soothing aroma, as its memorial offering to יהוה.
\v 16 What is left of it Aharon and his sons are to eat. It shall be eaten as unleavened cakes in a set-apart place; they are to eat it in the court of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 17 It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their share from My offerings by fire; it is most set-apart, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
\v 18 Every male among the sons of Aharon shall eat it; it is a permanent ordinance throughout your generations, from the offerings by fire to יהוה. Whoever touches them will become set apart.'"
\p
\v 19 Then יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 20 "This is the offering which Aharon and his sons are to present to יהוה on the day when he is anointed; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.
\v 21 It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle. When it is \add well\add* stirred, you shall bring it. You shall present the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\v 22 The anointed priest who will be in his place among his sons shall offer it. By a permanent ordinance it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to יהוה.
\v 23 So every grain offering of the priest shall be burned entirely. It shall not be eaten."
\p
\v 24 Then יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 25 "Speak to Aharon and to his sons, saying, 'This is the Torah of the sin offering: in the place where the ascension offering is slain the sin offering shall be slain before יהוה; it is most set-apart.
\v 26 The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a set-apart place, in the court of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 27 Anyone who touches its flesh will become set apart; and when any of its blood splashes on a garment, in a set-apart place you shall wash what was splashed on.
\v 28 Also the earthenware vessel in which it was cooked shall be broken; and if it was cooked in a copper vessel, then it shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
\v 29 Every male among the priests shall eat of it; it is most set-apart.
\v 30 But no sin offering of which any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Appointment to make atonement in the set-apart place shall be eaten; it shall be burned with fire.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 And this is the Torah of the guilt offering; it is most set-apart.
\v 2 In the place where they slay the ascension offering they are to slay the guilt offering, and he shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.
\v 3 Then he shall offer from it all its fat: the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails,
\v 4 and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe on the liver he shall remove with the kidneys.
\v 5 The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to יהוה; it is a guilt offering.
\v 6 Every male among the priests shall eat of it. It shall be eaten in a set-apart place; it is most set-apart.
\v 7 The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is one Torah for them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
\v 8 Also the priest who presents any man's ascension offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the ascension offering which he has presented.
\v 9 Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in the oven and everything prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who presents it.
\v 10 Every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aharon, to all alike.
\p
\v 11 Now this is the Torah of the sacrifice of peace offerings which shall be presented to יהוה.
\v 12 If he offers it by way of thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes \add of well\add* stirred fine flour mixed with oil.
\v 13 With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving, he shall present his offering with cakes of leavened bread.
\v 14 Of this he shall present one of every offering as a contribution to יהוה; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.
\p
\v 15 Now \add as for\add* the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings, it shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it over until morning.
\v 16 But if the sacrifice of his offering is a \add for\add* a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what is left of it shall be eaten;
\v 17 but what is left over from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.
\v 18 So if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings should \add ever\add* be eaten on the third day, he who offers it will not be accepted, \add and\add* it will not be reckoned to his \add benefit\add*. It shall be an offensive thing, and the being who eats of it will bear his iniquity.
\p
\v 19 Also the flesh that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. As for \add other\add* flesh, anyone who is clean shall eat \add such\add* flesh.
\v 20 But the being who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to יהוה, in his uncleanness, that being shall be cut off from his people.
\v 21 When a being touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, or an unclean animal, or any unclean detestable \add thing\add*, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to יהוה, that being shall be cut off from his people.'"
\p
\v 22 Then יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 23 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying, 'You shall not eat any fat \add from\add* an ox, a sheep or a goat.
\v 24 Also the fat of \add an animal\add* which dies and the fat of an animal torn \add by beasts\add* may be put to any other use, but you must certainly not eat it.
\v 25 For whoever eats the fat of the animal from which an offering by fire is offered to יהוה, even the person who eats shall be cut off from his people.
\v 26 You are not to eat any blood, either of bird or animal, in any of your dwellings.
\v 27 Any person who eats any blood, even that person shall be cut off from his people.'"
\p
\v 28 Then יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 29 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying, 'He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to יהוה shall bring his offering to יהוה from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
\v 30 His own hands are to bring offerings by fire to יהוה. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be presented as a wave offering before יהוה.
\v 31 The priest shall offer up the fat in smoke on the altar, but the breast shall belong to Aharon and his sons.
\v 32 You shall give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
\v 33 The one among the sons of Aharon who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, the right thigh shall be his as \add his\add* portion.
\v 34 For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the children of Yisra'el from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aharon the priest and to his sons as \add their\add* due forever from the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 35 This is that which is set apart to Aharon and that which is set apart to his sons from the offerings by fire to יהוה, in that day when he presented them to serve as priests to יהוה.
\v 36 These יהוה had commanded to be given them from the children of Yisra'el in the day that He anointed them. It is \add their\add* due forever throughout their generations.'"
\p
\v 37 This is the Torah of the ascension offering, the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering and the ordination offering\f + \fr 7:37 \ft Ordination offering – See Shemoth 29:22-34.\f* and the sacrifice of peace offerings,
\v 38 which יהוה commanded Mosheh at Mount Sinai in the day that He commanded the children of Yisra'el to present their offerings to יהוה in the wilderness of Sinai.

\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Take Aharon and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread,
\v 3 and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment."
\v 4 So Mosheh did just as יהוה commanded him. When the congregation was assembled at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment,
\v 5 Mosheh said to the congregation, "This is the thing which יהוה has commanded to do."
\p
\v 6 Then Mosheh had Aharon and his sons come near and washed them with water.
\v 7 He put the tunic on him and girded him with the sash, and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the artistic band of the ephod, with which he tied it to him.
\v 8 He then placed the breastplate on him, and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.
\v 9 He also placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the set-apart crown, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 10 Mosheh then took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and all that was in it, and set them apart.
\v 11 He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to set them apart.
\v 12 Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aharon's head and anointed him, to set him apart.
\v 13 Next Mosheh had Aharon's sons come near and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with sashes and bound caps on them, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 14 Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
\v 15 Next Mosheh slaughtered it and took the blood and with his finger put some of it around on the horns of the altar, and purified the altar. Then he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and set it apart, to make atonement for it.
\v 16 He also took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat; and Mosheh offered it up in smoke on the altar.
\v 17 But the bull and its hide and its flesh and its refuse he burned in the fire outside the camp, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 18 Then he presented the ram of the ascension offering, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
\v 19 Mosheh slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
\v 20 When he had cut the ram into its pieces, Mosheh offered up the head and the pieces and the suet in smoke.
\v 21 After he had washed the entrails and the legs with water, Mosheh offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was an ascension offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to יהוה, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 22 Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
\v 23 Mosheh slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aharon's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
\v 24 He also had Aharon's sons come near; and Mosheh put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. Mosheh then sprinkled the rest of the blood around on the altar.
\v 25 He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.
\p
\v 26 From the basket of unleavened bread that was before יהוה, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread mixed with oil and one wafer, and placed them on the portions of fat and on the right thigh.
\v 27 He then put all these on the hands of Aharon and on the hands of his sons and presented them as a wave offering before יהוה.
\v 28 Then Mosheh took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the ascension offering. They were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to יהוה.
\v 29 Mosheh also took the breast and presented it for a wave offering before יהוה; it was Mosheh's portion of the ram of ordination, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 30 So Mosheh took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aharon, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he set Aharon apart, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
\p
\v 31 Then Mosheh said to Aharon and to his sons, "Cook the flesh at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, and eat it there together with the bread which is in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, 'Aharon and his sons shall eat it.'
\v 32 The remainder of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in the fire.
\v 33 You shall not go outside the doorway of the Tent of Appointment for seven days, until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled; for he will ordain you through seven days.
\v 34 יהוה has commanded to do as has been done today, to make atonement on your behalf.
\v 35 At the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, moreover, you shall remain day and night for seven days and guard the charge of יהוה, so that you will not die, for so I have been commanded."
\v 36 Thus Aharon and his sons did all the things which יהוה had commanded through Mosheh.
\c 9
פרשת שמיני – Parashat Shemini
\p
\v 1 Now it came about on the eighth day that Mosheh called Aharon and his sons and the elders of Yisra'el;
\v 2 and he said to Aharon, "Take for yourself a calf, a bull, for a sin offering and a ram for an ascension offering, both without defect, and offer them before יהוה.
\v 3 Then to the children of Yisra'el you shall speak, saying, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without defect, for an ascension offering,
\v 4 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to slaughter before יהוה, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today יהוה will appear to you.'"
\v 5 So they took what Mosheh had commanded to the front of the Tent of Appointment, and the whole congregation came near and stood before יהוה.
\v 6 Mosheh said, "This is the thing which יהוה has commanded you to do, that the glory of יהוה may appear to you."
\v 7 Mosheh then said to Aharon, "Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your ascension offering, that you shall make atonement for yourself and for the people; then make the offering for the people, that you shall make atonement for them, just as יהוה has commanded."
\p
\v 8 So Aharon came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself.
\v 9 Aharon's sons presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put some on the horns of the altar, and poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 10 The fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering, he then offered up in smoke on the altar just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 11 The flesh and the skin, however, he burned with fire outside the camp.
\p
\v 12 Then he slaughtered the ascension offering; and Aharon's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
\v 13 They handed the ascension offering to him in pieces, with the head, and he offered them up in smoke on the altar.
\v 14 He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered them up in smoke with the ascension offering on the altar.
\p
\v 15 Then he presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first.
\v 16 He also presented the ascension offering, and offered it according to the judgment.
\v 17 Next he presented the grain offering, and filled his hand with some of it and offered it up in smoke on the altar, besides the ascension offering of the morning.
\p
\v 18 Then he slew the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aharon's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
\v 19 As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram, the fat tail, and the fat covering, and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver,
\v 20 they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and he offered them up in smoke on the altar.
\v 21 But the breasts and the right thigh Aharon presented as a wave offering before יהוה, just as Mosheh had commanded.
\p
\v 22 Then Aharon lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he stepped down after making the sin offering and the ascension offering and the peace offerings.
\v 23 Mosheh and Aharon went into the Tent of Appointment. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of יהוה appeared to all the people.
\v 24 Then fire came out from before יהוה and consumed the ascension offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw, they shouted and fell on their faces.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now Nadav and Avihu, the [two] sons of Aharon, took their respective censers, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on it and offered strange fire before יהוה, which He had not commanded them.
\v 2 And fire came out from the presence of יהוה and consumed them, and they died before יהוה.
\p
\v 3 Then Mosheh said to Aharon, "It is what יהוה spoke, saying, 'By those who come near Me I will be treated as set-apart, and before all the people I will be honored.'" So Aharon, therefore, kept silent.
\p
\v 4 Mosheh called also to Misha'el and Eltsaphan, the sons of Aharon's uncle Uzzi'el, and said to them, "Come forward, carry your relatives away from the front of the set-apart place to the outside of the camp."
\v 5 So they came forward and carried them still in their tunics to the outside of the camp, as Mosheh had said.
\v 6 Then Mosheh said to Aharon and to his sons Elazar and Ithamar, "Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, so that you will not die and that He will not become wrathful against all the congregation. But your kinsmen, the whole house of Yisra'el, shall bewail the burning which יהוה has brought about.
\v 7 You shall not even go out from the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, or you will die; for the anointing oil of יהוה is upon you." So they did according to the word of Mosheh.
\p
\v 8 יהוה then spoke to Aharon, saying,
\v 9 "When you come to the into the Tent of Appointment, do not drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, so that you will not die-- it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations--
\v 10 and so as to make a distinction between the set-apart and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean,
\v 11 and so as to teach the children of Yisra'el all the statutes which יהוה has spoken to them through Mosheh."
\p
\v 12 Then Mosheh spoke to Aharon, and to his surviving sons, Elazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering that is left over from offerings by fire of יהוה and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most set-apart.
\v 13 You shall eat it, moreover, in a set-apart place, because it is your due and your sons' due out of offerings by fire of יהוה; for thus I have been commanded.
\v 14 The breast of the wave offering, however, and the thigh of the offering you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your due and your sons' due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 15 The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving they shall bring along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat, to present as a wave offering before יהוה; so it shall be a thing perpetually due you and your sons with you, just as יהוה has commanded."
\p
\v 16 But Mosheh searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up! So he was angry with Aharon's surviving sons Elazar and Ithamar, saying,
\v 17 "Why did you not eat the sin offering at the set-apart place? For it is most set-apart, and He gave it to you to bear away the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before יהוה.
\v 18 Behold, since its blood had not been brought inside, into the set-apart place, you should certainly have eaten it in the set-apart place, just as I commanded."
\v 19 But Aharon spoke to Mosheh, "Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their ascension offering before יהוה. When things like these happened to me, if I had eaten a sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight of יהוה?"
\v 20 When Mosheh heard this, it seemed good in his eyes.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke again to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying to them,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying, 'These are the creatures which you shall eat from all the animals that are on the earth.
\v 3 Whatever divides a hoof, thus making split hoofs, and chews the cud, among the animals, that you shall eat.
\v 4 Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these, among those which chew the cud, or among those which divide the hoof: the camel, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you.
\v 5 Likewise, the shaphan, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;
\v 6 the rabbit also, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;
\v 7 and the pig, for though it divides the hoof, thus making a split hoof, it does not chew cud, it is unclean to you.
\v 8 You shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.
\p
\v 9 These you shall eat, whatever is in the water: all that have fins and scales, those in the water, in the seas or in the wadis, you shall eat.
\v 10 But whatever is in the seas and in the wadis that does not have fins and scales among all the teeming life of the water, and among all the living creatures that are in the water, they are detestable to you,
\v 11 and they shall be detestable to you; you shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you shall detest.
\v 12 Whatever in the water does not have fins and scales is detestable to you.
\p
\v 13 These, moreover, you shall detest among the birds; they are detestable, not to be eaten: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard,
\v 14 and the kite and the falcon in its kind,
\v 15 every raven in its kind,
\v 16 and the ostrich and the owl and the sea gull and the hawk in its kind,
\v 17 and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl,
\v 18 and the white owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture,
\v 19 and the stork, the heron in its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
\p
\v 20 All the winged insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you.
\v 21 Yet these you shall eat among all the winged insects which walk on all fours: those which have above their feet jointed legs with which to jump on the earth.
\v 22 These of them you shall eat: the locust in its kinds, and the devastating locust in its kinds, and the cricket in its kinds, and the grasshopper in its kinds.
\v 23 But all other winged insects which are four-footed are detestable to you.
\p
\v 24 By these, moreover, you will be made unclean: whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening,
\v 25 and whoever picks up any of their carcasses shall wash his clothes [and wash himself in water] and be unclean until evening.
\v 26 Concerning all the animals which divide the hoof but do not make a split hoof, or which do not chew cud, they are unclean to you: whoever touches them becomes unclean.
\v 27 Also whatever walks on its paws, among all the creatures that walk on all fours, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening,
\v 28 and the one who picks up their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; they are unclean to you.
\p
\v 29 Now these are to you the unclean among the swarming things which swarm on the earth: the mole, and the mouse, and the great lizard in its kinds,
\v 30 and the gecko, and the crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand reptile, and the chameleon.
\v 31 These are to you the unclean among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are dead becomes unclean until evening.
\v 32 Also anything on which one of them shall fall when they are dead becomes unclean, including any wooden article, or clothing, or a skin, or a sack-- any article of which use is made-- it shall be put in the water and be unclean until evening, then it becomes clean.
\v 33 As for any earthenware vessel into which one of them shall fall, whatever is in it becomes unclean and you shall break the vessel.
\v 34 Any of the food which shall be eaten, on which water comes, shall become unclean, and any liquid which shall be drunk in every vessel shall become unclean.
\v 35 Everything, moreover, on which part of their carcass shall fall becomes unclean; an oven or a stove shall be smashed; they are unclean and shall continue as unclean to you.
\v 36 Nevertheless a spring or a cistern collecting water shall be clean, though the one who touches their carcass shall be unclean.
\v 37 If a part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing which is to be sown, it is clean.
\v 38 Though if water is put on the seed and a part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.
\p
\v 39 Also if one of the animals dies which you have for food, the one who touches its carcass becomes unclean until evening.
\v 40 He too, who eats some of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening, and the one who picks up its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening.
\p
\v 41 Now every swarming thing that swarms on the earth is detestable, not to be eaten.
\v 42 Whatever crawls on its belly, and whatever walks on all fours, whatever has many feet, in respect to every swarming thing that swarms on the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are detestable.
\v 43 Do not render yourselves detestable through any of the swarming things that swarm; and you shall not make yourselves unclean with them so that you become unclean.
\v 44 For I am יהוה your Elohim. Set yourselves apart therefore, and be set-apart, for I am set-apart. And you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that swarm on the earth.
\v 45 For I am יהוה who brought you up from the land of Mitsrayim to be your Elohim; thus you shall be set-apart, for I am set-apart.'"
\p
\v 46 This is the Torah regarding the animal and the bird, and every living thing that moves in the waters and everything that swarms on the earth,
\v 47 to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the edible creature and the creature which is not to be eaten.
\c 12
פרשת תזריע – Parashat Tazria
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying: 'When a woman gives birth and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean for seven days, as in the days of her menstrual illness she shall be unclean.
\v 3 On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
\v 4 Then she shall remain in the blood of her purification for thirty-three days; she shall not touch any set apart thing, nor enter the set-apart place until the days of her purification are completed.
\v 5 But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall remain in the blood of her purification for sixty-six days.
\p
\v 6 When the days of her purification are completed, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment a one year old lamb for an ascension offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.
\v 7 Then he shall offer it before יהוה and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the Torah for her who bears a child, whether a male or a female.
\v 8 But if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for an ascension offering and the other for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.'"
\c 13
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
\v 2 "When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling or a scab or a bright spot, and it becomes an infection of leprosy on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aharon the priest or to one of his sons the priests.
\v 3 The priest shall look at the mark on the skin of the body, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is an infection of leprosy; when the priest has looked at him, he shall pronounce him unclean.
\v 4 But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white, then the priest shall isolate him who has the infection for seven days.
\v 5 The priest shall look at him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the infection has not changed and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days.
\v 6 The priest shall look at him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and the mark has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a scab. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
\p
\v 7 "But if the scab spreads farther on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again to the priest.
\v 8 The priest shall look, and if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.
\p
\v 9 "When the infection of leprosy is on a man, then he shall be brought to the priest.
\v 10 The priest shall then look, and if there is a white swelling in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling,
\v 11 it is a chronic leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not isolate him, for he is unclean.
\v 12 If the leprosy breaks out farther on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of him who has the infection from his head even to his feet, as far as the priest can see,
\v 13 then the priest shall look, and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; it has all turned white and he is clean.
\v 14 But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.
\v 15 The priest shall look at the raw flesh, and he shall pronounce him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy.
\v 16 Or if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest,
\v 17 and the priest shall look at him, and behold, if the infection has turned to white, then the priest shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; he is clean.
\p
\v 18 "When the body has a boil on its skin and it is healed,
\v 19 and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white, bright spot, then it shall be shown to the priest;
\v 20 and the priest shall look, and behold, if it appears to be lower than the skin, and the hair on it has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the infection of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil.
\v 21 But if the priest looks at it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it and it is not lower than the skin and is faded, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days;
\v 22 and if it spreads farther on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection.
\v 23 But if the bright spot remains in its place and does not spread, it is only the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
\p
\v 24 "Or if the body sustains in its skin a burn by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white,
\v 25 then the priest shall look at it. And if the hair in the bright spot has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy; it has broken out in the burn. Therefore, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy.
\v 26 But if the priest looks at it, and indeed, there is no white hair in the bright spot and it is no deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days;
\v 27 and the priest shall look at him on the seventh day. If it spreads farther in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy.
\v 28 But if the bright spot remains in its place and has not spread in the skin, but is dim, it is the swelling from the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is only the scar of the burn.
\p
\v 29 "Now if a man or woman has an infection on the head or on the beard,
\v 30 then the priest shall look at the infection, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and there is thin yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scale, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
\v 31 But if the priest looks at the infection of the scale, and indeed, it appears to be no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate the person with the scaly infection for seven days.
\v 32 On the seventh day the priest shall look at the infection, and if the scale has not spread and no yellowish hair has grown in it, and the appearance of the scale is no deeper than the skin,
\v 33 then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the scale; and the priest shall isolate the person with the scale seven more days.
\v 34 Then on the seventh day the priest shall look at the scale, and if the scale has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
\v 35 But if the scale spreads farther in the skin after his cleansing,
\v 36 then the priest shall look at him, and if the scale has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellowish hair; he is unclean.
\v 37 If in his eyes the scale has remained, however, and black hair has grown in it, the scale has healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
\p
\v 38 "When a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, even white bright spots,
\v 39 then the priest shall look, and if the bright spots on the skin of their bodies are a faint white, it is eczema that has broken out on the skin; he is clean.
\p
\v 40 "Now if a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald; he is clean.
\v 41 If his head becomes bald at the front and sides, he is bald on the forehead; he is clean.
\v 42 But if on the bald head or the bald forehead, there occurs a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or on his bald forehead.
\v 43 Then the priest shall look at him; and if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,
\v 44 he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his infection is on his head.
\p
\v 45 "As for the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover his mustache and cry, 'Unclean! Unclean!'
\v 46 He shall remain unclean all the days during which he has the infection; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.
\p
\v 47 "When a garment has a mark of leprosy in it, whether it is a wool garment or a linen garment,
\v 48 whether in warp or mixture, of linen or of wool, whether in leather or in any article made of leather,
\v 49 if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, or in the warp or in the mixture, or in any article of leather, it is a leprous mark and shall be shown to the priest.
\v 50 Then the priest shall look at the mark and shall quarantine the article with the mark for seven days.
\v 51 He shall then look at the mark on the seventh day; if the mark has spread in the garment, whether in the warp or in the mixture or in the leather, whatever the purpose for which the leather is used, the mark is a leprous malignancy, it is unclean.
\v 52 So he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the mixture, in wool or in linen, or any article of leather in which the mark occurs, for it is a leprous malignancy; it shall be burned in the fire.
\p
\v 53 "But if the priest shall look, and indeed the mark has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the mixture, or in any article of leather,
\v 54 then the priest shall order them to wash the thing in which the mark occurs and he shall quarantine it for seven more days.
\v 55 After the article with the mark has been washed, the priest shall again look, and if the mark has not changed its appearance, even though the mark has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether an eating away has produced bareness on the top or on the front of it.
\p
\v 56 "Then if the priest looks, and if the mark has faded after it has been washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or out of the leather, whether from the warp or from the mixture;
\v 57 and if it appears again in the garment, whether in the warp or in the mixture, or in any article of leather, it is an outbreak; the article with the mark shall be burned in the fire.
\v 58 The garment, whether the warp or the mixture, or any article of leather from which the mark has departed when you washed it, it shall then be washed a second time and will be clean."
\p
\v 59 This is the Torah for the mark of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, whether in the warp or in the mixture, or in any article of leather, for pronouncing it clean or unclean.
\c 14
פרשת מצרע – Parashat Metsora
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "This shall be the Torah of the leper in the day of his cleansing. Now he shall be brought to the priest,
\v 3 and the priest shall go out to the outside of the camp. Thus the priest shall look, and if the infection of leprosy has been healed in the leper,
\v 4 then the priest shall give orders to take two live clean birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop for the one who is to be cleansed.
\v 5 The priest shall also give orders to slay the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
\v 6 As for the live bird, he shall take it together with the cedar wood and the scarlet string and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was slain over the running water.
\v 7 He shall then sprinkle seven times the one who is to be cleansed from the leprosy and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the live bird go free over the open field.
\v 8 The one to be cleansed shall then wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe in water and be clean. Now afterward, he shall enter the camp, but he shall stay outside his tent for seven days.
\v 9 It will be on the seventh day that he shall shave off all his hair: he shall shave his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair. He shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water and be clean.
\p
\v 10 "Now on the eighth day he is to take two male lambs without defect, and a yearling ewe lamb without defect, and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil;
\v 11 and the priest who pronounces him clean shall present the man to be cleansed and the aforesaid before יהוה at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 12 Then the priest shall take the one male lamb and bring it for a guilt offering, with the log of oil, and present them as a wave offering before יהוה.
\v 13 Next he shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the ascension offering, at the place of the set-apart place-- for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most set-apart.
\v 14 The priest shall then take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
\v 15 The priest shall also take some of the log of oil, and pour it into his left palm;
\v 16 the priest shall then dip his right-hand finger into the oil that is in his left palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of the oil seven times before יהוה.
\v 17 Of the remaining oil which is in his palm, the priest shall put some on the right ear lobe of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt offering;
\v 18 while the rest of the oil that is in the priest's palm, he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before יהוה.
\v 19 The priest shall next offer the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Then afterward, he shall slaughter the ascension offering.
\v 20 The priest shall offer up the ascension offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be clean.
\p
\v 21 "But if he is poor and his means are insufficient, then he is to take one male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering to make atonement for him, and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil,
\v 22 and two turtledoves or two young pigeons which are within his means, the one shall be a sin offering and the other an ascension offering.
\v 23 Then the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, before יהוה.
\v 24 The priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall offer them for a wave offering before יהוה.
\v 25 Next he shall slaughter the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
\v 26 The priest shall also pour some of the oil into his left palm;
\v 27 and with his right-hand finger the priest shall sprinkle some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before יהוה.
\v 28 The priest shall then put some of the oil that is in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt offering.
\v 29 Moreover, the rest of the oil that is in the priest's palm he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement on his behalf before יהוה.
\v 30 He shall then offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, which are within his means.
\v 31 He shall offer what he can afford, the one for a sin offering and the other for an ascension offering, together with the grain offering. So the priest shall make atonement before יהוה on behalf of the one to be cleansed.
\v 32 This is the Torah for him in whom there is an infection of leprosy, whose means are limited for his cleansing."
\p
\v 33 יהוה further spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying:
\p
\v 34 "When you enter the land of Kena'an, which I give you for a possession, and I put a mark of leprosy on a house in the land of your possession,
\v 35 then the one who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, 'Something like a mark of leprosy has become visible to Me in the house.'
\v 36 The priest shall then command that they empty the house before the priest goes in to look at the mark, so that everything in the house need not become unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to look at the house.
\v 37 So he shall look at the mark, and if the mark on the walls of the house has greenish or reddish depressions and appears deeper than the surface,
\v 38 then the priest shall come out of the house, to the doorway, and quarantine the house for seven days.
\v 39 The priest shall return on the seventh day and make an inspection. If the mark has indeed spread in the walls of the house,
\v 40 then the priest shall order them to tear out the stones with the mark in them and throw them away at an unclean place outside the city.
\v 41 He shall have the house scraped all around inside, and they shall dump the plaster that they scrape off at an unclean place outside the city.
\v 42 Then they shall take other stones and replace those stones, and he shall take other plaster and re-plaster the house.
\p
\v 43 "If, however, the mark breaks out again in the house after he has torn out the stones and scraped the house, and after it has been re-plastered,
\v 44 then the priest shall come in and make an inspection. If he sees that the mark has indeed spread in the house, it is a malignant mark in the house; it is unclean.
\v 45 He shall therefore tear down the house, its stones, and its timbers, and all the plaster of the house, and he shall take them outside the city to an unclean place.
\v 46 Moreover, whoever goes into the house during the time that he has quarantined it, becomes unclean until evening.
\v 47 Likewise, whoever lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
\p
\v 48 "If, on the other hand, the priest comes in and makes an inspection and the mark has not indeed spread in the house after the house has been re-plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the mark has not reappeared.
\v 49 To cleanse the house then, he shall take two birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop,
\v 50 and he shall slaughter the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
\v 51 Then he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet string, with the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird as well as in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
\v 52 He shall thus cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the running water, along with the live bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the scarlet string.
\v 53 However, he shall let the live bird go free outside the city into the open field. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it will be clean."
\p
\v 54 This is the Torah for any mark of leprosy-- even for a scale,
\v 55 and for the leprous garment or house,
\v 56 and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot--
\v 57 to teach when they are unclean and when they are clean. This is the Torah of leprosy.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 יהוה also spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and say to them, 'When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean.
\v 3 This, moreover, shall be his uncleanness in his discharge: it is his uncleanness whether his body allows its discharge to flow or whether his body obstructs its discharge.
\v 4 Every bed on which the person with the discharge lies becomes unclean, and everything on which he sits becomes unclean.
\v 5 Anyone, moreover, who touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening;
\v 6 and whoever sits on the thing on which the man with the discharge has been sitting, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
\p
\v 7 Also whoever touches the person with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
\v 8 Or if the man with the discharge spits on one who is clean, he too shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
\v 9 Every saddle on which the person with the discharge rides becomes unclean.
\v 10 Whoever then touches any of the things which were under him shall be unclean until evening, and he who carries them shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
\v 11 Likewise, whomever the one with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
\v 12 However, an earthenware vessel which the person with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water.
\p
\v 13 Now when the man with the discharge becomes cleansed from his discharge, then he shall count off for himself seven days for his cleansing; he shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water and will become clean.
\v 14 Then on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and come before יהוה to the doorway of the Tent of Appointment and give them to the priest;
\v 15 and the priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for an ascension offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before יהוה because of his discharge.
\p
\v 16 Now if a man has a seminal emission, he shall bathe all his body in water and be unclean until evening.
\v 17 As for any garment or any leather on which there is seminal emission, it shall be washed with water and be unclean until evening.
\v 18 If a man lies with a woman so that there is a seminal emission, they shall both bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
\p
\v 19 When a woman has a discharge, if her discharge in her body is blood, she shall continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening.
\v 20 Everything also on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean, and everything on which she sits shall be unclean.
\v 21 Anyone who touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
\v 22 Whoever touches any thing on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
\v 23 Whether it be on the bed or on the thing on which she is sitting, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until evening.
\v 24 If a man actually lies with her so that her menstrual impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.
\p
\v 25 Now if a woman has a discharge of her blood many days, not at the period of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond that period, all the days of her impure discharge she shall continue as though in her menstrual impurity; she is unclean.
\v 26 Any bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her like her bed at menstruation; and every thing on which she sits shall be unclean, like her uncleanness at that time.
\v 27 Likewise, whoever touches them shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
\v 28 When she becomes clean from her discharge, she shall count off for herself seven days; and afterward she will be clean.
\v 29 Then on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them in to the priest, to the doorway of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 30 The priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for an ascension offering. So the priest shall make atonement on her behalf before יהוה because of her impure discharge.'
\p
\v 31 "Thus you shall keep the children of Yisra'el separated from their uncleanness, so that they will not die in their uncleanness by their defiling My Tabernacle that is among them."
\v 32 This is the Torah for the one with a discharge, and for the man who has a seminal emission so that he is unclean by it,
\v 33 and for the woman who is sick because of menstrual impurity, and for the one who has a discharge, whether a male or a female, or a man who lies with an unclean woman.
\c 16
פרשת אחרי מות – Parashat Aḥarei Mot
\p
\v 1 Now יהוה spoke to Mosheh after the death of the two sons of Aharon, when they had approached the presence of יהוה and died.
\v 2 יהוה said to Mosheh: "Tell your brother Aharon that he shall not enter at any time into the set-apart place inside the veil, before the lid which is on the ark, or he will die; for I will appear in the cloud over the lid.
\v 3 Aharon shall enter the set-apart place with this: with a bull for a sin offering and a ram for an ascension offering.
\v 4 He shall put on the set-apart linen tunic, and the linen undergarments shall be next to his body, and he shall be girded with the linen sash and attired with the linen turban (these are set-apart garments). Then he shall bathe his body in water and put them on.
\p
\v 5 "He shall take from the congregation of the children of Yisra'el two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for an ascension offering.
\v 6 Then Aharon shall offer the bull for the sin offering which is for himself, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household.
\v 7 He shall take the two goats and present them before יהוה at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 8 Aharon shall cast lots for the two goats, one lot for יהוה and the other lot for azazel.
\v 9 Then Aharon shall offer the goat on which the lot for יהוה fell, and make it a sin offering.
\v 10 But the goat on which the lot for azazel fell shall be presented alive before יהוה, to make atonement upon it, to send it into the wilderness for azazel.
\p
\v 11 Then Aharon shall offer the bull of the sin offering which is for himself and make atonement for himself and for his household, and he shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself.
\v 12 He shall take a censer full of coals of fire from upon the altar before יהוה and two handfuls of finely ground sweet incense, and bring it inside the veil.
\v 13 He shall put the incense on the fire before יהוה, that the cloud of incense may cover the lid that is on the ark of the witness, otherwise he will die.
\v 14 Moreover, he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the lid on the east side; also in front of the lid he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
\p
\v 15 "Then he shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the people, and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the lid and in front of the lid.
\v 16 He shall make atonement for the set-apart place, because of the impurities of the children of Yisra'el and because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and thus he shall do for the Tent of Appointment which abides with them in the midst of their impurities.
\v 17 When he goes in to make atonement in the set-apart place, no one shall be in the Tent of Appointment until he comes out, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household and for all the assembly of Yisra'el.
\v 18 Then he shall go out to the altar that is before יהוה and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides.
\v 19 With his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times and cleanse it, and from the impurities of the children of Yisra'el set it apart.
\p
\v 20 "When he finishes atoning for the set-apart place and the Tent of Appointment and the altar, he shall offer the live goat.
\v 21 Then Aharon shall lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Yisra'el and all their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and he shall lay them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who stands in readiness.
\v 22 The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to a solitary land; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.
\p
\v 23 "Then Aharon shall come into the Tent of Appointment and take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the set-apart place, and shall leave them there.
\v 24 He shall bathe his body with water in a set-apart place and put on his clothes, and come forth and offer his ascension offering and the ascension offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people.
\v 25 Then he shall offer up in smoke the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
\v 26 The one who released the goat for azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; then afterward he shall come into the camp.
\v 27 But the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the set-apart place, shall be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn their hides, their flesh, and their refuse in the fire.
\v 28 Then the one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, then afterward he shall come into the camp.
\p
\v 29 "This shall be a permanent statute for you: in the seventh new moon, on the tenth day of the new moon, you shall humble your beings and not do any work, whether the native, or the sojourner who dwells among you;
\v 30 for it is on this day that atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you; you will be clean from all your sins before יהוה.
\v 31 It is to be a Sabbath of ceasing for you, that you may humble your beings; it is a permanent statute.
\v 32 So the priest who is anointed and ordained to serve as priest in his father's place shall make atonement: he shall thus put on the linen garments, the set-apart garments,
\v 33 and make atonement for the most set-apart place, and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Appointment and for the altar. He shall also make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
\v 34 Now you shall have this as a permanent statute, to make atonement for the children of Yisra'el for all their sins once every year." And just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh, so he did.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to Aharon and to his sons and to all the children of Yisra'el and say to them, 'This is what יהוה has commanded, saying,
\v 3 "Any man from the house of Yisra'el [or from the sojourners who dwell among you] who slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or who slaughters it outside the camp,
\v 4 and has not brought it to the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, [to make it an ascension offering or a peace offering to יהוה to be acceptable as a soothing aroma, but has slaughtered it outside and does not bring it to the doorway of the Tent of Appointment] to present it as an offering to יהוה before the Tabernacle of יהוה, blood is to be reckoned to that man. He has shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people.
\v 5 This is so that the children of Yisra'el may bring their sacrifices which they slaughter in the open field, that they may bring them in to יהוה, at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment to the priest, and slaughter them as sacrifices of peace offerings to יהוה.
\v 6 The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of יהוה at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, and offer up the fat in smoke as a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\v 7 They shall no longer slaughter their sacrifices to the goat demons with which they whore. This shall be a permanent statute to them throughout their generations."'
\p
\v 8 "Then you shall say to them, 'Any man from the house of Yisra'el, or from the sojourners who dwell among them, who offers an ascension offering or sacrifice,
\v 9 and does not bring it to the doorway of the Tent of Appointment to offer it to יהוה, that man also shall be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 10 And any man from the house of Yisra'el, or from the sojourners who dwell among them, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people.
\v 11 For the being of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your beings; for it is the blood by reason of the being that makes atonement.'
\p
\v 12 "Therefore I said to the children of Yisra'el, 'No person among you may eat blood, nor may any sojourner who dwells among you eat blood.'
\v 13 So when any man from the children of Yisra'el, or from the sojourners who dwells among them, in hunting catches a beast or a bird which may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.
\p
\v 14 "For as for the being of all flesh, its blood is for its being. Therefore I said to the children of Yisra'el, 'You are not to eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.'
\v 15 "When any person eats an animal which dies or is torn by beasts, whether he is a native or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening; then he will become clean.
\v 16 But if he does not wash them or bathe his body, then he shall bear his iniquity."
\c 18
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el and say to them, 'I am יהוה your Elohim.
\v 3 You shall not do what is done in the land of Mitsrayim where you lived, nor are you to do what is done in the land of Kena'an where I am bringing you; you shall not walk in their statutes.
\v 4 You are to perform My judgments and guard My statutes, to live in accord with them; I am יהוה your Elohim.
\v 5 So you shall guard My statutes and My judgments, by which a man may live if he does them; I am יהוה.
\p
\v 6 None of you shall approach any blood relative of his to uncover nakedness; I am יהוה.
\v 7 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, that is, the nakedness of your mother. She is your mother; you are not to uncover her nakedness.
\v 8 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife; it is your father's nakedness.
\v 9 The nakedness of your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether born at home or born outside, their nakedness you shall not uncover.
\v 10 The nakedness of your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for their nakedness is yours.
\v 11 The nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, born to your father, she is your sister, you shall not uncover her nakedness.
\v 12 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is your father's blood relative.
\v 13 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she is your mother's blood relative.
\v 14 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother; you shall not approach his wife, she is your aunt.
\v 15 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son's wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness.
\v 16 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife; it is your brother's nakedness.
\v 17 You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter, nor shall you take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are blood relatives. It is lewdness.
\v 18 You shall not marry a woman in addition to her sister as a rival while she is alive, to uncover her nakedness.
\p
\v 19 Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity.
\v 20 You shall not have relations with your neighbor's wife to give seed, to be defiled with her.
\v 21 You shall not give any of your seed to offer them to Molekh, nor shall you profane the Name of your Elohim; I am יהוה.
\v 22 You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.
\v 23 Also you shall not have relations with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion.
\p
\v 24 Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.
\v 25 For the land has become defiled, therefore I have brought its iniquity upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.
\v 26 But as for you, you are to guard My statutes and My judgments and shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor the sojourner who dwells among you
\v 27 (for the men of the land who have been before you have done all these abominations, and the land has become defiled);
\v 28 so that the land will not spew you out, should you defile it, as it has spewed out the nation which has been before you.
\v 29 For whoever does any of these abominations, they shall be cut off from among their people.
\v 30 Thus you are to guard My charge, that you do not practice any of the abominable customs which have been practiced before you, so as not to defile yourselves with them; I am יהוה your Elohim.'"

\c 19
\ms פרשת קדשים – Parashat Qedoshim
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying:
\p
\v 2 "Speak to all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el and say to them, 'You shall be set-apart, for I יהוה your Elohim am set-apart.
\v 3 Every one of you shall reverence his mother and his father, and you shall guard My Sabbaths; I am יהוה your Elohim.
\v 4 Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten elohim; I am יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 5 "Now when you slaughter a sacrifice of peace offerings to יהוה, you shall slaughter it so that you may be accepted.
\v 6 It shall be eaten the same day you slaughter it, and the next day; but what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire.
\v 7 So if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an offense; it will not be accepted.
\v 8 Everyone who eats it will bear his iniquity, for he has profaned the set-apart thing of יהוה; and that person shall be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 9 "Now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.
\v 10 Nor shall you glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the needy and for the sojourner. I am יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 11 "You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another.
\v 12 You shall not swear falsely by My Name, so as to profane the Name of your Elohim; I am יהוה.
\p
\v 13 "You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning.
\v 14 You shall not curse a deaf man, nor place a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall revere your Elohim; I am יהוה.
\p
\v 15 "You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor fairly.
\v 16 You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you are not to act against the life of your neighbor; I am יהוה.
\p
\v 17 "You shall not hate your fellow countryman in your heart; you may surely reprove your neighbor, but shall not incur sin because of him.
\v 18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am יהוה.
\p
\v 19 "You are to guard My statutes. You shall not breed together two kinds of your cattle; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, nor wear a garment upon you of two kinds of material mixed together.
\p
\v 20 "Now if a man lies with, and gives seed to a woman who is a slave acquired for another man, but who has in no way been redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be punishment; they shall not, however, be put to death, because she was not free.
\v 21 He shall bring his guilt offering to יהוה to the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, a ram for a guilt offering.
\v 22 The priest shall also make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before יהוה for his sin which he has committed, and the sin which he has committed will be forgiven him.
\p
\v 23 "When you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden. Three years it shall be forbidden to you; it shall not be eaten.
\v 24 But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be set-apart, an offering of celebration to יהוה.
\v 25 In the fifth year you are to eat of its fruit, that its yield may increase for you; I am יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 26 "You shall not eat anything with the blood, nor practice divination or soothsaying.
\v 27 You shall not round off the corners of your heads nor ruin the edges of your beard.
\v 28 You shall not make any cuts in your body for a being, nor make any tattoo marks on yourselves: I am יהוה.
\p
\v 29 Do not profane your daughter by making her a whore, so that the land will not fall to whoring and the land become full of lewdness.
\v 30 You shall guard My Sabbaths and fear My set-apart place; I am יהוה.
\p
\v 31 Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 32 You shall rise up before the gray-headed and honor the aged, and you shall fear your Elohim; I am יהוה.
\p
\v 33 When a sojourner resides with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.
\v 34 The sojourner who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were sojourners in the land of Mitsrayim; I am יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 35 You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measurement of weight, or capacity.
\v 36 You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin; I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out from the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 37 You shall thus guard all My statutes and all My judgments and do them; I am יהוה.'"
\c 20
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "You shall say to the children of Yisra'el: 'Any man from the children of Yisra'el or from the sojourners dwelling in Yisra'el who gives any of his seed to Molekh, shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
\v 3 I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given some of his seed to Molekh, so as to defile My set-apart place and to profane My set-apart Name.
\v 4 If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when he gives any of his seed to Molekh, so as not to put him to death,
\v 5 then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family, and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who whore after him, by whoring after Molekh.
\p
\v 6 As for the being who turns to mediums and to spiritists, to whore after them, I will also set My face against that being and will cut him off from among his people.
\v 7 You shall set yourselves apart therefore and be set-apart, for I am יהוה your Elohim.
\v 8 You shall guard My statutes and practice them; I am יהוה who sets you apart.
\p
\v 9 For everyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother, his blood is upon him.
\p
\v 10 If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, if a man commits adultery with another man's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
\v 11 If a man lies with his father's wife, he has uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death, their blood is upon them.
\v 12 If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death; they have committed perversion, their blood is upon them.
\v 13 If a man lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death. Their blood is upon them.
\v 14 If a man marries a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; both he and they shall be burned with fire, so that there will be no lewdness in your midst.
\v 15 If a man has relations with an animal, he shall surely be put to death; you shall also kill the animal.
\v 16 If a woman approaches any animal to mate with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall surely be put to death. Their blood is upon them.
\p
\v 17 If a man takes his sister, his father's daughter or his mother's daughter, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people. He has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he bears his iniquity.
\v 18 If a man lies with a sick woman and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood; thus both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
\v 19 You shall also not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister or of your father's sister, for such a one has made naked his blood relative; they will bear their iniquity.
\v 20 If a man lies with his uncle's wife he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness; they will bear their sin. They will die childless.
\v 21 If a man takes his brother's wife, it is impure; he has uncovered his brother's nakedness. They will be childless.
\p
\v 22 You are therefore to guard all My statutes and all My judgments and do them, so that the land to which I am bringing you to live will not spew you out.
\v 23 Moreover, you shall not follow the statutes of the nation which I will drive out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have abhorred them.
\v 24 Hence I have said to you, "You are to possess their land, and I Myself will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey." I am יהוה your Elohim, who has separated you from the peoples.
\v 25 You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; and you shall not make yourselves detestable by animal or by bird or by anything that creeps on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean.
\v 26 Thus you are to be set-apart to Me, for I יהוה am set-apart; and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine.
\p
\v 27 Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones, their blood is upon them.'"
\p
\c 21
\ms פרשת אמר – Parashat Emor
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aharon, and say to them that none of them shall become defiled for a being among his people,
\v 2 except for his nearest of kin, his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, his brother,
\v 3 or his virgin sister (who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may defile himself).
\v 4 He shall not defile himself as an owner among his people and so profane himself.
\v 5 They shall not make baldness upon their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
\v 6 They shall be set-apart to their Elohim, and not profane the Name of their Elohim; for they offer the offerings by fire to יהוה, the bread of their Elohim; therefore they shall be set-apart.
\v 7 They shall not marry a whore or a woman who has been defiled; neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband; for the priest is set-apart to his Elohim.
\v 8 You shall set him apart, for he offers the bread of your Elohim; he shall be set-apart to you; for I יהוה, who sets you apart, am set-apart.
\p
\v 9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by whoring, profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire.
\v 10 The priest who is great among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and who has been set apart to wear the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose, nor rend his clothes;
\v 11 he shall not go near to any dead being, nor defile himself, even for his father or for his mother;
\v 12 neither shall he go out of the set-apart place, nor profane the set-apart place of his Elohim; for the setting apart of the anointing oil of his Elohim is upon him: I am יהוה.
\v 13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
\v 14 A widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled, or a whore, these he shall not marry; but he shall take to wife a virgin of his own people,
\v 15 that he may not profane his seed among his people; for I am יהוה who sets him apart."
\p
\v 16 And יהוה said to Mosheh,
\v 17 "Say to Aharon, 'None of your seed throughout their generations who has a blemish may approach to offer the bread of his Elohim.
\v 18 For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, a man blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long,
\v 19 or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand,
\v 20 or a hunchback, or a dwarf, or a man with a defect in his eyes or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles;
\v 21 no man of the seed of Aharon the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer to יהוה any offerings by fire; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his Elohim.
\v 22 He may eat the bread of his Elohim, both of the most set-apart and of the set-apart things,
\v 23 but he shall not come near the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not profane My set-apart places; for I am יהוה who sets them apart.'"
\v 24 So Mosheh spoke to Aharon and to his sons and to all the children of Yisra'el.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Mosheh,
\v 2 "Tell Aharon and his sons to keep away from the set-apart things of the children of Yisra'el, which they dedicate to me, so that they may not profane My set-apart Name; I am יהוה.
\v 3 Say to them, 'If any one of all your seed throughout your generations approaches the set-apart things, which the children of Yisra'el dedicate to יהוה, while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from My presence: I am יהוה.
\v 4 None of the seed of Aharon who is a leper or suffers a discharge may eat of the set-apart things until he is clean. Whoever touches any unclean being or a man who has had an emission of semen,
\v 5 and whoever touches an [unclean] creeping thing by which he may be made unclean or a man from whom he may take uncleanness, whatever his uncleanness may be—
\v 6 the being who touches any such thing shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the set-apart things unless he has bathed his body in water.
\v 7 When the sun is down he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the set-apart things, because such are his food.
\v 8 That which dies of itself or is torn by beasts he shall not eat, defiling himself by it: I am יהוה.'
\v 9 They shall therefore guard My charge, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it: I am יהוה who sets them apart.
\p
\v 10 "A stranger shall not eat of a set-apart thing. A guest of the priest's or a hired servant shall not eat of a set-apart thing;
\v 11 but if a priest buys a slave as his property for money, the slave may eat of it; and those that are born in his house may eat of his food.
\v 12 If a priest's daughter is married to a stranger she shall not eat of the offering of the set-apart things.
\v 13 But if a priest's daughter is a widow or divorced, and has no seed, and returns to her father's house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; yet no stranger shall eat of it.
\v 14 And if a man eats of a set-apart thing unknowingly, he shall add the fifth of its value to it, and give the set-apart thing to the priest.
\v 15 The priests shall not profane the set-apart things of the children of Yisra'el, which they offer to יהוה,
\v 16 and so cause them to bear the iniquity of guilt, by eating their set-apart things: for I am יהוה who sets them apart."
\p
\v 17 And יהוה said to Mosheh,
\v 18 "Say to Aharon and his sons and all the children of Yisra'el, 'When any one of the house of Yisra'el or of the sojourners in Yisra'el presents his offering, whether in payment of a vow or as a freewill offering which is offered to יהוה as an ascension offering,
\v 19 to be accepted you shall offer a male without blemish, of the bulls or the sheep or the goats.
\v 20 You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable for you.
\v 21 And when any one offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to יהוה, to fulfil a vow or as a freewill offering, from the herd or from the flock, to be accepted it must be perfect; there shall be no blemish in it.
\v 22 Animals blind or disabled or mutilated or having a discharge or an itch or scabs, you shall not offer to יהוה or make of them an offering by fire upon the altar to יהוה.
\v 23 A bull or a lamb which has a part too long or too short you may present for a freewill offering; but for a vow it cannot be accepted.
\v 24 Any animal which has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you shall not make as an offering to יהוה within your land;
\v 25 neither shall you offer as the bread of your Elohim any such animals gotten from a foreigner. Since there is a blemish in them, because of their mutilation, they will not be accepted for you.'"
\p
\v 26 And יהוה said to Mosheh,
\v 27 "When a bull or sheep or goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as an offering by fire to יהוה.
\v 28 And whether the mother is a cow or a ewe, you shall not kill both her and her young in one day.
\v 29 And when you slaughter a sacrifice of thanksgiving to יהוה, you shall slaughter it so that you may be accepted.
\v 30 It shall be eaten on the same day, you shall leave none of it until morning: I am יהוה.
\v 31 So you shall guard My commands and do them: I am יהוה.
\v 32 And you shall not profane My set-apart Name, but I will be set apart among the children of Yisra'el; I am יהוה who sets you apart,
\v 33 who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim to be your Elohim: I am יהוה."
\c 23
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them, 'The appointed times of יהוה, which you shall proclaim to be set-apart rehearsals; even these are My appointed times.
\p
\v 3 Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of ceasing, a set-apart rehearsal; you shall do no kind of work. It is a Sabbath to יהוה in all your dwellings.
\p
\v 4 These are the appointed times of יהוה, even set-apart rehearsals, which you shall proclaim in their appointed time.
\v 5 In the first new moon, on the fourteenth day of the new moon between the evenings, is the Pesaḥ of יהוה.
\v 6 On the fifteenth day of the same new moon is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to יהוה. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
\v 7 On the first day you shall have a set-apart rehearsal. You shall do no work of service.
\v 8 But you shall offer an offering made by fire to יהוה seven days. In the seventh day is a set-apart rehearsal: you shall do no work of service.'"
\p
\v 9 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 10 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them, 'When you have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:
\v 11 and he shall wave the sheaf before יהוה, to be accepted for you. On the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
\v 12 On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb without blemish a year old for an ascension offering to יהוה.
\v 13 The meal offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to יהוה for a soothing aroma; and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
\v 14 You shall eat neither bread, nor roasted grain, nor fresh grain, until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your Elohim. This is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\p
\v 15 You shall count from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Sabbaths shall be completed:
\v 16 even to the morrow after the seventh Sabbath you shall number fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal offering to יהוה.
\v 17 You shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a wave offering, [two cakes] made of two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour. They shall be baked with leaven, for first fruits to יהוה.
\v 18 You shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, one young bull, and two rams [without blemish]. They shall be an ascension offering to יהוה, with their meal offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, for a soothing aroma to יהוה.
\v 19 You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
\v 20 The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before יהוה, with the two lambs. They shall be set-apart to יהוה for the priest.
\v 21 You shall make proclamation on the same day: there shall be a set-apart rehearsal to you; you shall do no work of service. This is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
\p
\v 22 When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap into the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest: you shall leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner. I am יהוה your Elohim.'"
\p
\v 23 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 24 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying, 'In the seventh new moon, on the first day of the new moon, shall be a ceasing of labor to you, a Memorial of Soundings, a set-apart rehearsal.
\v 25 You shall do no work of service; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to יהוה.'"
\p
\v 26 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 27 "However on the tenth day of this seventh new moon is the Day of Atonement: it shall be a set-apart rehearsal to you, and you shall afflict your beings; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to יהוה.
\v 28 You shall do no kind of work in that same day; for it is a Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before יהוה your Elohim.
\v 29 For whoever it is who shall not afflict himself in that same day; shall be cut off from his people.
\v 30 Whoever it is who does any kind of work in that same day, that person I will destroy from among his people.
\v 31 You shall do no kind of work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\v 32 It shall be a Sabbath of ceasing for you, and you shall afflict your beings, from the ninth day of the new moon at evening, from evening to evening, you shall cease in your Sabbath."
\p
\v 33 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 34 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and say, 'On the fifteenth day of this seventh new moon is the Feast of Sukkot for seven days to יהוה.
\v 35 On the first day shall be a set-apart rehearsal: you shall do no work of service.
\v 36 Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to יהוה. On the Eighth Day shall be a set-apart rehearsal to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to יהוה. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no work of service.
\p
\v 37 These are the appointed times of יהוה, which you shall proclaim to be set-apart rehearsals, to offer an offering made by fire to יהוה, an ascension offering, and a meal offering, a slaughtering, and drink offerings, each on its own day;
\v 38 besides the Sabbaths of יהוה, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings, which you give to יהוה.
\p
\v 39 So on the fifteenth day of the seventh new moon, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast of יהוה seven days: on the first day shall be a ceasing from labor, and on the eighth day shall be a ceasing from labor.
\v 40 On the first day, you shall take the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the wadi; and you shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim seven days.
\v 41 You shall keep it a feast to יהוה seven days in the year: it is a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall keep it in the seventh new moon.
\v 42 You shall dwell in sukkot for seven days. All who are native-born in Yisra'el shall dwell in booths,
\v 43 that your generations may know that I made the children of Yisra'el to dwell in sukkot, when I brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim. I am יהוה your Elohim.'"
\v 44 Mosheh declared to the children of Yisra'el the appointed times of יהוה.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Command the children of Yisra'el, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
\v 3 Outside of the veil of the witness, in the Tent of Appointment, shall Aharon keep it in order from evening to morning before יהוה continually: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
\v 4 He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold menorah before יהוה continually.
\p
\v 5 "You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.
\v 6 You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before יהוה.
\v 7 You shall put pure frankincense on each row that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to יהוה.
\v 8 Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before יהוה continually. It is on the behalf of the children of Yisra'el an everlasting covenant.
\v 9 It shall be for Aharon and his sons; and they shall eat it in a set-apart place: for it is most set-apart to him of the offerings of יהוה made by fire by a perpetual statute."
\p
\v 10 The son of a Yisra'elite woman, whose father was a Mitsrite, went out among the children of Yisra'el; and the son of the Yisra'elite woman and a man of Yisra'el strove together in the camp.
\v 11 The son of the Yisra'elite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Mosheh. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Divri, of the tribe of Dan.
\v 12 They put him in custody, until the will of יהוה should be declared to them.
\p
\v 13 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 14 "Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
\v 15 You shall speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying, 'Whoever curses his Elohim shall bear his sin.
\v 16 He who blasphemes the Name of יהוה, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: the sojourner as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
\p
\v 17 He who strikes any being of a man mortally shall surely be put to death.
\v 18 He who strikes any being of an animal mortally shall make it good, being for being.
\v 19 If anyone injures his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him:
\v 20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to him.
\v 21 He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.
\v 22 You shall have one kind of judgment, for the sojourner as well as the native-born: for I am יהוה your Elohim.'"
\v 23 Mosheh spoke to the children of Yisra'el; and they brought forth him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Yisra'el did as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\c 25
פרשת בהר – Parashat Behar
\p
\v 1 יהוה said to Mosheh on Mount Sinai,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them, 'When you come into the land which I give you, then the land shall cease in a Sabbath to יהוה.
\v 3 Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in its fruits;
\v 4 but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of ceasing for the land, a Sabbath to יהוה. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
\v 5 What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your separated vine you shall not gather. It shall be a year of ceasing for the land.
\v 6 The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant, and for your guest who sojourns with you.
\v 7 For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for food.
\p
\v 8 You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.
\v 9 Then you shall sound the loud shofar on the tenth day of the seventh new moon. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the shofar throughout all your land.
\v 10 You shall make the fiftieth year set-apart, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a yovel to you; and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family.
\v 11 That fiftieth year shall be a yovel to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself, nor gather from the separated vines.
\v 12 For it is a yovel; it shall be set-apart to you. You shall eat of its increase out of the field.
\p
\v 13 In this Year of Yovel each of you shall return to his property.
\v 14 If you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another.
\v 15 According to the number of years after the yovel you shall buy from your neighbor. According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you.
\v 16 According to the length of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the shortness of the years you shall diminish its price; for he is selling the number of the crops to you.
\v 17 You shall not wrong one another; but you shall fear your Elohim: for I am יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 18 Therefore you shall do My statutes, and guard My judgments and do them; and you shall dwell in the land securely.
\v 19 The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell in it securely.
\v 20 If you said, "What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;"
\v 21 then I will command My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.
\v 22 You shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, you shall eat the old store.
\p
\v 23 The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is Mine; for you are sojourners and live as guests with Me.
\v 24 In all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.
\p
\v 25 If your brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possessions, then his redeemer who is near to him shall come, and redeem that which his brother has sold.
\v 26 If a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it;
\v 27 then let him reckon the years since its sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return to his property.
\v 28 But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the Year of Yovel: and in the yovel it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.
\p
\v 29 If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.
\v 30 If it is not redeemed within the span of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not be released in the yovel.
\v 31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the yovel.
\p
\v 32 Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.
\v 33 The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released in the yovel; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Yisra'el.
\v 34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
\p
\v 35 If your brother has become poor, and his hand cannot support him among you; then you shall uphold him. He shall live with you like a sojourner and a guest.
\v 36 Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your Elohim; that your brother may live among you.
\v 37 You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.
\v 38 I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you forth out of the land of Mitsrayim, to give you the land of Kena'an, and to be your Elohim.
\p
\v 39 If your brother has grown poor among you, and sells himself to you; you shall not make him to serve as a slave.
\v 40 As a hired servant, and as a guest, he shall be with you; he shall serve with you until the Year of Yovel:
\v 41 then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers.
\v 42 For they are My servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Mitsrayim. They shall not be sold as slaves.
\v 43 You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall fear your Elohim.
\v 44 As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have; of the nations that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves.
\v 45 Moreover of the children of the guests who sojourn among you, of them you may buy, and of their families who are with you, which they have conceived in your land; and they will be your property.
\v 46 You may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them may you take your slaves forever: but over your brothers the children of Yisra'el you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness.
\p
\v 47 If a sojourner or guest with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself to the sojourner or guest living among you, or to a member of the sojourner's family;
\v 48 after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him;
\v 49 or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.
\v 50 He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Yovel: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.
\v 51 If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
\v 52 If there remain but a few years to the year of yovel, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.
\v 53 As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with harshness over him in your eyes.
\v 54 If he is not redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Yovel, he, and his children with him.
\v 55 For to Me the children of Yisra'el are servants; they are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Mitsrayim. I am יהוה your Elohim.

\v 1 "'You shall make for yourselves no idols, neither shall you raise up an engraved image or a pillar, neither shall you place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am יהוה your Elohim.
\v 2 You shall guard My Sabbaths, and have reverence for My set-apart place. I am יהוה.
\p
\ms פרשת בחקתי – Parashat Beḥuqotai
\v 3 If you walk in My statutes, and guard My commands, and do them;
\v 4 then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
\v 5 Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land securely.
\v 6 I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one will make you afraid; and I will cause evil animals to cease from the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
\v 7 You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
\v 8 Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
\v 9 I will have respect for you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish My covenant with you.
\v 10 You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall move out the old because of the new.
\v 11 I will set My Tabernacle among you: and My being will not abhor you.
\v 12 I will walk among you, and will be your Elohim, and you will be My people.
\v 13 I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you forth out of the land of Mitsrayim, that you should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.
\p
\v 14 But if you will not listen to Me, and will not do all these commands;
\v 15 and if you shall reject My statutes, and if your being abhors My judgments, so that you will not do all My commands, but break My covenant;
\v 16 I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the being to pine away; and you will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it.
\v 17 I will set My face against you, and you will be struck before your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you; and you will flee when no one pursues you.
\v 18 If you in spite of these things will not listen to Me, then I will discipline you seven times more for your sins.
\v 19 I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your heavens like iron, and your soil like copper;
\v 20 and your strength will be spent in vain; for your land will not yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit.
\p
\v 21 If you walk contrary to Me, and will not listen to Me, then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.
\v 22 I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, cut off your livestock, and make you few in number; and your roads will become desolate.
\p
\v 23 If by these things you will not be reformed to Me, but will walk contrary to Me;
\v 24 then I will also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins.
\v 25 I will bring a sword upon you, that will execute the vengeance of the covenant; and you will be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
\v 26 When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.
\p
\v 27 If you in spite of this will not listen to Me, but walk contrary to Me;
\v 28 then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I also will discipline you seven times for your sins.
\v 29 You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.
\v 30 I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-pillars, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and My being will abhor you.
\v 31 I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your set-apart places to desolation, and I will not smell your soothing aromas.
\v 32 I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell in it will be astonished at it.
\v 33 I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land will be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
\p
\v 34 Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies' land. Even then the land will cease and enjoy its Sabbaths.
\v 35 As long as it lies desolate it shall cease, even the ceasing of labor which it did not have in your Sabbaths, when you lived on it.
\v 36 As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they will fall when no one pursues.
\v 37 They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues: and you will have no power to stand before your enemies.
\v 38 You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will eat you up.
\v 39 Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
\p
\v 40 If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against Me, and also that, because they walked contrary to Me,
\v 41 I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then make amends for their iniquity;
\v 42 then I will remember My covenant with Ya'aqov; and also My covenant with Yitsḥaq, and also My covenant with Avraham; and I will remember the land.
\v 43 The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them: and they will make amends for their iniquity; because, even because they rejected My judgments, and their being abhorred My statutes.
\v 44 Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am יהוה their Elohim;
\v 45 but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Mitsrayim in the sight of the nations, that I might be their Elohim. I am יהוה.'"
\p
\v 46 These are the statutes, and the judgments, and the Torot, which יהוה made between Him and the children of Yisra'el in Mount Sinai by Mosheh.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and say to them, 'When a man makes a vow, the persons shall be for יהוה by your valuation.
\v 3 Your valuation shall be of a male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your valuation shall be fifty sheqels of silver, after the sheqel of the set-apart place.
\v 4 If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty sheqels.
\v 5 If the person is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty sheqels, and for a female ten sheqels.
\v 6 If the person is from a new moon old even to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five sheqels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three sheqels of silver.
\v 7 If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen sheqels, and for a female ten sheqels.
\v 8 But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.
\p
\v 9 If it is an animal, of which men offer an offering to יהוה, all that any man gives of such to יהוה becomes set-apart.
\v 10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be set-apart.
\v 11 If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to יהוה, then he shall set the animal before the priest;
\v 12 and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest values it, so shall it be.
\v 13 But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.
\p
\v 14 When a man dedicates his house to be set-apart to יהוה, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand.
\v 15 If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.
\p
\v 16 If a man dedicates to יהוה part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it: the sowing of an omer of barley shall be valued at fifty sheqels of silver.
\v 17 If he dedicates his field from the Year of Yovel, according to your valuation it shall stand.
\v 18 But if he dedicates his field after the Yovel, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Yovel; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation.
\v 19 If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his.
\v 20 If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;
\v 21 but the field, when it goes out in the Yovel, shall be set-apart to יהוה, as a field devoted; it shall be owned by the priests.
\v 22 If he dedicates to יהוה a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,
\v 23 then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Yovel; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a set-apart thing to יהוה.
\v 24 In the Year of Yovel the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.
\v 25 All your valuations shall be according to the sheqel of the set-apart place: twenty gerahs to the sheqel.
\p
\v 26 Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn to יהוה, no man may dedicate it; whether an ox or sheep, it belongs to יהוה.
\v 27 If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it: or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
\p
\v 28 Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man shall devote to יהוה of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most set-apart to יהוה.
\v 29 No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 30 All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, belongs to יהוה. It is set-apart to יהוה.
\v 31 If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it.
\v 32 All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be set-apart to יהוה.
\v 33 He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be set-apart. It shall not be redeemed.'"
\p
\v 34 These are the commands which יהוה commanded Mosheh for the children of Yisra'el on Mount Sinai.
