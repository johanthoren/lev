\p
\v 1 Now these are the names of the sons of Yisra'el who came to Mitsrayim with Ya'aqov; they came each one with his household:
\v 2 Reuven, Shimon, Levi and Yehudah;
\v 3 Yissakhar, Zevulun and Benyamin;\f + \fr 1:3 \ft DSS add, "and Yoseph" here.\f*
\v 4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
\v 5 All the persons who came from the loins of Ya'aqov were seventy\f + \fr 1:5 \ft DSS and LXX both read "seventy-five" instead of "seventy" here.\f* beings, [but Yoseph was already in Mitsrayim].\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading not present in the DSS.\f*
\v 6 Yoseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.
\v 7 But the sons of Yisra'el were fruitful and increased greatly, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty, so that the land was filled with them.
\p
\v 8 Now a new king arose over Mitsrayim, who did not know Yoseph.
\v 9 He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children of Yisra'el are more and mightier than we.
\v 10 Come, let us deal wisely with them, or else they will multiply and in the event of war, they will also join themselves to those who hate us, and fight against us and depart from the land."
\v 11 So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with hard labor. And they built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Ra'amses.
\v 12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out, so that they were in dread of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 13 The Mitsrites compelled the children of Yisra'el to serve rigorously;
\v 14 and they made their lives bitter with harsh service in mortar and bricks and all \add kinds\add* of service in the field, all their serving which they rigorously imposed on them.\f + \fr 1:14 \ft DSS add, "They continued to multiply and increase greatly, and Mitsrayim was in dread because of the children of Yisra'el" here.\f*
\p
\v 15 And the king of Mitsrayim spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other was named Puah;
\v 16 and he said, "When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see \add them\add* upon the birthstool, if it is a son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live."
\v 17 But the midwives feared Elohim, and did not do as the king of Mitsrayim had commanded them, but let the boys live.
\v 18 So the king of Mitsrayim called for the midwives\f + \fr 1:18 \ft DSS read, "Hebrew midwives" instead here.\f* and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and let the boys live?"
\v 19 The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not as the Mitsrite women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them."
\v 20 So Elohim was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.
\v 21 Because the midwives feared Elohim, He established households for them.
\v 22 And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son who is born you are to cast into the Nile, and every daughter you are to keep alive."
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi.
\v 2 The woman conceived and brought forth a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three new moons.
\v 3 But when she could hide him no longer, she got him a wicker basket\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Hebrew word for "basket" is תבה (tevah), the same word used in Bereshiyt 6:14 for "ark."\f* and covered it over with tar and pitch. And she put the child into it and set \add it\add* among the reeds by the bank of the Nile.
\v 4 His sister stood at a distance to find out what would happen to him.
\p
\v 5 The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, with her maidens walking alongside the Nile; and she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid, and she brought it \add to her\add*.
\v 6 When she opened \add it\add*, she saw the child, and behold, \add the\add* boy was crying. And she had pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
\v 7 And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for you?"
\v 8 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go." So the maiden went and called the child's mother.
\v 9 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me and I will give \add you\add* your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.
\v 10 The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. And she named him Mosheh, and said, "Because I drew him out of the water."
\p
\v 11 Now it came about in those days, when Mosheh had grown up, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors; and he saw a Mitsrite beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
\v 12 So he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no one \add around\add*, he struck down the Mitsrite and hid him in the sand.
\v 13 He went out the next day, and behold, two Hebrews were fighting with each other; and he said to the wicked, "Why are you striking your companion?"
\v 14 But he said, "Who made you a prince or a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Mitsrite?" And Mosheh was afraid and said, "Surely the matter has become known."
\p
\v 15 When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried to kill Mosheh. But Mosheh fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
\p
\v 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters [shepherding his flock];\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading present in the DSS and the LXX but absent from the Heb. MT.\f* and they came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
\v 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Mosheh stood up and helped them and watered their flock.
\v 18 When they came to Reu'el their father, he said, "Why have you come \add back\add* so soon today?"
\v 19 So they said, "A Mitsrite delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and what is more, he even drew the water for us and watered the flock."
\v 20 He said to his daughters, "Where is he then? Why is it that you have left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat."
\v 21 Mosheh was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Tsipporah to Mosheh.
\v 22 And she brought forth a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
\p
\v 23 Now it came about in those many days that the king of Mitsrayim died. And the children of Yisra'el sighed because of the service, and they cried out; and their cry for help because \add their\add* service rose up to Elohim.
\v 24 So Elohim heard their groaning; and Elohim remembered His covenant with Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya'aqov.
\v 25 Elohim saw the children of Yisra'el, and Elohim took notice \add of them\add*.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now Mosheh was pasturing the flock of Yithro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Ḥorev, the mountain of Elohim.
\v 2 The messenger of יהוה appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, yet the bush was not consumed.
\v 3 So Mosheh said, "I must turn aside now and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up."
\v 4 When יהוה saw that he turned aside to look, Elohim called to him from the midst of the bush and said, "Mosheh, Mosheh!" And he said, "Here I am."
\v 5 And He said, "Do not come near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is set-apart ground."
\v 6 He said also, "I am the Elohim of your father, the Elohim of Avraham, the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya'aqov." And Mosheh hid his face, for he was afraid to look at Elohim.
\p
\v 7 יהוה said, "I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Mitsrayim, and have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.
\v 8 So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Mitsrites, and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Kena'anite and the Ḥittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Ḥivite and the Yevusite.
\v 9 Now, behold, the cry of the children of Yisra'el has come to Me; furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Mitsrites are oppressing them.
\p
\v 10 "Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the children of Yisra'el, out of Mitsrayim."
\v 11 But Mosheh said to Elohim, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Yisra'el out of Mitsrayim?"
\v 12 And He said, "Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Mitsrayim, you shall serve Elohim at this mountain."
\p
\v 13 And Mosheh said to Elohim, "Behold, I am going to the children of Yisra'el, and I will say to them, 'The Elohim of your fathers has sent me to you.' Now they may say to me, 'What is His Name?' What shall I say to them?"
\v 14 Elohim said to Mosheh, "I AM THAT I AM;" and He said, "Thus you shall say to the children of Yisra'el, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
\p
\v 15 Elohim, furthermore, said to Mosheh, "Thus you shall say to the children of Yisra'el, 'יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Avraham, the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya'aqov, has sent me to you.' This is My Name forever, and this is My memorial-name to all generations.
\v 16 Go and gather the elders of [the children of]\f + \fr 3:16 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading present in the DSS and the LXX but absent from the Heb. MT.\f* Yisra'el together and say to them, 'יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Avraham, [the Elohim of] Yitsḥaq and [the Elohim of] Ya'aqov, has appeared to me, saying, "I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Mitsrayim.
\v 17 So I said, 'I will bring you up out of the affliction of Mitsrayim to the land of the Kena'anite and the Ḥittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Ḥivite and the Yevusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.'"
\v 18 They will pay heed to what you say; and you with the elders of Yisra'el will come to the king of Mitsrayim and you will say to him, 'יהוה, the Elohim of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may slaughter to יהוה our Elohim.'
\v 19 But I know that the king of Mitsrayim will not permit you to go, except under a mighty hand.
\v 20 So I will stretch out My hand and strike Mitsrayim with all My miracles which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go.
\v 21 I will grant this people favor in the sight of the Mitsrites; and it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty-handed.
\v 22 But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you will put them on your sons and daughters. Thus you will plunder the Mitsrites."
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And Mosheh said, "What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say? For they may say, 'יהוה has not appeared to you.'"
\v 2 יהוה said to him, "What is that in your hand?" And he said, "A staff."
\v 3 And He said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it became a naḥash; and Mosheh fled from it.
\v 4 But יהוה said to Mosheh, "Stretch out your hand and grasp \add it\add* by its tail"-- so he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand—
\v 5 "that they may believe because יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, the Elohim of Avraham, the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya'aqov, has appeared to you."
\p
\v 6 יהוה furthermore said to him, "Now put your hand into your bosom." So he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.
\v 7 And He said, "Put your hand into your bosom again." So he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was restored like \add the rest of\add* his flesh.
\v 8 If they will not believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe the voice of the last sign.
\v 9 But if they will not believe even to these two signs or heed what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground."
\p
\v 10 And Mosheh said to יהוה, "Please, יהוה, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am heavy of speech and heavy of tongue."
\v 11 יהוה said to him, "Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes \add him\add* mute or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, יהוה?
\v 12 Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and teach you what you are to say."
\v 13 But he said, "Please, יהוה, now send \add the message\add* by whomever You will."
\p
\v 14 And the anger of יהוה burned against Mosheh, and He said, "Is there not your brother Aharon the Levite? I know that he speaks \add with good\add* speech. And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
\v 15 You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I, even I, will be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do.
\v 16 Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; and he will be as a mouth for you and you will be as Elohim to him.
\v 17 You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs."
\p
\v 18 And Mosheh departed and returned to Yithro his father-in-law and said to him, "Please, let me go, that I may return to my brethren who are in Mitsrayim, and see if they are still alive." And Yithro said to Mosheh, "Go in peace."
\v 19 Now יהוה said to Mosheh in Midian, "Go back to Mitsrayim, for all the men who were seeking your being are dead."
\v 20 So Mosheh took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Mitsrayim. Mosheh also took the staff of Elohim in his hand.
\p
\v 21 יהוה said to Mosheh, "When you go back to Mitsrayim see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
\v 22 And you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says יהוה, "Yisra'el is My son, My firstborn.
\v 23 So I said to you, 'Let My son go that he may serve Me'; but you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn."'"
\p
\v 24 Now it came about at the lodging place on the way, that יהוה\f + \fr 4:24 \ft LXX reads, "a messenger of יהוה."\f* met him and sought to put him to death.
\v 25 And Tsipporah took a flint \add knife\add* and cut off her son's foreskin and threw it at Mosheh's feet, and she said, "You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me."\f + \fr 4:25 \ft yr. reads, "Then Tsipporah took a flint knife, and fell down at the feet of יהוה and said, 'I have a bloody husband.'" LXX reads, "and Tsipporah, having taken a stone, cut off the foreskin of her son, and fell at His feet and said, 'The blood of the circumcision of my son is staunched.'"\f*
\v 26 So He let him alone. At that time she said, "\add You are\add* a bridegroom of blood"-- because of the circumcision.
\p
\v 27 Now יהוה said to Aharon, "Go to meet Mosheh in the wilderness." So he went and met him at the mountain of Elohim and kissed him.
\v 28 Mosheh told Aharon all the words of יהוה with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him \add to do\add*.
\v 29 And Mosheh and Aharon went and assembled all the elders of the children of Yisra'el;
\v 30 and Aharon spoke all the words which יהוה had spoken to Mosheh. He then performed the signs in the sight of the people.
\v 31 So the people believed; and when they heard that יהוה was concerned about the children of Yisra'el and that He had seen their affliction, then they stooped low and bowed down.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 And afterward Mosheh and Aharon came and said to Pharaoh, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'Let My people go that they may celebrate a Feast to Me in the wilderness.'"
\v 2 But Pharaoh said, "Who is יהוה that I should obey His voice to let Yisra'el go? I do not know יהוה, and besides, I will not let Yisra'el go."
\v 3 And they said, "The Elohim of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may slaughter to יהוה our Elohim, otherwise He will fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."
\v 4 But the king of Mitsrayim said to them, "Mosheh and Aharon, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get \add back\add* to your labors!"
\v 5 Again Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!"
\v 6 So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying,
\v 7 "You are no longer to give the people straw to make brick as previously; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 But the quota of bricks which they were making previously, you shall impose on them; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, therefore they cry out, 'Let us go and slaughter to our Elohim.'
\v 9 Let the service be heavier on the men, and let them work at it so that they will pay no attention to false words."
\p
\v 10 So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I am not going to give you straw.
\v 11 You go get straw for yourselves wherever you can find, but none of your service will be reduced.'"
\v 12 So the people scattered through all the land of Mitsrayim to gather stubble for straw.
\v 13 The taskmasters pressed them, saying, "Complete your work quota, \add your\add* daily amount, just as when you had straw."
\v 14 Moreover, the foremen of the children of Yisra'el, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, "Why have you not completed your required amount either yesterday or today in making brick as previously?"
\p
\v 15 And the foremen of the children of Yisra'el came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?
\v 16 There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your people."
\v 17 But he said, "You are lazy, lazy; therefore you say, 'Let us go slaughter to יהוה.'
\v 18 So go now, serve; for you will not be given straw, yet you must deliver the quota of bricks."
\v 19 The foremen of the children of Yisra'el saw that they were in trouble because they were told, "You must not reduce \add your\add* daily amount of bricks."
\v 20 When they left Pharaoh's presence, they met Mosheh and Aharon as they were waiting for them.
\v 21 They said to them, "May יהוה look upon you and judge, for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."
\p
\v 22 And Mosheh returned to יהוה and said, "O יהוה, why have You brought harm to this people? Why did You send me?
\v 23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your Name, he has done harm to this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all."
\c 6
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand\f + \fr 6:1 \ft With a strong hand – Idiom meaning "under compulsion."\f* he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land."
\p
\ms פרשת וארא – Parashat Va'eira
\v 2 Elohim spoke further to Mosheh and said to him, "I am יהוה;
\v 3 and I appeared to Avraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya'aqov, as El Shaddai, but My Name, יהוה, I did not make known to them.
\v 4 I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Kena'an, the land in which they sojourned.
\v 5 Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the children of Yisra'el, because the Mitsrites are holding them in service, and I have remembered My covenant.
\v 6 Therefore, say to the children of Yisra'el, 'I am יהוה, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Mitsrites, and I will deliver you from their service. I will also redeem you with an outstretched Arm and with great judgments.
\v 7 And I will take you for My people, and I will be your Elohim; and you shall know that I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Mitsrites.
\v 8 I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya'aqov, and I will give it to you \add for\add* a possession; I am יהוה.'"
\v 9 So Mosheh spoke thus to the children of Yisra'el, but they did not listen to Mosheh on account of \add their\add* misery and harsh service.\f + \fr 6:9 \ft Sam. adds, "And they replied to Mosheh: 'Leave us, please, and we shall serve to Mitsrites because it is better for us to be servants of Mitsrites than to die in the wilderness." See also Shemoth 14:12.\f*
\p
\v 10 Now יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 11 "Go, tell Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim to let the children of Yisra'el go out of his land."
\v 12 But Mosheh spoke before יהוה, saying, "Behold, the children of Yisra'el have not listened to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am uncircumcised in speech?"
\v 13 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, and gave them a charge to the children of Yisra'el and to Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim, to bring the children of Yisra'el out of the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 14 These are the heads of their fathers' households. The sons of Reuven, Yisra'el's firstborn: Ḥanokh and Pallu, Ḥetsron and Karmi; these are the families of Reuven.
\p
\v 15 The sons of Shimon: Yemu'el and Yamin and Ohad and Yakin and Tsoḥar and Sha'ul the son of a Kena'anite woman; these are the families of Shimon.
\p
\v 16 These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Qohath and Merari; and the length of Levi's life was one hundred and thirty-seven years.
\v 17 The sons of Gershon: Livni and Shimei, according to their families.
\v 18 The sons of Qohath: Amram and Yitshar and Ḥevron and Uzzi'el; and the length of Qohath's life was one hundred and thirty-three years.
\v 19 The sons of Merari: Maḥli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.
\v 20 Amram married his father's sister Yokeved, and she bore him Aharon and Mosheh; and the length of Amram's life was one hundred and thirty-seven years.
\v 21 The sons of Yitshar: Qoraḥ and Nepheg and Ziḥri.
\v 22 The sons of Uzzi'el: Misha'el and Eltsaphan and Sithri.
\v 23 Aharon married Elisheva, the daughter of Amminadav, the sister of Naḥshon, and she bore him Nadav and Avihu, Elazar and Ithamar.
\v 24 The sons of Qoraḥ: Assir and Elqanah and Aviasaph; these are the families of the Qoraḥites.
\v 25 Aharon's son Elazar married one of the daughters of Puti'el, and she bore him Pineḥas. These are the heads of the fathers' \add households\add* of the Levites according to their families.
\p
\v 26 It was \add the same\add* Aharon and Mosheh to whom יהוה said, "Bring out the children of Yisra'el from the land of Mitsrayim according to their hosts."
\v 27 They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim about bringing out the children of Yisra'el from Mitsrayim; it was \add the same\add* Mosheh and Aharon.
\p
\v 28 Now it came about on the day when יהוה spoke to Mosheh in the land of Mitsrayim,
\v 29 that יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying, "I am יהוה; speak to Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim all that I speak to you."
\v 30 But Mosheh said before יהוה, "Behold, I am uncircumcised in speech; how then will Pharaoh listen to me?"
\c 7
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "See, I make you \add as\add* elohim to Pharaoh, and your brother Aharon shall be your prophet.
\v 2 You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aharon shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the children of Yisra'el go out of his land.
\v 3 But I will harden Pharaoh's heart that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 4 When Pharaoh does not listen to you, then I will lay My hand on Mitsrayim and bring out My hosts, My people the children of Yisra'el, from the land of Mitsrayim by great judgments.
\v 5 The Mitsrites shall know that I am יהוה, when I stretch out My hand on Mitsrayim and bring out the children of Yisra'el from their midst."
\v 6 So Mosheh and Aharon did; as יהוה commanded them, thus they did.
\v 7 Mosheh was eighty years old and Aharon eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
\p
\v 8 Now יהוה spoke to Mosheh and Aharon, saying,
\v 9 "When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Work a miracle,' then you shall say to Aharon, 'Take your staff and throw \add it\add* down before Pharaoh, \add and\add* it shall become a serpent.'"\f + \fr 7:9 \ft Hebrew word תנין (tannin) translated as "serpent" also translated as "dragon" (see Neḥemyah 2:13) and "sea monster" (see Bereshiyt 1:21). Some translations render this word as "crocodile." Nile crocodiles are noted as being nearly the largest of crocodiles in the world. The Nile crocodile was also worshipped as an el in Mitsrayim.\f*
\v 10 So Mosheh and Aharon came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as יהוה had commanded; and Aharon threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.
\v 11 And Pharaoh also called for \add the\add* wise men and \add the\add* sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Mitsrayim, did the same with their secret arts.
\v 12 For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents. But Aharon's staff swallowed up their staffs.
\v 13 Yet Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as יהוה had said.
\p
\v 14 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Pharaoh's heart is heavy; he refuses to let the people go.
\v 15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and station yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a naḥash.
\v 16 You shall say to him, 'יהוה, the Elohim of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, "Let My people go, so that they shall serve Me in the wilderness. But behold, you have not listened until now."
\p
\v 17 Thus says יהוה, "By this you shall know that I am יהוה: behold, I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the staff that is in my hand, and it will be turned to blood.
\v 18 The fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will become foul, and the Mitsrites will find difficulty in drinking water from the Nile."'"
\p
\v 19 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Say to Aharon, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Mitsrayim, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their reservoirs of water, so that they shall become blood; and there will be blood throughout all the land of Mitsrayim, both in \add vessels of\add* wood and in \add vessels of\add* stone.'"
\p
\v 20 So Mosheh and Aharon did even as יהוה had commanded. And he lifted up the staff and struck the water of the Nile, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, and all the water that \add was\add* in the Nile was turned to blood.
\v 21 The fish in the Nile died, and the Nile became foul, so that the Mitsrites could not drink water from the Nile. And the blood was through all the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 22 But the magicians of Mitsrayim did the same with their secret arts; and Pharaoh's heart was strengthened, and he did not listen to them, as יהוה had said.
\v 23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even for this.
\v 24 So all the Mitsrites dug around the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the Nile.
\v 25 Seven days passed after יהוה had struck the Nile.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says יהוה, "Let My people go, so that they shall serve Me.
\v 2 But if you refuse to let \add them\add* go, behold, I will strike your whole territory with frogs.
\v 3 The Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls.
\v 4 So the frogs will come up on you and your people and all your servants."'"
\v 5 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Say to Aharon, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Mitsrayim.'"
\v 6 So Aharon stretched out his hand over the waters of Mitsrayim, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 7 The magicians did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up on the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 8 And Pharaoh called for Mosheh and Aharon and said, "Entreat יהוה that He remove the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may slaughter to יהוה."
\v 9 Mosheh said to Pharaoh, "The honor is yours to tell me: when shall I petition for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs be cut \add off\add* from you and your houses, so that they shall be left only in the Nile?"
\p
\v 10 And he said, "Tomorrow." So he said, "\add May it be\add* according to your word, so that you shall know that there is no one like יהוה our Elohim.
\v 11 The frogs will depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they will be left only in the Nile."
\v 12 And Mosheh and Aharon went out from Pharaoh, and Mosheh cried to יהוה concerning the frogs which He had inflicted upon Pharaoh.
\v 13 יהוה did according to the word of Mosheh, and the frogs died out of the houses, the courts, and the fields.
\v 14 So they piled them in heaps, and the land became foul.
\v 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, as יהוה had said.
\p
\v 16 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Say to Aharon, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it shall become gnats\f + \fr 8:16 \ft Hebrew word כן (kein) translated as "gnat" identifies a species which is debated. Some translations read "lice" though there is no known species of lice that affects man and beast.\f* through all the land of Mitsrayim.'"
\v 17 They did so; and Aharon stretched out his hand with his staff, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats through all the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 18 The magicians tried with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; so there were gnats on man and beast.
\v 19 And the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of Elohim." But Pharaoh's heart was strengthened, and he did not listen to them, as יהוה had said.
\p
\v 20 Now יהוה said to Mosheh, "Rise early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, as he comes out to the water, and say to him, 'Thus says יהוה, "Let My people go, so that they shall serve Me.
\v 21 For if you do not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of insects on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Mitsrites will be full of swarms of insects, and also the ground on which they \add dwell\add*.
\v 22 But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are living, so that no swarms of insects will be there, so that you shall know that I, יהוה, am in the midst of the land.
\v 23 I will put a division between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign will occur."'"
\v 24 And יהוה did so. And there came heavy swarms of insects into the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and the land was laid waste because of the swarms of insects in all the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 25 Pharaoh called for Mosheh and Aharon and said, "Go, slaughter to your Elohim within the land."
\v 26 But Mosheh said, "It is not right to do so, for we will slaughter to יהוה our Elohim what is an abomination to the Mitsrites. If we slaughter what is an abomination to the Mitsrites before their eyes, will they not then stone us?
\v 27 We must go a three days' journey into the wilderness and slaughter to יהוה our Elohim as He commands us."
\v 28 Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may slaughter to יהוה your Elohim in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me."
\v 29 And Mosheh said, "Behold, I am going out from you, and I shall pray to יהוה that the swarms of insects may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow; only do not let Pharaoh deal deceitfully again in not letting the people go to slaughter to יהוה."
\p
\v 30 So Mosheh went out from Pharaoh and prayed to יהוה.
\v 31 יהוה did as Mosheh asked, and removed the swarms of insects from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people; not one remained.
\v 32 But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Go to Pharaoh and speak to him, 'Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of the Hebrews, "Let My people go, so that they shall serve Me.
\v 2 For if you refuse to let \add them\add* go and continue to hold them,
\v 3 behold, the hand of יהוה will come \add with\add* a very heavy pestilence on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks.
\v 4 But יהוה will make a distinction between the livestock of Yisra'el and the livestock of Mitsrayim, so that nothing will die of all that belongs to the children of Yisra'el."'"
\v 5 יהוה set a definite time, saying, "Tomorrow יהוה will do this thing in the land."
\v 6 So יהוה did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Mitsrayim died; but of the livestock of the children of Yisra'el, not one died.
\v 7 Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not even one of the livestock of Yisra'el dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
\p
\v 8 And יהוה said to Mosheh and Aharon, "Take for yourselves handfuls of soot from a kiln, and let Mosheh throw it toward the heavens in the sight of Pharaoh.
\v 9 It will become fine dust over all the land of Mitsrayim, and will become boils breaking out with sores on man and beast through all the land of Mitsrayim."
\v 10 So they took soot from a kiln, and stood before Pharaoh; and Mosheh threw it toward the heavens, and it became boils breaking out with sores on man and beast.
\v 11 The magicians could not stand before Mosheh because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Mitsrites.
\v 12 And יהוה strengthened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not listen to them, just as יהוה had spoken to Mosheh.
\p
\v 13 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of the Hebrews, "Let My people go, so that they shall serve Me.
\v 14 For this time I will send all My plagues on you and your servants and your people, so that you shall know that there is no one like Me in all the earth.
\v 15 For \add if by\add* now I had put forth My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, you would then have been cut off from the earth.
\v 16 But, indeed, for this reason I have allowed you to remain, in order to show you My power and in order to proclaim My Name through all the earth.
\v 17 Still you exalt yourself against My people by not letting them go.
\p
\v 18 "Behold, about this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been \add seen\add* in Mitsrayim from the day it was founded until now.
\v 19 Now therefore send, bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety. Every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, will die."'"
\v 20 The one among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of יהוה made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses;
\v 21 but he who did not set his heart to the word of יהוה left his servants and his livestock in the field.
\p
\v 22 Now יהוה said to Mosheh, "Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, so that hail shall fall on all the land of Mitsrayim, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field, throughout the land of Mitsrayim."
\v 23 Mosheh stretched out his staff toward the heavens, and יהוה sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And יהוה rained hail on the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 24 So there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy, such as had not been in all the land of Mitsrayim since it became a nation.
\v 25 The hail struck all that was in the field through all the land of Mitsrayim, both man and beast; the hail also struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field.
\v 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Yisra'el \add were\add*, there was no hail.
\p
\v 27 And Pharaoh sent for Mosheh and Aharon, and said to them, "I have sinned this time; יהוה is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones.
\v 28 Make petitions to יהוה, for there has been enough of the thunder and hail\f + \fr 9:28 \ft LXX adds, "and fire" here.\f* of Elohim; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
\v 29 Mosheh said to him, "As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands to יהוה; the thunder will cease and there will be hail no longer, so that you shall know that the earth belongs to יהוה.
\v 30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear יהוה Elohim."
\v 31 (Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in aviv\f + \fr 9:31 \fk Aviv \ft that is, fresh and green.\f* and the flax was in bud.
\v 32 But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they \add ripen\add* late.)
\v 33 So Mosheh went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to יהוה; and the thunder and the hail ceased, and rain no longer poured on the earth.
\v 34 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
\v 35 Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not let the children of Yisra'el go, just as יהוה had spoken through Mosheh.
\c 10
פרשת בא – Parashat Bo
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, so that I shall perform these signs of Mine among them,
\v 2 and that you shall tell in the hearing of your son, and of your grandson, how I made a mockery of the Mitsrites and how I performed My signs among them, so that you shall know that I am יהוה."
\p
\v 3 Mosheh and Aharon went to Pharaoh and said to him, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, so that they shall serve Me.
\v 4 For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
\v 5 They shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land. They will also eat the rest of what has escaped-- what is left to you from the hail-- and they will eat every tree which sprouts for you out of the field.
\v 6 And your houses shall be filled and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Mitsrites, \add something\add* which neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day that they came upon the earth until this day.'" And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
\v 7 Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, so that they shall serve יהוה their Elohim. Do you not realize that Mitsrayim is destroyed?"
\v 8 So Mosheh and Aharon were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, serve יהוה your Elohim! Who are the ones that are going?"
\v 9 Mosheh said, "We shall go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we shall go, for we must hold a Feast to יהוה."
\v 10 And he said to them, "Thus shall יהוה be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Take heed, for evil is before you.
\v 11 Not so! Go now, the men \add among you\add*, and serve יהוה, for that is what you desire." So they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
\p
\v 12 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Mitsrayim for the locusts, so that they shall come up on the land of Mitsrayim and eat every plant of the land, \add even\add* all that the hail has left."
\v 13 So Mosheh stretched out his staff over the land of Mitsrayim, and יהוה directed an east wind on the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
\v 14 The locusts came up over all the land of Mitsrayim and settled in all the territory of Mitsrayim; \add they were\add* very heavy. There had never been so \add many\add* locusts, nor would there be so \add many\add* again.
\v 15 For they covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Thus nothing green was left on tree or plant of the field through all the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 16 And Pharaoh quickly called for Mosheh and Aharon, and he said, "I have sinned against יהוה your Elohim and against you.
\v 17 Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and pray to יהוה your Elohim, that He would only remove this death from me."
\v 18 He went out from Pharaoh and prayed to יהוה.
\v 19 So יהוה shifted \add the wind\add* to a very strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the Sea of Reeds; not one locust was left in all the territory of Mitsrayim.
\v 20 But יהוה strengthened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Yisra'el go.
\p
\v 21 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, that there shall be darkness over the land of Mitsrayim, even a darkness which shall be felt."
\v 22 So Mosheh stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Mitsrayim for three days.
\v 23 They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the children of Yisra'el had light in their dwellings.
\v 24 And Pharaoh called to Mosheh, and said, "Go, serve יהוה; only let your flocks and your herds remain. Even your little ones shall go with you."
\v 25 But Mosheh said, "You must also let us have sacrifices and ascension offerings, that we may make \add offerings\add* to יהוה our Elohim.
\v 26 Therefore, our livestock too shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we shall take some of them to serve יהוה our Elohim. And until we arrive there, we ourselves do not know with what we shall serve יהוה."
\v 27 But יהוה strengthened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
\v 28 And Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Beware, do not see my face again, for in the day you see my face you shall die!"
\v 29 Mosheh said, "You are right; I shall never see your face again!"
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now יהוה said to Mosheh, "One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Mitsrayim; after that he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out from here completely.
\v 2 Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man ask from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and articles of gold."
\v 3 יהוה gave the people favor in the sight of the Mitsrites. Furthermore, the man Mosheh was greatly esteemed in the land of Mitsrayim, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.
\p
\v 4 Mosheh said, "Thus says יהוה, 'About midnight I am going out into the midst of Mitsrayim,
\v 5 and all the firstborn in the land of Mitsrayim shall die, from the firstborn of the Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the millstones; all the firstborn of the cattle as well.
\v 6 Moreover, there shall be a great cry in all the land of Mitsrayim, such as there has not been and such as shall never be again.
\v 7 But against any of the children of Yisra'el a dog will not bark, whether against man or beast, so that you shall understand how יהוה makes a distinction between Mitsrayim and Yisra'el.'
\v 8 All these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me, saying, 'Go out, you and all the people who follow you,' and after that I will go out." And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
\p
\v 9 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders will be multiplied in the land of Mitsrayim."
\v 10 Mosheh and Aharon performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; yet יהוה strengthened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Yisra'el go out of his land.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Mosheh and Aharon in the land of Mitsrayim,
\v 2 "This new moon shall be the beginning of new moons for you; it is to be the first new moon of the year to you.
\v 3 Speak to all the congregation of Yisra'el, saying, 'On the tenth of this new moon they are each one to take a lamb for themselves, according to their fathers' households, a lamb for each household.
\v 4 Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to take one according to the number of persons; according to what each man should eat, you are to divide the lamb.
\v 5 Your lamb shall be an unblemished male of the first year; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
\v 6 You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same new moon, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Yisra'el is to kill it between the evenings.
\v 7 Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
\v 8 They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
\v 9 Do not eat any of it raw or cooked at all with water, but rather roasted with fire, its head and its legs along with its entrails.
\v 10 And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but whatever is left of it until morning, you shall burn with fire.
\p
\v 11 "Now you shall eat it in this manner: \add with\add* your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste-- it is the Pesaḥ of יהוה.
\v 12 For I will go through the land of Mitsrayim on that night, and will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Mitsrayim, both man and beast; and against all the elohim of Mitsrayim I will execute judgments-- I am יהוה.
\v 13 The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy \add you\add* when I strike the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 14 Now this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate a Feast to יהוה; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it \add as\add* a permanent ordinance.
\v 15 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall cause leaven to cease from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Yisra'el.
\v 16 On the first day you shall have a set-apart rehearsal,\f + \fr 12:16 \ft See footnote at Vayyiqra 23:2.\f* and \add another\add* set-apart rehearsal on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person, that alone shall be prepared by you.
\v 17 You shall also guard \add the Feast of\add* Unleavened Bread, for in the strength of the day I brought your hosts out of the land of Mitsrayim; therefore you shall guard this day throughout your generations as a permanent statute.
\v 18 In the first \add new moon\add*, on the fourteenth day of the new moon at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the new moon at evening.
\v 19 Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Yisra'el, whether a sojourner or a native-born of the land.
\v 20 You shall not eat anything leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.'"
\p
\v 21 And Mosheh called for all the elders of Yisra'el and said to them, "Go and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and slay the Pesaḥ.
\v 22 You shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning.
\p
\v 23 "For יהוה will pass through to strike the Mitsrites; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, יהוה will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike \add you\add*.
\v 24 And you shall guard this event as a statute for you and your children forever.
\v 25 When you enter the land which יהוה will give you, as He has promised, you shall guard this service.
\v 26 And when your children say to you, 'What does this service mean to you?'
\v 27 you shall say, 'It is a Pesaḥ sacrifice to יהוה, who passed over the houses of the children of Yisra'el in Mitsrayim when He struck the Mitsrites, but spared our homes.'" And the people stooped low and bowed down.
\p
\v 28 And the children of Yisra'el went and did; just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh and Aharon, so they did.
\p
\v 29 Now it came about at midnight that יהוה struck all the firstborn in the land of Mitsrayim, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.
\v 30 Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Mitsrites, and there was a great cry in Mitsrayim, for there was no home where there was not someone dead.
\v 31 And he called for Mosheh and Aharon at night and said, "Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Yisra'el; and go, serve יהוה, as you have said.
\v 32 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and bless me also."
\p
\v 33 The Mitsrites urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, "We will all be dead."
\v 34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls bound up in the clothes on their shoulders.
\p
\v 35 Now the children of Yisra'el had done according to the word of Mosheh, for they had requested from the Mitsrites articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing;
\v 36 and יהוה had given the people favor in the sight of the Mitsrites, so that they let them have their request. Thus they plundered the Mitsrites.
\p
\v 37 Now the children of Yisra'el journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth, about six-hundred thousand men on foot, aside from children.
\v 38 A mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, very heavy livestock.
\v 39 They baked the dough which they had brought out of Mitsrayim into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Mitsrayim and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.
\p
\v 40 Now the time that the children of Yisra'el lived in Mitsrayim was four hundred and thirty years.\f + \fr 12:40 \ft Sam. and LXX read, "...lived in Mitsrayim and Kena'an..."\f*
\v 41 And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the hosts of יהוה went out from the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 42 It is a night to be observed for יהוה for having brought them out from the land of Mitsrayim; this night is for יהוה, to be observed by all the children of Yisra'el throughout their generations.
\p
\v 43 יהוה said to Mosheh and Aharon, "This is the statute of the Pesaḥ: no foreigner is to eat of it;
\v 44 but every man's slave purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.
\v 45 A guest or a hired servant shall not eat of it.
\v 46 It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to bring forth any of the flesh outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of it.
\v 47 All the congregation of Yisra'el are to celebrate this.
\v 48 But if a sojourner dwells with you, and celebrates the Pesaḥ to יהוה, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near to celebrate it; and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
\p
\v 49 "The same Torah shall apply to the native \add born\add* as to the sojourner who dwells among you."
\p
\v 50 And all the children of Yisra'el did; they did just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh and Aharon.
\v 51 And on that same day יהוה brought the children of Yisra'el out of the land of Mitsrayim by their hosts.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Set apart to Me every firstborn, whatever opens \add the\add* womb\f + \fr 13:2 \ft Opens the womb – Idiom meaning "that which is born first."\f* among the children of Yisra'el, both of man and beast; it belongs to Me."
\p
\v 3 Mosheh said to the people, "Remember this day in which you went out [from the land]\f + \fr 13:3 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading present in the DSS, Sam., and the LXX but absent from the Heb. MT.\f* of Mitsrayim, from the house of slavery; for by a powerful hand יהוה brought you out from this place. And nothing leavened shall be eaten.
\v 4 On this day in the new moon of the aviv, you are about to go forth.
\v 5 It shall be when יהוה brings you to the land of the Kena'anite, the Ḥittite, the Amorite, the Ḥivite and the Yevusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall serve this service in this new moon.
\v 6 For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to יהוה.
\v 7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor shall any leaven be seen among you in all your borders.
\v 8 You shall tell your son on that day, saying, 'It is because of what יהוה did for me when I came out of Mitsrayim.'
\v 9 And it shall be for sign to you on your hand, and for a reminder between your eyes, so that the Torah of יהוה shall be in your mouth. For with a strong hand יהוה brought you out of Mitsrayim.
\v 10 Therefore, you shall guard this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
\p
\v 11 "Now when יהוה brings you to the land of the Kena'anite, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,
\v 12 you shall devote to יהוה all that opens \add the\add* womb, and that which opens \add the\add* womb of every beast that you own; the males belong to יהוה.
\v 13 But all that opens the womb of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem \add it\add*, then you shall break its neck; and every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem.
\v 14 And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' then you shall say to him, 'With a powerful hand יהוה brought us out of Mitsrayim, from the house of slavery.
\v 15 It came about, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that יהוה killed every firstborn in the land of Mitsrayim, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore, I slaughter to יהוה the males, whatever opens \add the\add* womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.'
\v 16 So it shall be for a sign on your hand and for frontlets between your eyes, for with a powerful hand יהוה brought us out of Mitsrayim."
\p
\ms פרשת בשלח – Parashat Beshalaḥ
\v 17 Now when Pharaoh had let the people go, Elohim did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was near; for Elohim said, "The people might change their minds when they see war, and return to Mitsrayim."
\v 18 Hence Elohim led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Sea of Reeds; and the children of Yisra'el went up in military formation from the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 19 Mosheh took the bones of Yoseph with him, for he had made the children of Yisra'el solemnly swear, saying, "Elohim will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones from here with you."
\v 20 Then they set out from Sukkoth and camped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
\v 21 יהוה was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.
\v 22 He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Now יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "Tell the children of Yisra'el to turn back and camp before Pi-haḥiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Ba'al-Tsephon, opposite it, by the sea.
\v 3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Yisra'el, 'They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.'
\v 4 Thus I will strengthen Pharaoh's heart, and he will chase after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Mitsrites will know that I am יהוה." And they did so.
\p
\v 5 When the king of Mitsrayim was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Yisra'el go from serving us?"
\v 6 So he made his chariot ready and took his people with him;
\v 7 and he took six hundred select chariots, and all the \add other\add* chariots of Mitsrayim with officers over all of them.
\v 8 יהוה strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Mitsrayim, and he chased after the children of Yisra'el as the children of Yisra'el were going out boldly.
\v 9 And the Mitsrites chased after them \add with\add* all the horses \add and\add* chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-haḥiroth, in front of Ba'al-Tsephon.
\p
\v 10 As Pharaoh drew near, the children of Yisra'el looked, and behold, the Mitsrites were marching after them, and they became very frightened; so the children of Yisra'el cried out to יהוה.
\v 11 And they said to Mosheh, "Is it because there were no graves in Mitsrayim that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt with us in this way, bringing us out of Mitsrayim?
\v 12 Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Mitsrayim, saying, 'Leave us alone so that we may serve the Mitsrites'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Mitsrites than to die in the wilderness.'"
\p
\v 13 But Mosheh said to the people, "Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of יהוה which He will accomplish for you today; for the Mitsrites whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.
\v 14 יהוה will fight for you while you keep silent."
\p
\v 15 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the children of Yisra'el to go forward.
\v 16 As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, and the children of Yisra'el shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land.
\v 17 As for Me, behold, I will strengthen the hearts of the Mitsrites so that they will go in after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
\v 18 And the Mitsrites will know that I am יהוה, when I am honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots and his horsemen."
\p
\v 19 The messenger of Elohim, who had been going before the camp of Yisra'el, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.
\v 20 So it came between the camp of Mitsrayim and the camp of Yisra'el; and there was the cloud along with the darkness, yet it gave light at night. Thus the one did not come near the other all night.
\p
\v 21 And Mosheh stretched out his hand over the sea; and יהוה swept the sea \add back\add* by a strong east wind all night and turned the sea into dry land, so the waters were divided.
\v 22 The children of Yisra'el went through the midst of the sea on the dry land, and the waters \add were like\add* a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
\v 23 And the Mitsrites took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea.
\v 24 At the morning watch, יהוה looked down on the army of the Mitsrites through the pillar of fire and cloud and brought the army of the Mitsrites into confusion.
\v 25 And He took off\f + \fr 14:25 \ft Syr. and LXX read "jammed" or "clogged" instead of "took off." DSS agree with Masoretic Hebrew as it is here.\f* their chariot wheels, and He made them drive with difficulty; so the Mitsrites said, "Let us flee from Yisra'el, for יהוה is fighting for them against the Mitsrites."
\p
\v 26 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters shall come back over the Mitsrites, over their chariots and their horsemen."
\v 27 So Mosheh stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state at daybreak, while the Mitsrites were fleeing right into it; then יהוה overthrew the Mitsrites in the midst of the sea.
\v 28 The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even Pharaoh's entire army that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them remained.
\v 29 But the children of Yisra'el walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters \add were like\add* a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
\p
\v 30 Thus יהוה saved Yisra'el that day from the hand of the Mitsrites, and Yisra'el saw the Mitsrites dead on the seashore.
\v 31 When Yisra'el saw the great power which יהוה had used against the Mitsrites, the people feared יהוה, and they trusted in יהוה and in His servant Mosheh.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 And Mosheh and the children of Yisra'el sang this song to יהוה, and said,
\b
\q1 "I will sing to יהוה,
\q2 for He is highly exalted;
\q1 the horse and its rider
\q2 He has hurled into the sea.
\b
\v 2 "Yah is my strength and song,
\q2 and He has become my salvation;
\q1 this is my El, and I will praise Him;
\q2 My father's El, and I will extol Him.
\b
\v 3 "יהוה is a warrior;
\q2 יהוה is His Name.
\b
\v 4 "Pharaoh's chariots and his army
\q2 He has cast into the sea;
\q1 and the choicest of his officers
\q2 are drowned in the Sea of Reeds.
\b
\v 5 "The deeps cover them;
\q2 they went down into the depths like a stone.
\b
\v 6 "Your right hand, O יהוה,
\q2 is majestic in power,
\q1 Your right hand, O יהוה,
\q2 shatters the enemy.
\b
\v 7 "And in the greatness of Your excellence
\q2 You overthrow those who rise up against You;
\q1 You send forth Your burning anger,
\q2 it consumes them as chaff.
\b
\v 8 "At the blast of Your nostrils
\q2 the waters were piled up,
\q1 the flowing waters stood up like a heap;
\q2 the deeps were thickened in the heart of the sea.
\b
\v 9 "The enemy said,
\q2 'I will pursue, I will overtake,
\q1 I will divide the spoil;
\q2 my desire shall be gratified against them;

\b
\v 10 "You blew with Your wind,
\q2 the sea covered them;
\q1 they sank like lead
\q2 in the mighty waters.
\b
\v 11 "Who is like You
\q2 among the elohim, O יהוה?
\q1 Who is like You,
\q2 majestic in set-apartness,
\q1 awesome in praises,
\q2 working wonders?
\b
\v 12 "You stretched out Your right hand,
\q2 the earth swallowed them.
\b
\v 13 "In Your loving-kindness You have led
\q2 the people whom You have redeemed;
\q1 in Your strength You have guided \add them\add*
\q2 to Your set-apart habitation.
\b
\v 14 "The peoples have heard, they tremble;
\q2 anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.
\b
\v 15 "And the chiefs of Edom were dismayed;
\q2 the leaders of Moav, trembling grips them;
\q1 all the inhabitants of Kena'an have melted away.
\b
\v 16 "Terror and dread fall upon them;
\q2 by the greatness of Your Arm
\q1 they are motionless as stone;

\q1 until the people pass over

\b
\v 17 "You will bring them and plant them

\q2 which You have made for Your dwelling,
\q1 the set-apart place, O יהוה,

\b
\v 18 "יהוה shall reign
\q2 forever and ever.
\b
\v 19 "For the horses of Pharaoh
\q2 with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea,
\q1 and יהוה brought back
\q2 the waters of the sea on them,
\q1 but the children of Yisra'el
\q2 walked on dry land through the midst of the sea."
\p
\v 20 Miryam the prophetess, Aharon's sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.
\p
\v 21 Miryam answered them,
\b
\q1 "Sing to יהוה,
\q2 for He is highly exalted;
\q1 the horse and his rider
\q2 He has hurled into the sea."
\p
\v 22 And Mosheh led Yisra'el from the Sea of Reeds, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
\v 23 When they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah.
\v 24 So the people grumbled at Mosheh, saying, "What shall we drink?"
\v 25 And he cried out to יהוה, and יהוה showed him a tree; and he threw it into the waters, and the waters became sweet.\f + \fr 15:25 \ft Sweet water – Idiom meaning "water fit for consumption."\f* There He made for them a statute and judgment, and there He tested them.
\v 26 And He said, "If you will give earnest heed to the voice of יהוה your Elohim, and do what is right in His eyes, and give ear to His commands, and guard all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Mitsrites; for I, יהוה, am your healer."
\p
\v 27 And they came to Elim where there \add were\add* twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they camped there beside the waters.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 And they set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second new moon after their departure from the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 2 The whole congregation of the children of Yisra'el grumbled against Mosheh and Aharon in the wilderness.
\v 3 The children of Yisra'el said to them, "Would that we had died by the hand of יהוה in the land of Mitsrayim, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
\p
\v 4 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Behold, I will rain bread from the heavens for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My Torot.
\v 5 On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily."
\v 6 So Mosheh and Aharon said to all the children of Yisra'el, "At evening you will know that יהוה has brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim;
\v 7 and in the morning you will see the glory of יהוה, for He hears your grumblings against יהוה; and what are we, that you grumble against us?"
\p
\v 8 Mosheh said, "\add This will happen\add* when יהוה gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning; for יהוה hears your grumblings which you grumble against Him. And what are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against יהוה."
\p
\v 9 And Mosheh said to Aharon, "Say to all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, 'Come near before יהוה, for He has heard your grumblings.'"
\v 10 It came about as Aharon spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Yisra'el, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of יהוה appeared in the cloud.
\v 11 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 12 "I have heard the grumblings of the children of Yisra'el; speak to them, saying, 'Between the evenings you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am יהוה your Elohim.'"
\p
\v 13 So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
\v 14 When the layer of dew was gone up, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the ground.
\v 15 When the children of Yisra'el saw \add it\add*, they said to one another, "What is it?"\f + \fr 16:15 \ft The Hebrew phrase here for "What is it?" is מן הוא (mahn hu). As a single word, this is shortened to "manna," and so it was named.\f* For they did not know what it was. And Mosheh said to them, "It is the bread which יהוה has given you to eat.
\v 16 This is what יהוה has commanded, 'Gather of it every man as much as he should eat; you shall take an omer apiece according to the number of persons each of you has in his tent.'"
\p
\v 17 The children of Yisra'el did so, and \add some\add* gathered much and \add some\add* little.
\v 18 When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had no excess, and he who had gathered little had no lack; every man gathered as much as he should eat.
\v 19 Mosheh said to them, "Let no man leave any of it until morning."
\v 20 But they did not listen to Mosheh, and some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Mosheh was angry with them.
\v 21 They gathered it morning by morning, every man as much as he should eat; but when the sun grew hot, it would melt.
\p
\v 22 Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Mosheh,
\v 23 then he said to them, "This is what יהוה spoke: tomorrow is a ceasing \add of labor\add*, a set-apart Sabbath to יהוה. Bake what you will bake and cook what you will cook, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning."
\v 24 So they put it aside until morning, as Mosheh had ordered, and it did not become foul nor was there any worm in it.
\v 25 Mosheh said, "Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to יהוה; today you will not find it in the field.
\v 26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, \add the\add* Sabbath, there will be none."
\p
\v 27 It came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.
\v 28 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "How long do you refuse to guard My commands and My Torot?
\v 29 See, יהוה has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Remain every man in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."
\v 30 So the people ceased on the seventh day.
\p
\v 31 The house of Yisra'el named it manna, and it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like wafers with honey.
\v 32 And Mosheh said, "This is what יהוה has commanded, 'Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they shall see the bread that I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim.'"
\v 33 Mosheh said to Aharon, "Take a jar and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before יהוה to be kept throughout your generations."
\v 34 As יהוה commanded Mosheh, so Aharon placed it before the Witness, to be kept.
\v 35 The children of Yisra'el ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Kena'an.
\v 36 (Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.)
\c 17
\p
\v 1 And all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el journeyed by stages from the wilderness of Sin, according to the command of יהוה, and camped at Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.
\v 2 Therefore the people quarreled with Mosheh and said, "Give us water that we may drink." And Mosheh said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test יהוה?"
\v 3 But the people thirsted there for water; and they grumbled against Mosheh and said, "Why, now, have you brought us up from Mitsrayim, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?"
\v 4 So Mosheh cried out to יהוה, saying, "What shall I do to this people? A little more and they will stone me."
\v 5 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Yisra'el; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
\v 6 Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Ḥorev; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people shall drink." And Mosheh did so in the sight of the elders of Yisra'el.
\v 7 He named the place Massah and Merivah because of the quarrel of the children of Yisra'el, and because they tested יהוה, saying, "Is יהוה among us, or not?"
\p
\v 8 And Amaleq came and fought against Yisra'el at Rephidim.
\v 9 So Mosheh said to Yehoshua, "Choose men for us and go out, fight against Amaleq. Tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill with the staff of Elohim in my hand."
\v 10 Yehoshua did as Mosheh told him, and fought against Amaleq; and Mosheh, Aharon, and Ḥur went up to the top of the hill.
\v 11 So it came about when Mosheh held his hand up, that Yisra'el prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amaleq prevailed.
\v 12 But Mosheh's hands were heavy. And they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aharon and Ḥur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other. Thus his hands were steady until the sun set.
\v 13 So Yehoshua overwhelmed Amaleq and his people with the edge of the sword.
\p
\v 14 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Yehoshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amaleq from under the heavens."
\v 15 Mosheh built an altar and named it 'יהוה is My Banner;'
\v 16 and he said, "Yah has sworn; יהוה will have war against Amaleq from generation to generation."
\c 18
\ms פרשת יתרו – Parashat Yithro
\p
\v 1 Now Yithro, the priest of Midian, Mosheh's father-in-law, heard of all that Elohim had done for Mosheh and for Yisra'el His people, how יהוה had brought Yisra'el out of Mitsrayim.
\v 2 Yithro, Mosheh's father-in-law, took Mosheh's wife Tsipporah, after he had sent her away,
\v 3 and her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom, for Mosheh said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
\v 4 The other was named Eliezer, for \add he said\add*, "The Elohim of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh."
\p
\v 5 And Yithro, Mosheh's father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Mosheh in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mount of Elohim.
\v 6 He sent word to Mosheh, "I, your father-in-law Yithro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her."
\v 7 And Mosheh went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent.
\v 8 Mosheh told his father-in-law all that יהוה had done to Pharaoh and to the Mitsrites for Yisra'el's sake, all the hardship that had befallen them on the journey, and \add how\add* יהוה had delivered them.
\v 9 Yithro rejoiced over all the goodness which יהוה had done to Yisra'el, in delivering them from the hand of the Mitsrites.
\v 10 So Yithro said, "Blessed be יהוה who delivered you from the hand of the Mitsrites and from the hand of Pharaoh, \add and\add* who delivered the people from under the hand of the Mitsrites.
\v 11 Now I know that יהוה is greater than all the elohim; indeed, it was proven when they dealt proudly against the people."
\v 12 And Yithro, Mosheh's father-in-law, took an ascension offering and sacrifices for Elohim, and Aharon came with all the elders of Yisra'el to eat a meal with Mosheh's father-in-law before Elohim.
\p
\v 13 It came about the next day that Mosheh sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Mosheh from the morning until the evening.
\v 14 Now when Mosheh's father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, "What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit, and all the people stand about you from morning until evening?"
\v 15 Mosheh said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of Elohim.
\v 16 "When they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor and make known the statutes of Elohim and His Torot."
\p
\v 17 Mosheh's father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you are doing is not good.
\v 18 You will surely wear out, both yourself and these people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.
\v 19 Now listen to me: I will give you counsel, and Elohim be with you. You be the people's representative before Elohim, and you bring the disputes to Elohim,
\v 20 then teach them the statutes and the Torot, and make known to them the way in which they are to walk and the work they are to do.
\v 21 Furthermore, you shall select out of all the people able men who fear Elohim, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain; and you shall place \add these\add* over them as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens.
\v 22 Let them judge the people at all times; and let it be that every major dispute they will bring to you, but every minor dispute they themselves will judge. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear \add the burden\add* with you.
\v 23 If you do this thing and Elohim \add so\add* commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace."
\p
\v 24 So Mosheh listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
\v 25 Mosheh chose able men out of all Yisra'el and made them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens.
\v 26 They judged the people at all times; the difficult dispute they would bring to Mosheh, but every minor dispute they themselves would judge.
\v 27 And Mosheh bade his father-in-law farewell, and he went his way into his own land.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 In the third new moon after the children of Yisra'el had gone out of the land of Mitsrayim, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
\v 2 When they set out from Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness; and there Yisra'el camped in front of the mountain.
\v 3 Mosheh went up to Elohim, and יהוה called to him from the mountain, saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Ya'aqov and tell the children of Yisra'el:
\v 4 You yourselves have seen what I did to the Mitsrites, and \add how\add* I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to Myself.
\v 5 Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and guard My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine;
\v 6 and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a set-apart nation.' These are the words that you shall speak to the children of Yisra'el."
\p
\v 7 So Mosheh came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which יהוה had commanded him.
\v 8 All the people answered together and said, "All that יהוה has spoken we will do!" And Mosheh brought back the words of the people to יהוה.
\v 9 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people shall hear when I speak with you and shall also trust in you forever." And Mosheh told the words of the people to יהוה.
\p
\v 10 יהוה also said to Mosheh, "Go to the people and set them apart today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments;
\v 11 and let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day יהוה will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
\v 12 You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, 'Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
\v 13 No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, he shall not live.' When the yovel sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain."
\v 14 So Mosheh went down from the mountain to the people and set the people apart, and they washed their garments.
\v 15 He said to the people, "Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman."
\p
\v 16 So it came about on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and lightning flashes and a heavy cloud upon the mountain and a voice of an exceedingly loud shofar, so that all the people who \add were\add* in the camp trembled.
\v 17 And Mosheh brought the people out of the camp to meet Elohim, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
\p
\v 18 Now Mount Sinai \add was\add* all in smoke because יהוה descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently.
\v 19 When the voice of the shofar sounded long and grew louder, Mosheh spoke and Elohim answered him with thunder.
\v 20 יהוה came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and יהוה called Mosheh to the top of the mountain, and Mosheh went up.
\v 21 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, "Go down, warn the people, so that they do not break through to יהוה to gaze, and many of them perish.
\v 22 Also let the priests who come near to יהוה set themselves apart, or else יהוה will break out against them."
\v 23 Mosheh said to יהוה, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You warned us, saying, 'Set bounds about the mountain and set it apart.'"
\v 24 And יהוה said to him, "Go down and come up, you and Aharon with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to יהוה, or He will break forth upon them."
\v 25 So Mosheh went down to the people and told them.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 And Elohim spoke all these words, saying,
\p
\v 2 "I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the house of slavery.
\p
\v 3 "You shall have no other elohim before Me.
\p
\v 4 "You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heavens above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.
\v 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, יהוה your Elohim, am a jealous El, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,
\v 6 but showing loving-kindness to thousands, to those who love Me and guard My commands.
\p
\v 7 "You shall not bring the Name of יהוה your Elohim to naught, for יהוה will not leave him unpunished who brings His Name to naught.
\p
\v 8 "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it set-apart.
\v 9 Six days you shall serve and do all your work,
\v 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath of יהוה your Elohim; \add in it\add* you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who dwells with you.
\v 11 For in six days יהוה made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore יהוה blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart.
\v 12 "Honor your father and your mother, so that your days shall be prolonged in the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you.
\v 13 "You shall not murder.
\v 14 "You shall not commit adultery.
\v 15 "You shall not steal.
\v 16 "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
\v 17 "You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor."\f + \fr 20:17 \ft Sam. adds the following to the end of verse 17: "And when it so happens that יהוה Elohim brings you to the land of Kena'an, which you are coming to possess, you shall set up there for you great stones and plaster them with plaster and you write on the stones all words of this Torah. And it becomes for you that across the Yarden you shall raise these stones, which I command you today, in mount Gerizim. And you build there the altar to יהוה Elohim. An altar of stones. You shall not wave on them iron. With whole stones you shall build the altar to יהוה your Elohim. And you bring on it ascension offerings to יהוה your Elohim, and you slaughter peace offerings, and you eat there and you rejoice before the face of יהוה your Elohim. The mountain this is across the Yarden behind the way of the rising of the sun, in the land of Kena'an who is dwelling in the desert before Gilgal, beside Alvin-Mara, before Shekhem."\f*
\p
\v 18 All the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the voice of the shofar and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw \add it\add*, they trembled and stood at a distance.
\v 19 And they said to Mosheh, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen; but let not Elohim speak to us, or we will die."
\v 20 Mosheh said to the people, "Do not be afraid; for Elohim has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him shall remain with you, so that you shall not sin."
\v 21 So the people stood at a distance, while Mosheh approached the thick cloud where Elohim \add was\add*.
\p
\v 22 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Thus you shall say to the children of Yisra'el, 'You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from the heavens.
\v 23 You shall not make \add other elohim\add* besides Me; elohim of silver or elohim of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.
\v 24 You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall slaughter on it your ascension offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My Name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.
\v 25 If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your tool on it, you will profane it.
\v 26 And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness will not be exposed on it.'"

\v 1 "Now these are the judgments which you are to set before them:
\p
\v 2 "If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years; but on the seventh he shall go out as a free man without payment.
\v 3 If he comes alone, he shall go out alone; if he is the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go out with him.
\v 4 If his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out alone.
\v 5 But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not go out as a free man,'
\v 6 then his master shall bring him to the judges,\f + \fr 21:6 \fk The judges \ft Actual Hebrew word here is האלהים (ha'elohim), meaning "elohim." The LXX renders this as Θεος (Theos). However, the Syr. and Targum Onqelos both read "judges."\f* then he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him permanently.
\p
\v 7 "If a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she is not to go free as the male slaves do.
\v 8 If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He does not have authority to sell her to a foreign people because of his deceitfulness to her.
\v 9 If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her according to the judgment of daughters.
\v 10 If he takes to himself another woman, he shall not reduce her food, her covering,\f + \fr 21:10 \fk Covering \ft Hebrew word translated as "covering" is כסות (kesuth) which is typically rendered as "clothing" or "garments." However, Shemoth 22:9 uses the word שלמה (salmah) for "clothing" or "garment." The difference is, kesuth is from the root word כסה (kasah) meaning "covered." This implies that the man is not merely denying the woman her rights to have clothing, but rather he is denying her a "covering."\f* or her marital rights.
\v 11 If he will not do these three \add things\add* for her, then she shall go out for nothing, without \add payment of\add* money.
\p
\v 12 "He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.
\v 13 But if he did not lie in wait \add for him\add*, but Elohim let \add him\add* fall into his hand, then I will appoint you a place to which he shall flee.

\v 15 "He who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 16 "He who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 17 "He who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 18 "If men have a quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with \add his\add* fist, and he does not die but remains in bed,
\v 19 if he gets up and walks around outside on his staff, then he who struck him shall go unpunished; he shall only pay for his loss of time, and shall take care of him until he is completely healed.
\p
\v 20 "If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished.
\v 21 If, however, he survives a day or \add multiple\add* days, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property.
\p
\v 22 "If men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she gives birth prematurely,\f + \fr 21:22 \ft "...so that she gives birth prematurely..." – Literally "so that her fruit departs from her..."\f* yet there is no injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband shall demand of him, and he shall pay as the judges \add decide\add*.

\v 27 And if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave, he shall let him go free on account of his tooth.
\p
\v 28 "If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall surely be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall go unpunished.
\v 29 If, however, an ox was previously prone to goring and its owner has been warned, yet he does not confine it and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death.
\v 30 If a ransom is demanded of him, then he shall give for the redemption of his being whatever is demanded of him.
\v 31 Whether it gores a son or a daughter, it shall be done to him according to the same judgment.
\v 32 If the ox gores a male or female slave, the owner shall give his \add or her\add* master thirty sheqels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

\v 5 "If a man lets a field or vineyard be grazed \add bare\add* and lets his animal loose so that it grazes in another man's field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard.
\p
\v 6 "If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes, so that stacked grain or the standing grain or the field \add itself\add* is consumed, he who started the fire shall surely make restitution.
\p
\v 7 "If a man gives his neighbor money or goods to guard \add for him\add* and it is stolen from the man's house, if the thief is caught, he shall pay double.

\v 12 But if it is actually stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner.
\v 13 If it is all torn to pieces, let him bring it as a witness; he shall not make restitution for what has been torn to pieces.

\v 14 "If a man borrows \add anything\add* from his neighbor, and it is injured or dies while its owner is not with it, he shall make full restitution.
\v 15 If its owner is with it, he shall not make restitution; if it is hired, it came for its hire.

\v 8 "You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of the just.
\p
\v 9 "You shall not oppress a sojourner, since you yourselves know the being of a sojourner, for you \add also\add* were sojourners in the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 10 "You shall sow your land for six years and gather in its yield,
\v 11 but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, so that the needy of your people shall eat; and whatever they leave the beast of the field shall eat. You are to do the same with your vineyard \add and\add* your olive grove.

\v 18 "You shall not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; nor is the fat of My Feast to remain overnight until morning.
\rem Shouldn't verse 18 use "You shall not sacrifice..." instead of "You shall not slaughter..." and denote in a footnote what the other possible translation is? It feels very out of place to choose the word "slaughter" in this particular case. / Johan Thorén 2018-04-04 18:53 CET

\v 23 "For My messenger will go before you and bring you in to \add the land of\add* the Amorites, the Ḥittites, the Perizzites, the Kena'anites, the Ḥivites and the Yevusites; and I will completely destroy them.

\v 1 And He said to Mosheh, "Come up to יהוה, you and Aharon, Nadav and Avihu and seventy of the elders of Yisra'el, and you shall bow down at a distance.
\v 2 Mosheh alone, however, shall come near to יהוה, but they shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him."
\p
\v 3 And Mosheh came and recounted to the people all the words of יהוה and all the judgments; and all the people answered with one voice and said, "All the words which יהוה has spoken we will do!"
\v 4 Mosheh wrote down all the words of יהוה. And he arose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Yisra'el.
\v 5 He sent young men of the children of Yisra'el, and they slaughtered ascension offerings and slaughtered young bulls as peace offerings to יהוה.
\v 6 Mosheh took half of the blood and put \add it\add* in basins, and the \add other\add* half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
\v 7 And he took the book of the covenant and read \add it\add* in the hearing of the people; and they said, "All that יהוה has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient!"
\v 8 So Mosheh took the blood and sprinkled \add it\add* on the people, and said, "Behold the blood of the covenant, which יהוה has cut with you in accordance with all these words."
\p
\v 9 And Mosheh went up with Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Yisra'el,
\v 10 and they saw the Elohim of Yisra'el; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the heavens itself.
\v 11 Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the children of Yisra'el; and they saw Elohim, and they ate and drank.
\p
\v 12 Now יהוה said to Mosheh, "Come up to Me on the mountain and remain there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the Torah and the command which I have written for their instruction."
\v 13 So Mosheh arose with Yehoshua his servant, and Mosheh went up to the mountain of Elohim.
\v 14 But to the elders he said, "Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aharon and Ḥur are with you; whoever has a legal matter, let him approach them."
\v 15 And Mosheh went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
\v 16 The glory of יהוה rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; and on the seventh day He called to Mosheh from the midst of the cloud.
\v 17 And to the eyes of the children of Yisra'el the appearance of the glory of יהוה was like a consuming fire on the mountain top.
\v 18 Mosheh entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain; and Mosheh was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

\v 6 And behold, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiav, the son of Aḥisamakh, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, so that they shall make all that I have commanded you:
\v 7 the Tent of Appointment, and the ark of witness, and the lid upon it, and all the furniture of the tent,
\v 8 the table also and its utensils, and the pure menorah with all its utensils, and the altar of incense,
\v 9 the altar of ascension offering also with all its utensils, and the basin and its stand,
\v 10 the woven garments as well, and the set-apart garments for Aharon the priest, and the garments of his sons, \add with which\add* to carry on their priesthood;
\v 11 the anointing oil also, and the fragrant incense for the set-apart place, they are to make according to all that I have commanded you."
\p
\v 12 יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 13 "But as for you, speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying, You shall surely guard My Sabbaths; for \add this\add* is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you shall know that I am יהוה who sets you apart.
\v 14 Therefore you are to guard the Sabbath, for it is set-apart to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.
\v 15 For six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day there is a Sabbath of ceasing, set-apart to יהוה; whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.
\v 16 So the children of Yisra'el shall guard the Sabbath,\f + \fr 31:16 \ft DSS add, "to יהוה" here.\f* to celebrate the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.
\v 17 It is a sign between Me and the children of Yisra'el forever; for in six days יהוה made the heavens and the earth, but on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed."
\p
\v 18 When He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave Mosheh the two tablets of the witness, tablets of stone, written by the finger of Elohim.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 And when the people saw that Mosheh delayed to come down from the mountain, the people assembled about Aharon and said to him, "Come, make us an elohim who will go before us; as for this Mosheh, the man who brought us up from the land of Mitsrayim, we do not know what has become of him."
\v 2 Aharon said to them, "Tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring \add them\add* to me."
\v 3 And all the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears and brought \add them\add* to Aharon.
\v 4 He took \add the items\add* from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, "This is your el, O Yisra'el, who brought you up from the land of Mitsrayim."
\v 5 Now when Aharon saw, he built an altar before it; and Aharon made a proclamation and said, "Tomorrow \add shall be\add* a feast to יהוה."
\v 6 So the next day they rose early and offered ascension offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
\p
\v 7 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, "Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Mitsrayim, have corrupted \add themselves\add*.
\v 8 They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and have bowed down to it and have slaughtered to it and said, 'This is your elohim, O Yisra'el, who brought you up from the land of Mitsrayim!'"
\v 9 יהוה said to Mosheh, "I have seen this people, and behold, they are an obstinate people.
\v 10 Now then let Me alone, so that My anger shall burn against them and so that I shall destroy them; and I will make of you a great nation."
\p
\v 11 And Mosheh entreated יהוה his Elohim, and said, "O יהוה, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out from the land of Mitsrayim with great power and with a mighty hand?
\v 12 Why should the Mitsrites speak, saying, 'With evil \add intent\add* He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth'? Turn from Your burning anger and relent \add doing\add* harm to Your people.
\v 13 Remember Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Yisra'el, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, 'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit \add it\add* forever.'"
\v 14 So יהוה relented from the harm which He said He would do to His people.
\p
\v 15 And Mosheh turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the witness in his hand, tablets which were written on both sides; they were written on one \add side\add* and the other.
\v 16 The tablets were the work of Elohim, and the writing was the writing of Elohim, engraved on the tablets.
\v 17 Now when Yehoshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Mosheh, "There is a sound of war in the camp."
\p
\v 18 But he said, "It is not the sound of the cry of triumph, nor is it the sound of the cry of defeat; But the sound of singing I hear."
\p
\v 19 It came about, as soon as Mosheh came near the camp, that he saw the calf and \add the\add* dancing; and Mosheh's anger burned, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.
\v 20 He took the calf which they had made and burned \add it\add* with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it over the surface of the water and made the children of Yisra'el drink \add it\add*.\f + \fr 32:20 \ft According to Bemidbar 5:11-31, a woman suspected of adultery was required to drink "bitter water."\f*
\p
\v 21 And Mosheh said to Aharon, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought \add such\add* great sin upon them?"
\v 22 Aharon said, "Do not let the anger of my master burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil.
\v 23 For they said to me, 'Make an elohim for us who will go before us; for this Mosheh, the man who brought us up from the land of Mitsrayim, we do not know what has become of him.'
\v 24 I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off.' So they gave \add it\add* to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out."
\p
\v 25 Now when Mosheh saw that the people were uncovered-- for Aharon had let them \add become\add* uncovered to their shame among their enemies--
\v 26 then Mosheh stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is for יהוה, \add come\add* to me!" And all the sons of Levi gathered together to him.
\v 27 He said to them, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'Every man \add of you\add* put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp, and kill every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbor.'"
\v 28 So the sons of Levi did as Mosheh instructed, and about three thousand men of the people fell that day.
\v 29 And Mosheh said, "Dedicate yourselves today to יהוה – for every man has been against his son and against his brother – so that He shall bestow a blessing upon you today."
\p
\v 30 On the next day Mosheh said to the people, "You yourselves have committed a great sin; and now I am going up to יהוה, perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
\v 31 And Mosheh returned to יהוה, and said, "Alas, this people has committed a great sin, and they have made an elohim of gold for themselves.
\v 32 But now, if You will, forgive their sin-- and if not, please blot me out from Your book which You have written!"
\v 33 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.
\v 34 But go now, lead the people where I told you. Behold, My messenger shall go before you; nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin."
\v 35 And יהוה struck the people, because of what they did with the calf which Aharon had made.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Mitsrayim, to the land of which I swore to Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya'aqov, saying, 'To your seed I will give it.'
\v 2 I will send a messenger before you and I will drive out the Kena'anite, the Amorite, the Ḥittite, the Perizzite, the Ḥivite and the Yevusite.
\v 3 \add Go up\add* to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, because you are a stiff-necked people, and I might destroy you on the way."
\p
\v 4 When the people heard this disastrous word, they mourned, and none of them put on his ornaments.
\v 5 For יהוה had said to Mosheh, "Say to the children of Yisra'el, 'You are a stiff-necked people; should I go up in your midst for one moment, I would destroy you. Now therefore, put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what I shall do with you.'"
\v 6 So the children of Yisra'el stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Ḥorev \add onward\add*.
\p
\v 7 Now Mosheh used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, a good distance from the camp, and he called it the Tent of Appointment. And everyone who sought יהוה would go out to the Tent of Appointment which was outside the camp.
\v 8 And it came about, whenever Mosheh went out to the tent, that all the people would arise and stand, each at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Mosheh until he entered the tent.
\v 9 Whenever Mosheh entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent; and יהוה would speak with Mosheh.
\v 10 When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would arise and bow down, each at the entrance of his tent.
\v 11 Thus יהוה used to speak to Mosheh face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend. When Mosheh returned to the camp, his servant Yehoshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.
\p
\v 12 And Mosheh said to יהוה, "See, You say to me, 'Bring up this people!' But You Yourself have not let me know whom You will send with me. Moreover, You have said, 'I have known you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.'
\v 13 Now therefore, please, if I have found favor in Your eyes, let me know Your ways that I may know You, so that I may find favor in Your eyes. Consider too, that this nation is Your people."
\v 14 And He said, "My presence shall go \add with you\add*, and I will give you rest."
\v 15 And he said to Him, "If Your presence does not go \add with us\add*, do not lead us up from here.
\v 16 For how then can it be known that I have found favor in Your eyes, I and Your people? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we, I and Your people, should be distinguished from all the \add other\add* people who are upon the face of the earth?"
\p
\v 17 יהוה said to Mosheh, "I will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight and I have known you by name."
\v 18 And Mosheh said, "I pray You, show me Your glory!"
\v 19 And He said, "I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the Name of יהוה before you; and I will favor whom I will favor, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion."
\v 20 But He said, "You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!"
\v 21 And יהוה said, "Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock;
\v 22 and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by.
\v 23 And I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen."
\c 34
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered.
\v 2 So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain.
\v 3 No man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain; even the flocks and the herds may not graze in front of that mountain."
\p
\v 4 So he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones, and Mosheh rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as יהוה had commanded him, and he took two stone tablets in his hand.
\v 5 יהוה descended in the cloud and stood there with him as he called upon the Name of יהוה.
\v 6 And יהוה passed by in front of him and proclaimed, "יהוה, יהוה El, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in loving-kindness and truth;
\v 7 who preserves loving-kindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave \add the guilty\add* unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations."
\v 8 Mosheh hurried to stoop low toward the earth and bow down.
\v 9 He said, "If now I have found favor in Your eyes, O יהוה, please, let יהוה go along in our midst, even though the people are so stiff-necked, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your own possession."
\p
\v 10 And [יהוה] said [to Mosheh],\f + \fr 34:10 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading present in the DSS and LXX. Heb. MT reads, "Then He said" instead.\f* "Behold, I am going to cut a covenant. Before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth nor among any of the nations; and all the people among whom you live will see the working of יהוה, for it is a fearful thing that I am going to perform with you.
\p
\v 11 "Be sure to guard what I am commanding you today: behold, I am going to drive out the Amorite before you, and the Kena'anite, the Ḥittite, the Perizzite, the Ḥivite and the Yevusite.
\v 12 Guard yourself that you cut no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, or it will become a snare in your midst.
\v 13 But \add rather\add*, you are to tear down their altars and smash their pillars and cut down their Asherim--
\v 14 for you shall not bow down to any other elohim, for יהוה, whose Name is Jealous, is a jealous El--
\v 15 otherwise you might cut a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they would whore with their elohim and slaughter to their elohim, and someone might invite you to eat of his sacrifice,
\v 16 and you might take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters might whore with their elohim and cause your sons to whore with their elohim.
\v 17 You shall make for yourself no molten elohim.
\p
\v 18 "You shall guard the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the new moon of the aviv, for in the new moon of the aviv you came out of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 19 "Whatever opens \add the\add* womb\f + \fr 34:19 \ft See footnote at Shemoth 13:2.\f* belongs to Me, and all your male livestock, whatever opens \add the\add* womb from cattle and sheep.
\v 20 You shall redeem with a lamb whatever opens \add the\add* womb from a donkey; and if you do not redeem \add it\add*, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. None shall appear before Me empty-handed.
\p
\v 21 "You shall serve six days, but on the seventh day you shall cease; \add even\add* during plowing time and harvest you shall cease.
\v 22 You shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks, the first fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
\v 23 Three times a year all your males are to appear before Adonai יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 24 For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no man shall covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 25 "You shall not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor is the sacrifice of the Feast of the Pesaḥ to be left over until morning.
\p
\v 26 "You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your soil into the house of יהוה your Elohim. You shall not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."
\p
\v 27 And יהוה said to Mosheh, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have cut a covenant with you and with Yisra'el."
\v 28 So he was there with יהוה forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread or drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Words.
\p
\v 29 It came about when Mosheh was coming down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the witness \add were\add* in Mosheh's hand as he was coming down from the mountain), that Mosheh did not know that the skin of his face shone\f + \fr 34:29 \ft Hebrew word rendered as "shone" here is קרן (qarahn) meaning literally "to have horns" in the sense of horns (or rays of light) jutting out. Also in verses 30 & 35. See also Tehillim 69:31.\f* because of his speaking with Him.
\v 30 So when Aharon and all the children of Yisra'el saw Mosheh, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
\v 31 And Mosheh called to them, and Aharon and all the rulers in the congregation returned to him; and Mosheh spoke to them.
\v 32 Afterward all the children of Yisra'el came near, and he commanded them everything that יהוה had spoken to him on Mount Sinai.
\v 33 When Mosheh had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
\v 34 But whenever Mosheh went in before יהוה to speak with Him, he would take off the veil until he came out; and whenever he came out and spoke to the children of Yisra'el what he had been commanded,
\v 35 the children of Yisra'el would see the face of Mosheh, that the skin of Mosheh's face shone. So Mosheh would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with Him.
\c 35
\ms פרשת ויקהל – Parashat Vayaqhel
\p
\v 1 And Mosheh assembled all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, and said to them, "These are the things that יהוה has commanded \add you\add* to do:
\v 2 For six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a set-apart \add day\add*, a Sabbath of ceasing to יהוה; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.
\v 3 You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day."
\p
\v 4 Mosheh spoke to all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el, saying, "This is the thing which יהוה has commanded, saying,
\v 5 Take from among you a contribution to יהוה; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as a contribution to יהוה: gold, silver, and copper,
\v 6 and blue, purple and scarlet, fine linen, goats' \add hair\add*,
\v 7 and rams' skins dyed red, and taḥash skins, and acacia wood,
\v 8 and oil for lighting, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense,
\v 9 and onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastplate.
\p
\v 10 "Let every wise-hearted \add person\add* among you come, and make all that יהוה has commanded:
\v 11 the Tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its hooks and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
\v 12 the ark and its poles, the lid, and the curtain of the screen;
\v 13 the table and its poles, and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
\v 14 the menorah also for the light and its utensils and its lamps and the oil for the light;
\v 15 and the altar of incense and its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the doorway at the entrance of the Tabernacle;
\v 16 the altar of ascension offering with its copper grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin and its stand;
\v 17 the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;
\v 18 the pegs of the Tabernacle and the pegs of the court and their cords;
\v 19 the woven garments for ministering in the set-apart place, the set-apart garments for Aharon the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.'"
\p
\v 20 And all the congregation of the children of Yisra'el departed from Mosheh's presence.
\v 21 Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came \add and\add* brought to יהוה a contribution for the work of the Tent of Appointment and for all its service and for the set-apart garments.
\v 22 And all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came \add and\add* brought nose rings and earrings and signet rings and bracelets, all articles of gold; so every man who presented an offering of gold to יהוה.
\v 23 Every man, who had in his possession blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats' \add hair\add* and rams' skins dyed red and taḥash skins, brought them.
\v 24 Everyone who could make a contribution of silver and copper brought to יהוה a contribution; and every man who had in his possession acacia wood for any work of the service brought it.
\v 25 All the wise-hearted women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun: blue and purple, scarlet \add material\add* and fine linen.
\v 26 All the women whose heart stirred with wisdom spun the goats' \add hair\add*.
\v 27 The rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastplate;
\v 28 and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.
\v 29 The Yisra'elites, all the men and women, whose heart moved them to bring \add materials\add* for all the work, which יהוה had commanded through Mosheh to be done, brought a freewill offering to יהוה.
\p
\v 30 And Mosheh said to the children of Yisra'el, "See, יהוה has called by name Betsal'el the son of Uri, the son of Ḥur, of the tribe of Yehudah.
\v 31 And He has filled him with the Ruaḥ of Elohim, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship;
\v 32 to make designs for working in gold and in silver and in copper,
\v 33 and in the cutting of stones for settings and in the carving of wood, so as to perform in every inventive work.
\v 34 He also has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiav, the son of Aḥisamakh, of the tribe of Dan.
\v 35 He has filled them with \add a\add* wise heart to perform every work of an engraver and of a designer and of an embroiderer, in blue and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of a weaver, as performers of every work and makers of designs."
\c 36
\p
\v 1 "And Betsal'el and Oholiav, and every wise-hearted man in whom יהוה has put wisdom and understanding to know how to perform all the work in the service of the set-apart place, shall perform in accordance with all that יהוה has commanded."
\p
\v 2 And Mosheh called Betsal'el and Oholiav and every wise-hearted man in whom יהוה had put wisdom, everyone whose heart stirred him, to come to the work to perform it.
\v 3 They received from Mosheh all the contributions which the children of Yisra'el had brought to perform the work in the service of the set-apart place. And they still \add continued\add* bringing to him freewill offerings every morning.
\v 4 And all the skillful men who were performing all the work of the set-apart place came, each from the work which he was performing,
\v 5 and they said to Mosheh, "The people are bringing much more than enough for the service of work which יהוה commanded \add us\add* to perform."
\v 6 So Mosheh issued a command, and a proclamation was circulated throughout the camp, saying, "Let no man or woman any longer perform work for the contributions of the set-apart place." Thus the people were restrained from bringing \add any more\add*.
\v 7 For the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work, to perform it.
\p
\v 8 All the wise-hearted men among those who were performing the work made the Tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet, with keruvim, the work of a skillful workman, Betsal'el made them.
\v 9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had the same measurements.
\v 10 He joined five curtains to one another and \add the other\add* five curtains he joined to one another.
\v 11 He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; he did likewise on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set.
\v 12 He made fifty loops in the one curtain and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite each other.
\v 13 He made fifty clasps of gold and joined the curtains to one another with the clasps, so the Tabernacle was a unit.
\p
\v 14 And he made curtains of goats' \add hair\add* for a tent over the Tabernacle; he made eleven curtains in all.
\v 15 The length of each curtain \add was\add* thirty cubits and four cubits the width of each curtain; the eleven curtains had the same measurements.
\v 16 He joined five curtains by themselves and \add the other\add* six curtains by themselves.
\v 17 Moreover, he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the \add first\add* set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain \add that was outermost in\add* the second set.
\v 18 He made fifty clasps of copper to join the tent together so that it would be a unit.
\v 19 He made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of taḥash skins above.
\p
\v 20 And he made the boards for the Tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright.
\v 21 Ten cubits \add was\add* the length of each board and one and a half cubits the width of each board.
\v 22 \add There were two\add* tenons for each board, fitted to one another; thus he did for all the boards of the Tabernacle.
\v 23 He made the boards for the Tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side;
\v 24 and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
\v 25 And for the second side of the Tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,
\v 26 and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board.
\v 27 For the rear of the Tabernacle, to the west, he made six boards.
\v 28 He made two boards for the corners of the Tabernacle at the rear.
\v 29 They were double beneath, and together they were complete to its top to the first ring; thus he did with both of them for the two corners.
\v 30 There were eight boards with their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two under every board.
\p
\v 31 And he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of one side of the Tabernacle,
\v 32 and five bars for the boards of the other side of the Tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the Tabernacle for the rear \add side\add* to the west.
\v 33 He made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end.
\v 34 He overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold \add as\add* holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
\p
\v 35 Moreover, he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet, and fine twisted linen; he made it with keruvim, the work of a skillful workman.
\v 36 He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them.
\v 37 He made a screen for the doorway of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet, and fine twisted linen, the work of a weaver;
\v 38 and \add he made\add* its five pillars with their hooks, and he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold; but their five sockets were of copper.
\c 37
\p
\v 1 Now Betsal'el made the ark of acacia wood; its length was two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits;
\v 2 and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a gold molding for it all around.
\v 3 He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet; even two rings on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
\v 4 He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
\v 5 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry it.
\v 6 He made a lid of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.
\v 7 He made two keruvim of gold; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the lid;
\v 8 one keruv at the one end and one keruv at the other end; he made the keruvim \add of one piece\add* with the lid at the two ends.
\v 9 The keruvim had \add their\add* wings spread upward, covering the lid with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the keruvim were toward the lid.
\v 10 And he made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long and a cubit wide and one and a half cubits high.
\p
\v 11 He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding for it all around.
\v 12 He made a rim for it of a handbreadth all around, and made a gold molding for its rim all around.
\v 13 He cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet.
\v 14 Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles to carry the table.
\v 15 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.
\v 16 He made the utensils which were on the table, its dishes and its pans and its bowls and its jars, with which to pour out drink offerings, of pure gold.
\p
\v 17 And he made the menorah of pure gold. He made the menorah of hammered work, its base and its shaft; its cups, its bulbs and its flowers were \add of one piece\add* with it.
\v 18 There were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the menorah from the one side of it and three branches of the menorah from the other side of it;
\v 19 three cups shaped like almond \add blossoms\add*, a bulb and a flower in one branch, and three cups shaped like almond \add blossoms\add*, a bulb and a flower in the other branch-- so for the six branches going out of the menorah.
\v 20 In the menorah \add there were\add* four cups shaped like almond \add blossoms\add*, its bulbs and its flowers;
\v 21 and a bulb was under the \add first\add* pair of branches \add coming\add* out of it, and a bulb under the \add second\add* pair of branches \add coming\add* out of it, and a bulb under the \add third\add* pair of branches \add coming\add* out of it, for the six branches coming out of the menorah.
\v 22 Their bulbs and their branches were \add of one piece\add* with it; the whole of it \add was\add* a single hammered work of pure gold.
\v 23 He made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold.
\v 24 He made it and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.
\p
\v 25 And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit long and a cubit wide, square, and two cubits high; its horns were \add of one piece\add* with it.
\v 26 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and he made a gold molding for it all around.
\v 27 He made two golden rings for it under its molding, on its two sides-- on opposite sides-- as holders for poles with which to carry it.
\v 28 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
\v 29 And he made the set-apart anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 And he made the altar of ascension offering of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, square, and three cubits high.
\v 2 He made its horns on its four corners, its horns being of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with copper.
\v 3 He made all the utensils of the altar, the pails and the shovels and the basins, the flesh hooks and the firepans; he made all its utensils of copper.
\v 4 He made for the altar a grating of copper network beneath, under its ledge, reaching halfway up.
\v 5 He cast four rings on the four ends of the copper grating as holders for the poles.
\v 6 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with copper.
\v 7 He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks.
\p
\v 8 Moreover, he made the basin of copper with its base of copper, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the Tent of Appointment.
\p
\v 9 And he made the court: for the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits;
\v 10 their twenty pillars, and their twenty sockets, made of copper; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
\v 11 For the north side there were one hundred cubits; their twenty pillars and their twenty sockets were of copper, the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.

\v 15 and so for the other side. On both sides of the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets.
\v 16 All the hangings of the court all around were of fine twisted linen.
\v 17 The sockets for the pillars were of copper, the hooks of the pillars and their bands, of silver; and the overlaying of their tops, of silver, and all the pillars of the court were furnished with silver bands.
\v 18 The screen of the gate of the court was the work of the weaver, of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twisted linen. And the length was twenty cubits and the height was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the court.
\v 19 Their four pillars and their four sockets were of copper; their hooks were of silver, and the overlaying of their tops and their bands were of silver.

\ms פרשת פקודי – Parashat Pequdei
\v 21 This is the number of the things for the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the witness, as they were numbered according to the command of Mosheh, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aharon the priest.
\v 22 Now Betsal'el the son of Uri, the son of Ḥur, of the tribe of Yehudah, made all that יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 23 With him was Oholiav the son of Aḥisamakh, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful workman and a weaver in blue and in purple and in scarlet, and fine linen.
\p
\v 24 All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the set-apart place, even the gold of the wave offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven-hundred and thirty sheqels, according to the sheqel of the set-apart place.
\v 25 The silver of those of the congregation who were numbered was one-hundred talents and one-thousand seven-hundred seventy-five sheqels, according to the sheqel of the set-apart place;
\v 26 a beka a head (that is, half a sheqel according to the sheqel of the set-apart place), for each one who passed over to those who were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six-hundred and three-thousand five-hundred and fifty men.
\p
\v 27 The hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the set-apart place and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
\v 28 Of the one-thousand seven-hundred seventy-five sheqels, he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and made bands for them.
\v 29 The copper of the wave offering was seventy talents and two-thousand and four-hundred sheqels.
\v 30 With it he made the sockets to the doorway of the Tent of Appointment, and the copper altar and its copper grating, and all the utensils of the altar,
\v 31 and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pegs of the Tabernacle and all the pegs of the court all around.
\c 39
\p
\v 1 Moreover, from the blue and purple and scarlet, they made finely woven garments for ministering in the set-apart place as well as the set-apart garments which were for Aharon, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 2 He made the ephod of gold, of blue and purple and scarlet, and fine twisted linen.
\v 3 And they hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads to be woven in with the blue and the purple and the scarlet, and the fine linen, the work of a skillful workman.
\v 4 They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod; it was attached at its two upper ends.
\v 5 The skillfully woven band which was on it was like its workmanship, of the same material: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet, and fine twisted linen, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 6 They made the onyx stones, set in gold filigree settings; they were engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 7 And he placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, as memorial stones for the children of Yisra'el, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 8 He made the breastplate, the work of a skillful workman, like the workmanship of the ephod: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twisted linen.
\v 9 It was square; they made the breastplate folded double, a span long and a span wide when folded double.
\v 10 And they mounted four rows of stones on it. The first row was a row of ruby, topaz, and emerald;
\v 11 and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond;
\v 12 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
\v 13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were set in gold filigree settings when they were mounted.
\v 14 The stones were corresponding to the names of the children of Yisra'el; they were twelve, corresponding to their names, engraved with the engravings of a signet, each with its name for the twelve tribes.
\p
\v 15 They made on the breastplate chains like cords, of twisted cordage work in pure gold.
\v 16 They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
\v 17 And they put the two gold cords in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.
\v 18 They put the other two ends of the two cords on the two filigree settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it.
\v 19 They made two gold rings and placed them on the two ends of the breastplate, on its inner edge which was next to the ephod.
\v 20 Furthermore, they made two gold rings and placed them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to the place where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod.
\v 21 They bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod [as יהוה commanded Mosheh] with a blue cord, so that it would be on the woven band [on the inside] of the ephod, and that the breastplate would not come loose from the ephod, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh. [He also made the Urim and Thimmim as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.]
\p
\v 22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue;
\v 23 and the opening of the robe was at the top in the center, as the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding all around its opening, so that it would not be torn.
\v 24 They made pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet and twisted linen on the hem of the robe.
\v 25 They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the hem of the robe,
\v 26 alternating a bell and a pomegranate all around on the hem of the robe for the service, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 27 They made the tunics of finely woven linen for Aharon and his sons,
\v 28 and the turban of fine linen, and the decorated caps of fine linen, and the linen undergarments of fine twisted linen,
\v 29 and the sash of fine twisted linen, and blue and purple and scarlet, the work of the weaver, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 30 They made the plate of the set-apart crown of pure gold, and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet, "Set-apart to יהוה."
\v 31 They fastened a blue cord to it, to fasten it on the turban above, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 32 Thus all the service of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Appointment was completed; and the children of Yisra'el did according to all that יהוה had commanded Mosheh; so they did.
\v 33 They brought the Tabernacle to Mosheh, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars and its sockets;
\v 34 and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of taḥash skins, and the screening veil;
\v 35 the ark of the witness and its poles and the lid;
\v 36 the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
\v 37 the pure menorah, with its arrangement of lamps and all its utensils, and the oil for the light;
\v 38 and the gold altar, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the veil for the doorway of the tent;
\v 39 the copper altar and its copper grating, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its stand;
\v 40 the hangings for the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, its cords and its pegs and all the equipment for the service of the Tabernacle, for the Tent of Appointment;
\v 41 the woven garments for ministering in the set-apart place and the set-apart garments for Aharon the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.
\p
\v 42 So the children of Yisra'el did all the service according to all that יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 43 And Mosheh examined all the work and behold, they had done it; just as יהוה had commanded, this they had done. So Mosheh blessed them.
\c 40
\p
\v 1 And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
\v 2 "On the first day of the first new moon you shall set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 3 You shall place the ark of the witness there, and you shall screen the ark with the veil.
\v 4 You shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it; and you shall bring in the menorah and mount its lamps.
\v 5 Moreover, you shall set the gold altar of incense before the ark of the witness, and set up the veil for the doorway to the Tabernacle.
\v 6 You shall set the altar of ascension offering in front of the doorway of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 7 You shall set the basin between the Tent of Appointment and the altar and put water in it.
\v 8 You shall set up the court all around and hang up the veil for the gateway of the court.
\p
\v 9 "And you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle and all that is in it, and shall set it apart, and all its furnishings; and it shall be set-apart.
\v 10 You shall anoint the altar of ascension offering and all its utensils, and set the altar apart, and the altar shall be most set-apart.
\v 11 You shall anoint the basin and its stand, and set it apart.
\v 12 And you shall bring Aharon and his sons to the doorway of the Tent of Appointment and wash them with water.
\v 13 You shall put the set-apart garments on Aharon and anoint him and set him apart, that he may minister as a priest to Me.
\v 14 You shall bring his sons and put tunics on them;
\v 15 and you shall anoint them even as you have anointed their father, that they may minister as priests to Me; and their anointing will qualify them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations."
\v 16 Thus Mosheh did; according to all that יהוה had commanded him, so he did.
\p
\v 17 Now in the first new moon of the second year, on the first day of the new moon, the Tabernacle was erected.
\v 18 Mosheh erected the Tabernacle and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and inserted its bars and erected its pillars.
\v 19 He spread the tent over the Tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 20 And he took the witness and put it into the ark, and attached the poles to the ark, and put the lid on top of the ark.
\v 21 He brought the ark into the Tabernacle, and set up a veil for the screen, and screened off the ark of the witness, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 22 And he put the table in the Tent of Appointment on the north side of the Tabernacle, outside the veil.
\v 23 He set the arrangement of bread in order on it before יהוה, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 24 And he placed the menorah in the Tent of Appointment, opposite the table, on the south side of the Tabernacle.
\v 25 He lighted the lamps before יהוה, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 26 And he placed the gold altar in the Tent of Appointment in front of the veil;
\v 27 and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 28 And he set up the veil for the doorway of the Tabernacle.
\v 29 He set the altar of ascension offering before the doorway of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Appointment, and offered on it the ascension offering and the meal offering, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 30 He placed the basin between the Tent of Appointment and the altar and put water in it for washing.
\v 31 From it Mosheh and Aharon and his sons washed their hands and their feet.
\p
\v 32 When they entered the Tent of Appointment, and when they approached the altar, they washed, just as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
\v 33 He erected the court all around the Tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the veil for the gateway of the court. Thus Mosheh finished the work.
\p
\v 34 And the cloud covered the Tent of Appointment, and the glory of יהוה filled the Tabernacle.
\v 35 Mosheh was not able to enter the Tent of Appointment because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of יהוה filled the Tabernacle.
\v 36 Throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle, the children of Yisra'el would set out;
\v 37 but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day when it was taken up.
\v 38 For throughout all their journeys, the cloud of יהוה was on the Tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Yisra'el.
