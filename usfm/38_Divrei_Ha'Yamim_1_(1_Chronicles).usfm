\v 11 The sons of Gad lived over against them, in the land of Bashan to Salekah:
\v 12 Yo'el the chief, Shapham the second, Yanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.
\v 13 Their brothers of their fathers' houses: Mikha'el, Meshullam, Sheva, Yorai, Yakan, Zia, and Ever, seven.

\v 19 They made war with the Hagrites, with Yetur, and Naphish, and Nodav.
\v 20 They were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who were with them; for they cried to Elohim in the battle, and He answered them, because they relied on Him.
\v 21 They took away their livestock; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred fifty thousand, and of donkeys two thousand, and the beings of men one hundred thousand.
\v 22 For many fell slain, because the war was of Elohim. They lived in their place until the captivity.
\v 23 The children of the half-tribe of Menasheh lived in the land: they increased from Bashan to Ba'al Ḥermon, Senir, and Mount Ḥermon.
\v 24 These were the heads of their fathers' houses: even Epher, Yishi, Eli'el, Azri'el, Yirmeyah, Hodavyah, and Yaḥdi'el, mighty men of valor, famous men, heads of their fathers' houses.
\v 25 They trespassed against the Elohim of their fathers, and whored after the elohim of the peoples of the land, whom Elohim destroyed before them.
\v 26 So the Elohim of Yisra'el stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Ashuwr, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser king of Ashuwr, and he carried them away, even the Reuvenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Menasheh, and brought them to Ḥalah, Ḥavor, Hara, and to the river of Gozan, to this day.

\p
\v 1 So all Yisra'el were listed by genealogies; and behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Yisra'el. Yehudah was carried away captive to Bavel for their disobedience.
\v 2 Now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were Yisra'el, the priests, the Levites, and the Temple servants.
\v 3 In Yerushalayim lived of the children of Yehudah, of the children of Benyamin, and of the children of Ephrayim and Menasheh:
\v 4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perets the son of Yehudah.

\p
\v 17 The gatekeepers: Shallum, Aquv, Talmon, Aḥiman, and their brothers (Shallum was the chief),
\v 18 who previously served in the king's gate eastward. They were the gatekeepers for the camp of the children of Levi.
\v 19 Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Evyasaph, the son of Qoraḥ, and his brothers, of his father's house, the Qoraḥites, were over the work of the service, guards of the thresholds of the tent. Their fathers had been over the camp of יהוה, guards of the entry.
\p
\v 20 Pineḥas the son of Elazar was ruler over them in time past, and יהוה was with him.
\v 21 Zekharyah the son of Meshelemyah was gatekeeper of the door of the Tent of Appointment.
\v 22 All these who were chosen to be gatekeepers in the thresholds were two hundred twelve. These were listed by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Shemu'el the seer ordained in their office of faithfulness.
\v 23 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of יהוה, even the house of the tent, by wards.
\v 24 On the four sides were the gatekeepers, toward the east, west, north, and south.
\v 25 Their brothers, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them:
\v 26 for the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were in an office of faithfulness, and were over the rooms and over the treasuries in the house of Elohim.
\v 27 They stayed around the house of Elohim, because that duty was on them; and to their duty was its opening morning by morning.
\p
\v 28 Certain of them were in charge of the vessels of service; for these were brought in by count, and these were taken out by count.
\v 29 Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the set-apart place, over the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the frankincense, and the spices.
\p
\v 30 Some of the sons of the priests prepared the mixing of the spices.
\v 31 Mattithyah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Qoraḥite, had the faithful office over the things that were baked in pans.
\v 32 Some of their brothers, of the sons of the Qohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every Sabbath.
\v 33 These are the singers, heads of fathers' households of the Levites, who lived in the rooms and were free from other service; for they were employed in their work day and night.
\v 34 These were heads of fathers' households of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief men. These lived at Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 35 Yei'el the father of Givon, whose wife's name was Ma'akah, lived in Givon with

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines fought against Yisra'el, and the men of Yisra'el fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.
\v 2 The Philistines followed hard after Sha'ul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Yonathan, Avinadav, and Malkishua, the sons of Sha'ul.
\v 3 The battle went hard against Sha'ul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.
\v 4 Then Sha'ul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me." But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Sha'ul took his sword, and fell on it.
\v 5 When his armor bearer saw that Sha'ul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died.
\v 6 So Sha'ul died with his three sons; and all his house died together.
\v 7 When all the men of Yisra'el who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Sha'ul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
\p
\v 8 On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Sha'ul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
\v 9 They stripped him, and took his head and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to their idols, and to the people.
\v 10 They put his armor in the house of their elohim, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.
\v 11 When all Yavesh Gilad heard all that the Philistines had done to Sha'ul,
\v 12 all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Sha'ul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Yavesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Yavesh, and fasted seven days.
\v 13 So Sha'ul died for his trespass which he committed against יהוה, because of the word of יהוה, which he did not guard; and also because he asked counsel of a medium, to inquire,
\v 14 and did not inquire of יהוה. Therefore He killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Yishai.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then all Yisra'el gathered themselves to David to Ḥevron, saying, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\v 2 In times past, even when Sha'ul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Yisra'el. יהוה your Elohim said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of My people Yisra'el, and you shall be prince over My people Yisra'el.'"
\p
\v 3 So all the elders of Yisra'el came to the king to Ḥevron; and David cut a covenant with them in Ḥevron before יהוה; and they anointed David king over Yisra'el, according to the word of יהוה by Shemu'el.
\v 4 David and all Yisra'el went to Yerushalayim (also called Yevus); and the Yevusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
\v 5 The inhabitants of Yevus said to David, "You will not come in here." Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Tsion. The same is the city of David.
\v 6 David said, "Whoever strikes the Yevusites first shall be chief and captain." Yoav the son of Tseruyah went up first, and was made chief.
\v 7 David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.
\v 8 He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Yoav repaired the rest of the city.
\v 9 David grew greater and greater; for יהוה Tsevaot was with him.
\v 10 Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Yisra'el, to make him king, according to the word of יהוה concerning Yisra'el.
\p
\v 11 This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Yashovam, the son of a Ḥakmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.
\v 12 After him was Elazar the son of Dodo, the Aḥoḥite, who was one of the three mighty men.
\v 13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
\v 14 They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and יהוה saved them by a great victory.
\v 15 Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 16 David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Beth-leḥem at that time.
\v 17 David longed, and said, "Oh that one would give me water to drink from the well of Beth-leḥem, which is by the gate!"
\p
\v 18 The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-leḥem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured it out to יהוה,
\v 19 and said, "My Elohim forbid me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their beings in jeopardy?" For they risked their beings to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.
\p
\v 20 Avishai, the brother of Yoav, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.
\v 21 Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain; however he was not included in the three.
\v 22 Benayah the son of Yehoyada, the son of a valiant man of Qavtse'el, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ari'el of Moav. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day.
\v 23 He killed a Mitsrite, a man of great stature, five cubits high. In the Mitsrite's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, plucked the spear out of the Mitsrite's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
\v 24 Benayah the son of Yehoyada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.
\v 25 Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he did not attain to the three; and David set him over his guard.
\p
\v 26 The mighty men of the armies also include Asah'el the brother of Yoav, Elḥanan the son of Dodo of Beth-leḥem,
\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Ḥelets the Pelonite,
\v 28 Ira the son of Iqqesh the Tekoite, Aviezer the Anathothite,

\p
\v 1 Now these are those who came to David to Tsiqlag, while he was a fugitive from Sha'ul the son of Qish. They were among the mighty men, his helpers in war.
\v 2 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow. They were of Sha'ul's relatives of the tribe of Benyamin.
\v 3 The chief was Aḥiezer, then Yoash, the sons of Shema'ah the Givathite; Yezi'el and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Berakah; Yehu the Anathothite;
\v 4 Yishmayah the Givonite, a mighty man among the thirty and a leader of the thirty; Yiremyah; Yaḥazi'el; Yoḥanan; Yozavad the Gederathite;
\v 5 Eluzai; Yerimoth; Bealyah; Shemaryah; Shephatyah the Ḥaruphite;
\v 6 Elqanah, Yishshiyahu Azar'el, Yoezer, and Yashovam, the Qoraḥites;
\v 7 and Yo'elah and Zevadyah, the sons of Yeroḥam of Gedor.
\v 8 Some Gadites joined David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains:
\v 9 Ezer the chief, Ovadyah the second, Eliav the third,
\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Yiremyah the fifth,
\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eli'el the seventh,
\v 12 Yoḥanan the eighth, Elzavad the ninth,
\v 13 Yirmeyah the tenth, and Makhbannai the eleventh.
\v 14 These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army: he who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to one thousand.
\v 15 These are those who went over the Yarden in the first new moon, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all who lived in the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west.
\p
\v 16 Some of the children of Benyamin and Yehudah came to the stronghold to David.
\v 17 David went out to meet them, and answered them, "If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the Elohim of our fathers see this and rebuke it."
\v 18 Then the Ruaḥ came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, "We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Yishai. Peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your Elohim helps you." Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
\v 19 Some of Menasheh also joined David, when he came with the Philistines against Sha'ul to battle; but they did not help them; for the princes of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, "He will desert to his master Sha'ul to the jeopardy of our heads."
\p
\v 20 As he went to Tsiqlag, some from Menasheh joined him: Adnah, Yozavad, Yediya'el, Mikha'el, Yozavad, Elihu, and Tsillethai, captains of thousands who were of Menasheh.
\v 21 They helped David against the band of rovers; for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army.
\v 22 For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of Elohim.
\p
\v 23 These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Ḥevron, to turn the kingdom of Sha'ul to him, according to the word of יהוה.
\p
\v 24 The children of Yehudah who bore shield and spear were six thousand eight hundred, armed for war.
\p
\v 25 Of the children of Shimon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand one hundred.
\p
\v 26 Of the children of Levi four thousand six hundred.
\v 27 Yehoyada was the leader of the household of Aharon; and with him were three thousand seven hundred,
\v 28 and Tsadoq, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty-two captains.
\p
\v 29 Of the children of Benyamin, Sha'ul's relatives, three thousand: for until then, the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to Sha'ul's house.
\p
\v 30 Of the children of Ephrayim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers' houses.
\p
\v 31 Of the half-tribe of Menasheh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king.
\p
\v 32 Of the children of Yissakhar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Yisra'el ought to do, their heads were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their command.
\p
\v 33 Of Zevulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all kinds of instruments of war, fifty thousand, and who could command and were not of double heart.
\p
\v 34 Of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.
\p
\v 35 Of the Danites who could set the battle in array, twenty-eight thousand six hundred.
\p
\v 36 Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand.
\p
\v 37 On the other side of the Yarden, of the Reuvenites, the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Menasheh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle, one hundred twenty thousand.
\v 38 All these were men of war, who could order the battle array, and came with a perfect heart to Ḥevron, to make David king over all Yisra'el; and all the rest also of Yisra'el were of one heart to make David king.
\v 39 They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had supplied provisions for them.
\p
\v 40 Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Yissakhar, Zevulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, on camels, on mules, and on oxen: supplies of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Yisra'el.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.
\v 2 David said to all the assembly of Yisra'el, "If it seems good in your eyes, and if it is of יהוה our Elohim, let us send word everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Yisra'el, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us.
\v 3 Also, let us again bring the ark of our Elohim back to us; for we did not seek it in the days of Sha'ul."
\p
\v 4 All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\v 5 So David assembled all Yisra'el together, from the Shiḥor the brook of Mitsrayim even to the entrance of Ḥamath, to bring the ark of Elohim from Qiryath Yearim.
\p
\v 6 David went up with all Yisra'el to Ba'alah, that is, to Qiryath Yearim, which belonged to Yehudah, to bring up from there the ark of Elohim יהוה that sits above the keruvim, that is called by the Name.
\v 7 They carried the ark of Elohim on a new cart, and brought it out of Avinadav's house; and Uzza and Aḥyo drove the cart.
\v 8 David and all Yisra'el played before Elohim with all their might, even with songs, with harps, with stringed instruments, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets.
\v 9 When they came to Kidon's threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
\v 10 The anger of יהוה burned against Uzza, and He struck him, because he put his hand on the ark; and he died there before Elohim.
\v 11 David was displeased, because יהוה had broken out against Uzza. He called that place Perets Uzza, to this day.
\v 12 David was afraid of Elohim that day, saying, "How can I bring the ark of Elohim home to me?"
\v 13 So David did not move the ark with him into the city of David, but carried it aside into Oved-Edom the Gittite's house.
\v 14 The ark of Elohim remained with the family of Oved-Edom in his house three new moons; and יהוה blessed Oved-Edom's house and all that he had.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Ḥiram king of Tsor sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.
\v 2 David perceived that יהוה had established him king over Yisra'el; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for His people Yisra'el's sake.
\v 3 David took more wives at Yerushalayim, and David brought forth more sons and daughters.
\v 4 These are the names of the children whom he had in Yerushalayim: Shammua, Shovav, Nathan, Shelomoh,
\v 5 Yivḥar, Elishua, Elpelet,
\v 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Yaphia,
\v 7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
\p
\v 8 When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Yisra'el, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out against them.
\v 9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 10 David inquired of Elohim, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?" יהוה said to him, "Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand."
\p
\v 11 So they came up to Ba'al Peratsim, and David defeated them there. David said, "Elohim has broken my enemies by my hand, like waters breaking out." Therefore they called the name of that place Ba'al Peratsim.
\v 12 They left their elohim there; and David gave a command, and they were burned with fire.
\p
\v 13 The Philistines made another raid in the valley.
\v 14 David inquired again of Elohim; and Elohim said to him, "You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them opposite the mulberry trees.
\v 15 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle; for Elohim has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines."
\p
\v 16 David did as Elohim commanded him; and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Givon even to Gezer.
\v 17 The fame of David went out into all lands; and יהוה brought the fear of him on all nations.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 David made himself houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of Elohim, and pitched a tent for it.
\v 2 Then David said, "No one ought to carry the ark of Elohim but the Levites. For יהוה has chosen them to carry the ark of Elohim, and to minister to Him forever."
\p
\v 3 David assembled all Yisra'el at Yerushalayim, to bring up the ark of יהוה to its place, which he had prepared for it.
\v 4 David gathered together the sons of Aharon and the Levites:
\v 5 of the sons of Qohath, Uri'el the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty;
\v 6 of the sons of Merari, Asayah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty;
\v 7 of the sons of Gershom, Yo'el the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty;
\v 8 of the sons of Elitsaphan, Shemayah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;
\v 9 of the sons of Ḥevron, Eli'el the chief, and his brothers eighty;
\v 10 of the sons of Uzzi'el, Amminadav the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.
\v 11 David called for Tsadoq and Evyathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uri'el, Asayah, Yo'el, Shemayah, Eli'el, and Amminadav,
\v 12 and said to them, "You are the heads of the fathers' households of the Levites. Set yourselves apart, both you and your brothers, that you may bring the ark of יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, up to the place that I have prepared for it.
\v 13 For because you did not carry it at first, יהוה our Elohim broke out in anger against us, because we did not seek Him according to the judgment."
\p
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites set themselves apart to bring up the ark of יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 15 The children of the Levites bore the ark of Elohim on their shoulders with its poles, as Mosheh commanded according to the word of יהוה.
\v 16 David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up their voices with joy.
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Yo'el; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berekhyahu; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Qushayahu;
\v 18 and with them their brothers of the second rank, Zekharyah, Ben, Ya'azi'el, Shemiramoth, Yeḥi'el, Unni, Eliav, Benayahu, Ma'aseyahu, Mattithyahu, Eliphelehu, Miqneyahu, Oved-Edom, and Yei'el, the doorkeepers.
\v 19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of copper to sound aloud;
\v 20 and Zekharyahu, Azi'el, Shemiramoth, Yeḥi'el, Unni, Eliav, Ma'aseyahu, and Benayahu, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;
\v 21 and Mattithyahu, Eliphelehu, Miqneyahu, Oved-Edom, Yei'el, and Azazyahu, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead.
\v 22 Kenanyahu, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He disciplined the singers, because he was skillful.
\v 23 Berekhyah and Elqanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
\v 24 Shevanyah, Yoshaphat, Nethan'el, Amasai, Zekharyahu, Benayahu, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of Elohim; and Oved-Edom and Yeḥiyah were doorkeepers for the ark.
\p
\v 25 So David, the elders of Yisra'el, and the captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of the covenant of יהוה up out of the house of Oved-Edom with joy.
\v 26 When Elohim helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה, they slaughtered seven bulls and seven rams.
\v 27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Kenanyah the choir master with the singers; and David had an ephod of linen on him.
\v 28 Thus all Yisra'el brought the ark of the covenant of יהוה up with shouting, with the voice of the shofar, with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps.
\v 29 As the ark of the covenant of יהוה came to the city of David, Mikhal the daughter of Sha'ul looked out at the window, and saw King David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 They brought in the ark of Elohim, and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered ascension offerings and peace offerings before Elohim.
\v 2 When David had finished offering the ascension offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the Name of יהוה.
\v 3 He gave to everyone of Yisra'el, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.
\v 4 He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of יהוה, and to commemorate, to thank, and to praise יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el:
\v 5 Asaph the chief, and second to him Zekharyah, then Yei'el, Shemiramoth, Yeḥi'el, Mattithyah, Eliav, Benayahu, Oved-Edom, and Yei'el, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;
\v 6 with Benayahu and Yaḥazi'el the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of Elohim.
\p
\v 7 Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to יהוה, by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.
\p
\v 8 Oh give thanks to יהוה. Call on His Name. Make known among the peoples what He has done.
\v 9 Sing to Him. Sing praises to Him. Tell of all His marvelous works.
\v 10 Glory in His set-apart Name. Let the heart of those who seek יהוה rejoice.
\v 11 Seek יהוה and His strength. Seek His face forever more.
\v 12 Remember His marvelous works that He has done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,
\v 13 you seed of Yisra'el His servant, you children of Ya'aqov, His chosen ones.
\v 14 He is יהוה our Elohim. His judgments are in all the earth.
\v 15 Remember His covenant forever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
\v 16 the covenant which He cut with Avraham, His oath to Yitsḥaq.
\v 17 He confirmed the same to Ya'aqov for a statute, and to Yisra'el for an everlasting covenant,
\v 18 saying, "I will give you the land of Kena'an, the lot of your inheritance,"
\v 19 when you were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners were in it.
\v 20 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.
\v 21 He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yes, He reproved kings for their sakes,
\v 22 "Do not touch My anointed ones! Do My prophets no harm!"
\v 23 Sing to יהוה, all the earth! Display His salvation from day to day.
\v 24 Declare His glory among the nations, and His marvelous works among all the peoples.
\v 25 For great is יהוה, and greatly to be praised. He also is to be feared above all elohim.
\v 26 For all the elohim of the peoples are idols, but יהוה made the heavens.
\v 27 Honor and majesty are before Him. Strength and gladness are in His place.
\v 28 Ascribe to יהוה, you relatives of the peoples, ascribe to יהוה glory and strength!
\v 29 Ascribe to יהוה the glory due to His Name. Bring an offering, and come before Him. Bow down to יהוה in set-apart array.
\v 30 Tremble before Him, all the earth. The world also is established that it cannot be moved.
\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice! Let them say among the nations, "יהוה reigns!"
\v 32 Let the sea roar, and its fullness! Let the field exult, and all that is in it!
\v 33 Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before יהוה, for He comes to judge the earth.
\v 34 Oh give thanks to יהוה, for He is good, for His loving-kindness endures forever.
\v 35 Say, "Save us, Elohim of our salvation! Gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to Your set-apart Name, to triumph in Your praise."
\v 36 Blessed be יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, from everlasting even to everlasting. All the people said, "Amein," and praised יהוה.
\p
\v 37 So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of יהוה, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;
\v 38 and Oved-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Oved-Edom also the son of Yeduthun and Ḥosah to be doorkeepers;
\v 39 and Tsadoq the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the Tabernacle of יהוה in the high place that was at Givon,
\v 40 to offer ascension offerings to יהוה on the altar of ascension offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the Torah of יהוה, which He commanded to Yisra'el;
\v 41 and with them Heman and Yeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to יהוה, because His loving-kindness endures forever;
\v 42 and with them Heman and Yeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of Elohim; and the sons of Yeduthun to be at the gate.
\v 43 All the people departed, each man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 When David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, "Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of יהוה is in a tent."
\p
\v 2 Nathan said to David, "Do all that is in your heart; for Elohim is with you."
\p
\v 3 That same night, the word of Elohim came to Nathan, saying,
\v 4 "Go and tell David My servant, 'יהוה says, "You shall not build Me a house to dwell in;
\v 5 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Yisra'el to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another.
\v 6 In all places in which I have walked with all Yisra'el, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Yisra'el, whom I commanded to be shepherd of My people, saying, 'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?'"'
\p
\v 7 "Now therefore, you shall tell My servant David, 'יהוה Tsevaot says, "I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over My people Yisra'el.
\v 8 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
\v 9 I will appoint a place for My people Yisra'el, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of unrighteousness will not waste them any more, as at the first,
\v 10 and from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Yisra'el. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that יהוה will build you a house.
\v 11 It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
\v 12 He will build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.
\v 13 I will be his father, and he will be My son. I will not take My loving-kindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;
\v 14 but I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom forever. His throne will be established forever."'"
\p
\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
\p
\v 16 Then David the king went in, and sat before יהוה; and he said, "Who am I, יהוה Elohim, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
\v 17 This was a small thing in Your eyes, Elohim; but You have spoken of Your servant's house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree, יהוה Elohim.
\v 18 What can David say yet more to You concerning the honor which is done to Your servant? For You know Your servant.
\v 19 יהוה, for Your servant's sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things.
\v 20 יהוה, there is no one like You, neither is there any Elohim besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\v 21 What one nation in the earth is like your people Yisra'el, whom Elohim went to redeem to Himself for a people, to make You a Name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeem out of Mitsrayim?
\p
\v 22 "For You made Your people Yisra'el Your own people forever; and You, יהוה, became their Elohim.
\v 23 Now, יהוה, let the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant, and concerning his house, be firm forever, and do as You have spoken.
\v 24 Let Your Name be firm and magnified forever, saying, 'יהוה Tsevaot is the Elohim of Yisra'el, even a Elohim to Yisra'el. The house of David Your servant is established before You.'
\v 25 For You, my Elohim, have revealed to Your servant that You will build him a house. Therefore Your servant has found courage to pray before You.
\v 26 Now, יהוה, You are Elohim, and have promised this good thing to Your servant.
\v 27 Now it has pleased You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You; for You, יהוה, have blessed, and it is blessed forever."
\c 18
\p
\v 1 After this, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 2 He defeated Moav; and the Moavites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
\v 3 David defeated Hadadezer king of Tsovah to Ḥamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the Perath River.
\v 4 David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them enough for one hundred chariots.
\v 5 When the Arameans of Dammeseq came to help Hadadezer king of Tsovah, David struck twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians.
\v 6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Dammeseq; and the Arameans became servants to David, and brought tribute. יהוה gave victory to David wherever he went.
\v 7 David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Yerushalayim.
\v 8 From Tibḥath and from Kun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much copper, with which Shelomoh made the copper sea, the pillars, and the vessels of copper.
\p
\v 9 When Tou king of Ḥamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Tsovah,
\v 10 he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and copper.
\v 11 King David also dedicated these to יהוה, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, from Moav, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amaleq.
\v 12 Moreover Avishai the son of Tseruyah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
\v 13 He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. יהוה gave victory to David wherever he went.
\p
\v 14 David reigned over all Yisra'el; and he executed judgment and righteousness for all his people.
\v 15 Yoav the son of Tseruyah was over the army; Yehoshaphat the son of Aḥilud was recorder;
\v 16 Tsadoq the son of Aḥituv, and Avimelekh the son of Evyathar, were priests; Shavsha was scribe;
\v 17 and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief officials serving the king.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 After this, Naḥash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.
\v 2 David said, "I will show loving-kindness to Ḥanun the son of Naḥash, because his father showed loving-kindness to me."
\p
\v 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Ḥanun, "Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Have his servants not come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"
\v 4 So Ḥanun took David's servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away.
\v 5 Then some people went and told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Yeriḥo until your beards have grown, and then return."
\p
\v 6 When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Ḥanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Aram-Naharayim, out of Aram-ma'akah, and out of Tsovah.
\v 7 So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Ma'akah with his people, who came and encamped near Medeva. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
\v 8 When David heard of it, he sent Yoav with all the army of the mighty men.
\p
\v 9 The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.
\v 10 Now when Yoav saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Yisra'el, and put them in array against the Arameans.
\v 11 The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Avishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
\v 12 He said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.
\v 13 Be strengthened, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our Elohim. May יהוה do that which seems good to Him."
\p
\v 14 So Yoav and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Arameans to the battle; and they fled before him.
\v 15 When the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before Avishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Yoav came to Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 16 When the Arameans saw that they were defeated by Yisra'el, they sent messengers, and called out the Arameans who were beyond the River, with Shophak the captain of the army of Hadadezer leading them.
\v 17 David was told about it; so he gathered all Yisra'el together, passed over the Yarden, came to them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Arameans, they fought with him.
\v 18 The Arameans fled before Yisra'el; and David killed of the Aramean men seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and also killed Shophak the captain of the army.
\v 19 When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Yisra'el, they made peace with David, and served him. The Arameans would not help the children of Ammon any more.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 At the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, Yoav led out the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Yerushalayim. Yoav struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.
\v 2 David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. It was set on David's head, and he brought very much plunder out of the city.
\v 3 He brought out the people who were in it, and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 4 After this, war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbekai the Ḥushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the Rephaim; and they were subdued.
\p
\v 5 Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elḥanan the son of Yair killed Laḥmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
\v 6 There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born to the Rephaim.
\v 7 When he defied Yisra'el, Yehonathan the son of Shimea David's brother killed him.
\v 8 These were born to the Rephaim in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Satan stood up against Yisra'el, and moved David to number Yisra'el.
\v 2 David said to Yoav and to the princes of the people, "Go, count Yisra'el from Beersheva even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are."
\p
\v 3 Yoav said, "May יהוה make His people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my master the king, are they not all my master's servants? Why does my master require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Yisra'el?"
\p
\v 4 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Yoav. Therefore Yoav departed, and went throughout all Yisra'el, then came to Yerushalayim.
\v 5 Yoav gave up the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Yisra'el were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Yehudah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.
\v 6 But he did not count Levi and Benyamin among them; for the king's word was abominable to Yoav.
\p
\v 7 Elohim was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Yisra'el.
\v 8 David said to Elohim, "I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg You, the iniquity of Your servant; for I have done very foolishly."
\p
\v 9 יהוה spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
\v 10 "Go and speak to David, saying, 'יהוה says, "I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you."'"
\p
\v 11 So Gad came to David, and said to him, "יהוה says, 'Take your choice:
\v 12 either three years of famine; or three new moons to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of יהוה, even pestilence in the land, and the messenger of יהוה destroying throughout all the borders of Yisra'el.' Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to Him who sent me."
\p
\v 13 David said to Gad, "I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of יהוה; for His compassion is very great. Do not let me fall into man's hand."
\p
\v 14 So יהוה sent a pestilence on Yisra'el, and seventy thousand men of Yisra'el fell.
\v 15 Elohim sent a messenger to Yerushalayim to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, יהוה saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying messenger, "It is enough. Now withdraw your hand." The messenger of יהוה was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Yevusite.
\v 16 David lifted up his eyes, and saw the messenger of יהוה standing between earth and the heavens, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Yerushalayim. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
\v 17 David said to Elohim, "Is it not I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let Your hand, O יהוה my Elohim, be against me, and against my father's house; but not against Your people, that they should be plagued."
\p
\v 18 Then the messenger of יהוה commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to יהוה on the threshing floor of Ornan the Yevusite.
\v 19 David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the Name of יהוה.
\p
\v 20 Ornan turned back, and saw the messenger; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\v 21 As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
\p
\v 22 Then David said to Ornan, "Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to יהוה on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people."
\p
\v 23 Ornan said to David, "Take it for yourself, and let my master the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for ascension offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all."
\p
\v 24 King David said to Ornan, "No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for יהוה, nor offer an ascension offering that costs me nothing."
\p
\v 25 So David gave to Ornan six hundred sheqels of gold by weight for the place.
\v 26 David built an altar to יהוה there, and offered ascension offerings and peace offerings, and called on יהוה; and He answered him from the heavens by fire on the altar of ascension offering.
\p
\v 27 Then יהוה commanded the messenger, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
\v 28 At that time, when David saw that יהוה had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Yevusite, then he slaughtered there.
\v 29 For the Tabernacle of יהוה, which Mosheh made in the wilderness, and the altar of ascension offering, were at that time in the high place at Givon.
\v 30 But David could not go before it to inquire of Elohim; for he was afraid because of the sword of the messenger of יהוה.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then David said, "This is the house of יהוה Elohim, and this is the altar of ascension offering for Yisra'el."
\p
\v 2 David gave orders to gather together the sojourners who were in the land of Yisra'el; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build the house of Elohim.
\v 3 David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and copper in abundance without weight;
\v 4 and cedar trees without number, for the Tsidonians and the people of Tsor brought cedar trees in abundance to David.
\v 5 David said, "Shelomoh my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for יהוה must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it." So David prepared abundantly before his death.
\p
\v 6 Then he called for Shelomoh his son, and commanded him to build a house for יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 7 David said to Shelomoh his son, "As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the Name of יהוה my Elohim.
\v 8 But the word of יהוה came to me, saying, 'You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to My Name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight.
\v 9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Shelomoh, and I will give peace and quietness to Yisra'el in his days.
\v 10 He shall build a house for My Name; and he will be My son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Yisra'el for ever.'
\v 11 Now, my son, may יהוה be with you and prosper you, and build the house of יהוה your Elohim, as He has spoken concerning you.
\v 12 May יהוה give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Yisra'el; that so you may guard the Torah of יהוה your Elohim.
\v 13 Then you will prosper, if you guard to do the statutes and the judgments which יהוה gave Mosheh concerning Yisra'el. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid, and do not be dismayed.
\v 14 Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of יהוה one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and copper and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.
\v 15 There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work;
\v 16 of the gold, the silver, the copper, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may יהוה be with you."
\p
\v 17 David also commanded all the princes of Yisra'el to help Shelomoh his son, saying,
\v 18 "Is יהוה your Elohim not with you? Has He not given you rest on every side? For He has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before יהוה, and before His people.
\v 19 Now set your heart and your being to follow יהוה your Elohim. Arise therefore, and build the set-apart place of יהוה Elohim, to bring the ark of the covenant of יהוה and the set-apart vessels of Elohim into the house that is to be built for the Name of יהוה."
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Now David was old and full of days; and he made Shelomoh his son king over Yisra'el.
\v 2 He gathered together all the princes of Yisra'el, with the priests and the Levites.
\v 3 The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.
\v 4 David said, "Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of יהוה, six thousand were officers and judges,
\v 5 four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised יהוה with the instruments which I made for giving praise."
\p
\v 6 David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Qohath, and Merari.
\p
\v 7 Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimi.
\v 8 The sons of Ladan: Yeḥi'el the chief, Zetham, and Yo'el, three.
\v 9 The sons of Shimi: Shelomoth, Ḥazi'el, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' households of Ladan.
\v 10 The sons of Shimi: Yaḥath, Zina, Yeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimi.
\v 11 Yaḥath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Yeush and Beriah did not have many sons; therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning.
\p
\v 12 The sons of Qohath: Amram, Yitshar, Ḥevron, and Uzzi'el, four.
\v 13 The sons of Amram: Aharon and Mosheh; and Aharon was separated, that he should set apart the most set-apart things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before יהוה, to minister to Him, and to bless in His Name, forever.
\v 14 But as for Mosheh the man of Elohim, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
\v 15 The sons of Mosheh: Gershom and Eliezer.
\v 16 The sons of Gershom: Shevu'el the chief.
\v 17 The sons of Eliezer were: Reḥavyah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Reḥavyah were very many.
\v 18 The sons of Yitshar: Shelomith the chief.
\v 19 The sons of Ḥevron: Yeriyahu the chief, Amaryah the second, Yaḥazi'el the third, and Yeqameam the fourth.
\v 20 The sons of Uzzi'el: Mikhah the chief, and Yishshiyah the second.
\v 21 The sons of Merari: Maḥli and Mushi. The sons of Maḥli: Elazar and Qish.
\v 22 Elazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Qish took them as wives.
\v 23 The sons of Mushi: Maḥli, Eder, and Yeremoth, three.
\p
\v 24 These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of יהוה, from twenty years old and upward.
\v 25 For David said, "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, has given rest to His people; and He dwells in Yerushalayim forever.
\v 26 Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the Tabernacle and all its vessels for its service."
\p
\v 27 For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward.
\v 28 For their office was to wait on the sons of Aharon for the service of the house of יהוה, in the courts, and in the rooms, and in the purifying of all set-apart things, even the work of the service of the house of Elohim;
\v 29 for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size;
\v 30 and to stand every morning to thank and praise יהוה, and likewise in the evening;
\v 31 and to offer all ascension offerings to יהוה, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set Feasts, in number according to the judgment concerning them, continually before יהוה;
\v 32 and that they should guard the charge of the Tent of Appointment, the charge of the set-apart place, and the charge of the sons of Aharon their brothers, for the service of the house of יהוה.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 These were the divisions of the sons of Aharon. The sons of Aharon: Nadav, Avihu, Elazar, and Ithamar.
\v 2 But Nadav and Avihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Elazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.
\v 3 David with Tsadoq of the sons of Elazar, and Aḥimelekh of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.
\v 4 There were more chief men found of the sons of Elazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Elazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers' houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers' houses, eight.
\v 5 Thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the set-apart place, and princes of Elohim, both of the sons of Elazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
\p
\v 6 Shemayah the son of Nethan'el the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes, Tsadoq the priest, Aḥimelekh the son of Evyathar, and the heads of the fathers' households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers' house being taken for Elazar, and one taken for Ithamar.
\v 7 Now the first lot came out to Yehoyariv, the second to Yedayah,
\v 8 the third to Ḥarim, the fourth to Seorim,
\v 9 the fifth to Malkiyah, the sixth to Miyamin,
\v 10 the seventh to Haqots, the eighth to Aviyah,
\v 11 the ninth to Yeshua, the tenth to Shekanyahu,
\v 12 the eleventh to Elyashiv, the twelfth to Yakim,
\v 13 the thirteenth to Ḥuppah, the fourteenth to Yeshevav,
\v 14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
\v 15 the seventeenth to Ḥezir, the eighteenth to Happitsets,
\v 16 the nineteenth to Pethaḥyah, the twentieth to Yeḥezqel,
\v 17 the twenty-first to Yakin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
\v 18 the twenty-third to Delayahu, and the twenty-fourth to Ma'azyahu.
\v 19 This was their ordering in their service, to come into the house of יהוה according to the judgment given to them by Aharon their father, as יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, had commanded him.
\p
\v 20 Of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shuvael; of the sons of Shuva'el, Yeḥdeyahu.
\v 21 Of Reḥavyahu: of the sons of Reḥavyahu, Yishshiyah the chief.
\v 22 Of the Yitsharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Yaḥath.
\v 23 The sons of Ḥevron: Yeriyahu, Amaryahu the second, Yaḥazi'el the third, and Yekameam the fourth.
\v 24 The sons of Uzzi'el: Mikhah; of the sons of Mikhah, Shamir.
\v 25 The brother of Mikhah: Yishshiyah; of the sons of Yishshiyah, Zekharyahu.
\v 26 The sons of Merari: Maḥli and Mushi. The son of Ya'aziyahu: Beno.
\v 27 The sons of Merari: of Ya'aziyah, Beno, Shoham, Zakkur, and Ivri.
\v 28 Of Maḥli: Elazar, who had no sons.
\v 29 Of Qish, the son of Qish: Yeraḥme'el.
\v 30 The sons of Mushi: Maḥli, Eder, and Yerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers' houses.
\v 31 These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aharon in the presence of David the king, Tsadoq, Aḥimelekh, and the heads of the fathers' households of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers' households of the chief even as those of his younger brother.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Yeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals. The number of those who did the work according to their service was:
\v 2 of the sons of Asaph: Zakkur, Yoseph, Nethanyah, and Asharelah. The sons of Asaph were under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied at the order of the king.
\v 3 Of Yeduthun; the sons of Yeduthun: Gedalyahu, Tseri, Yeshayahu, Shimi, Ḥashavyahu, and Mattithyahu, six, under the hands of their father Yeduthun, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising יהוה with the harp.
\v 4 Of Heman; the sons of Heman: Buqqiyahu, Mattanyahu, Uzzi'el, Shevu'el, Yerimoth, Ḥananyah, Ḥanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Yoshbeqashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Maḥazioth.
\v 5 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of Elohim, to lift up the horn. Elohim gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
\v 6 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of יהוה, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, for the service of the house of Elohim; Asaph, Yeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king.
\v 7 The number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to יהוה, even all who were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight.
\v 8 They cast lots for their offices, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student.
\p
\v 9 Now the first lot came out for Asaph to Yoseph; the second to Gedalyah, he and his brothers and sons were twelve;
\v 10 the third to Zakkur, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 11 the fourth to Yitsri, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 12 the fifth to Nethanyahu, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 13 the sixth to Buqqiyah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 14 the seventh to Yesharelah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 15 the eighth to Yeshayahu, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 16 the ninth to Mattanyahu, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 17 the tenth to Shimi, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 18 the eleventh to Azar'el, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 19 the twelfth to Ḥashavyah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 20 for the thirteenth, Shuva'el, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 21 for the fourteenth, Mattithyahu, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 22 for the fifteenth to Yeremoth, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 23 for the sixteenth to Ḥananyahu, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 24 for the seventeenth to Yoshbeqashah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 25 for the eighteenth to Ḥanani, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 26 for the nineteenth to Mallothi, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 27 for the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 28 for the twenty-first to Hothir, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 29 for the twenty-second to Giddalti, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 30 for the twenty-third to Maḥazioth, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 31 for the twenty-fourth to Romamti-Ezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 For the divisions of the doorkeepers: of the Qoraḥites, Meshelemyahu the son of Qore, of the sons of Asaph.
\v 2 Meshelemyahu had sons: Zekharyahu the firstborn, Yediya'el the second, Zevadyahu the third, Yathni'el the fourth,
\v 3 Elam the fifth, Yehoḥanan the sixth, and Eliehoenai the seventh.
\v 4 Oved-Edom had sons: Shemayah the firstborn, Yehozavad the second, Yoaḥ the third, Sakar the fourth, Nethan'el the fifth,
\v 5 Ammi'el the sixth, Yissakhar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth; for Elohim blessed him.
\v 6 Sons were also born to Shemayah his son, who ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor.
\v 7 The sons of Shemayah: Othni, Repha'el, Oved, and Elzavad, whose brothers were valiant men, Elihu, and Semakyahu.
\v 8 All these were of the sons of Oved-Edom: they and their sons and their brothers, able men in strength for the service; sixty-two of Oved-Edom.
\v 9 Meshelemyahu had sons and brothers, valiant men, eighteen.
\v 10 Also Ḥosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him chief),
\v 11 Ḥilqiyahu the second, Tevalyahu the third, and Zekharyahu the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Ḥosah were thirteen.
\v 12 Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brothers, to minister in the house of יהוה.
\p
\v 13 They cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their fathers' houses, for every gate.
\v 14 The lot eastward fell to Shelemyahu. Then for Zekharyahu his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.
\v 15 To Oved-Edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse.
\v 16 To Shuppim and Ḥosah westward, by the gate of Shallekheth, at the causeway that goes up, watchman opposite watchman.
\v 17 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two.
\v 18 For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.
\v 19 These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the Qoraḥites, and of the sons of Merari.
\p
\v 20 Of the Levites, Aḥiyah was over the treasures of the house of Elohim and over the treasures of the dedicated things.
\v 21 The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers' households belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Yeḥi'eli.
\v 22 The sons of Yeḥi'eli: Zetham, and Yo'el his brother, over the treasures of the house of יהוה.
\v 23 Of the Amramites, of the Yitsharites, of the Ḥevronites, of the Uzzi'elites:
\v 24 and Shevu'el the son of Gershom, the son of Mosheh, was ruler over the treasures.
\v 25 His brothers: of Eliezer, Reḥavyahu his son, and Yeshayahu his son, and Yoram his son, and Zikri his son, and Shelomoth his son.
\v 26 This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads of the fathers' households, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated.
\v 27 They dedicated some of the plunder won in battles to repair the house of יהוה.
\v 28 All that Shemu'el the seer, and Sha'ul the son of Qish, and Avner the son of Ner, and Yoav the son of Tseruyah, had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth, and of his brothers.
\p
\v 29 Of the Yitsharites, Kenanyahu and his sons were for the outward business over Yisra'el, for officers and judges.
\v 30 Of the Ḥevronites, Ḥashavyahu and his brothers, men of valor, one thousand seven hundred, had the oversight of Yisra'el beyond the Yarden westward, for all the business of יהוה, and for the service of the king.
\v 31 Of the Ḥevronites was Yeriyah the chief, even of the Ḥevronites, according to their generations by fathers' households. They were sought for in the fortieth year of the reign of David, and mighty men of valor were found among them at Yazer of Gilad.
\v 32 His brothers, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred, heads of fathers' households, whom King David made overseers over the Reuvenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Menashites, for every matter pertaining to Elohim, and for the affairs of the king.

\v 1 Now the children of Yisra'el after their number, the heads of fathers' households and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the king, in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out new moon by new moon throughout all the new moons of the year—of every division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 2 Over the first division for the first new moon was Yashovam the son of ZAvdi'el: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 3 He was of the children of Perets, the chief of all the captains of the army for the first new moon.
\v 4 Over the division of the second new moon was Dodai the Aḥoḥite, and his division; and Miqloth the ruler: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 5 The third captain of the army for the third new moon was Benayahu, the son of Yehoyada the priest, chief: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 6 This is that Benayahu who was the mighty man of the thirty, and over the thirty: and of his division was Ammizavad his son.
\p
\v 7 The fourth captain for the fourth new moon was Asah'el the brother of Yoav, and Zevadyah his son after him: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 8 The fifth captain for the fifth new moon was Shamhuth the Yitsraḥite: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 9 The sixth captain for the sixth new moon was Ira the son of Iqqesh the Teqoite: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 10 The seventh captain for the seventh new moon was Ḥelets the Pelonite, of the children of Ephrayim: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 11 The eighth captain for the eighth new moon was Sibbekai the Ḥushathite, of the Zeraḥites: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 12 The ninth captain for the ninth new moon was Aviezer the Anathothite, of the Benyamites: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 13 The tenth captain for the tenth new moon was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zeraḥites: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 14 The eleventh captain for the eleventh new moon was Benayah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephrayim: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 15 The twelfth captain for the twelfth new moon was Ḥeldai the Netophathite, of Othni'el: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\p
\v 16 Furthermore over the tribes of Yisra'el: of the Reuvenites was Eliezer the son of Zikri the ruler; of the Shimonites, Shephatyahu the son of Ma'akah;
\v 17 of Levi, Ḥashavyah the son of Qemu'el; of Aharon, Tsadoq;
\v 18 of Yehudah, Elihu, one of the brothers of David; of Yissakhar, Omri the son of Mikha'el;
\v 19 of Zevulun, Yishmayahu the son of Ovadyahu; of Naphtali, Yeremoth the son of Azri'el;
\v 20 of the children of Ephrayim, Hoshea the son of Azazyahu; of the half-tribe of Menasheh, Yo'el the son of Pedayahu;
\v 21 of the half-tribe of Menasheh in Gilad, Iddo the son of Zekharyahu; of Benyamin, Ya'asi'el the son of Avner;
\v 22 of Dan, Azar'el the son of Yeroḥam. These were the captains of the tribes of Yisra'el.
\v 23 But David did not take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because יהוה had said he would increase Yisra'el like the stars of the heavens.
\v 24 Yoav the son of Tseruyah began to take a census, but did not finish; and wrath came on Yisra'el for this. The number was not put into the account in the chronicles of King David.
\p
\v 25 Over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adi'el; and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, was Yehonathan the son of Uzziyahu;
\v 26 over those who did the work of the field for service of the ground was Ezri the son of Keluv;
\v 27 and over the vineyards was Shimi the Ramathite; and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zavdi the Shiphmite;
\v 28 and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Ba'al Ḥanan the Gederite; and over the cellars of oil was Yoash;
\v 29 and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite; and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai;
\v 30 and over the camels was Ovil the Yishma'elite; and over the donkeys was Yeḥdeyah the Meronothite; and over the flocks was Yaziz the Hagrite.
\v 31 All these were the rulers of the property which was King David's.
\p
\v 32 Also Yehonathan, David's uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe; and Yeḥi'el the son of Ḥakmoni was with the king's sons.
\v 33 Aḥithophel was the king's counselor: and Ḥushai the Arkite was the king's friend.
\v 34 After Aḥithophel was Yehoyada the son of Benayahu, and Evyathar. Yoav was the captain of the king's army.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 David assembled all the princes of Yisra'el, the princes of the tribes, the captains of the companies who served the king by division, the captains of thousands, the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Yerushalayim.
\v 2 Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, "Hear me, my brothers, and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of יהוה, and for the footstool of our Elohim; and I had prepared for the building.
\v 3 But Elohim said to me, 'You shall not build a house for My Name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.'
\v 4 However יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Yisra'el forever. For He has chosen Yehudah to be prince; and in the house of Yehudah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father He took pleasure in me to make me king over all Yisra'el.
\v 5 Of all my sons (for יהוה has given me many sons), He has chosen Shelomoh my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of יהוה over Yisra'el.
\v 6 He said to me, 'Shelomoh, your son, shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be his father.
\v 7 I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do My commands and My judgments, as it is today.'
\p
\v 8 Now therefore, in the sight of all Yisra'el, the assembly of יהוה, and in the audience of our Elohim, guard and seek out all the commands of יהוה your Elohim; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.
\v 9 You, Shelomoh my son, know the Elohim of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing being; for יהוה searches all hearts, and understands all the inclinations of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.
\v 10 Take heed now; for יהוה has chosen you to build a house for the set-apart place. Be strong, and do it."
\p
\v 11 Then David gave to Shelomoh his son the plans for the porch of the Temple, for its houses, for its treasuries, for its upper rooms, for its inner rooms, for the place of the lid;
\v 12 and the plans of all that he had by the Ruaḥ, for the courts of the house of יהוה, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of Elohim, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;
\v 13 also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of יהוה, and for all the vessels of service in the house of יהוה;
\v 14 of gold by weight for the gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;
\v 15 by weight also for the menorot of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every menorah and for its lamps; and for the menorot of silver, by weight for every menorah and for its lamps, according to the service of every menorah;
\v 16 and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;
\v 17 and the forks, the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;
\v 18 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the plans for the chariot, and the keruvim that spread out and cover the ark of the covenant of יהוה.
\v 19 "All this", said David, "I have been made to understand in writing from the hand of יהוה, even all the works of this pattern."
\p
\v 20 David said to Shelomoh his son, "Be strong and courageous, and do it. Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; for יהוה Elohim, even my Elohim, is with you. He will not fail you, nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of יהוה is finished.
\v 21 Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of Elohim. Every willing wise man, for any kind of service, shall be with you in all kinds of work. Also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command."
\c 29
\p
\v 1 David the king said to all the assembly, "Shelomoh my son, whom alone Elohim has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for יהוה Elohim.
\v 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my Elohim: the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the copper for the things of copper, iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; also onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
\p
\v 3 "In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my Elohim, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my Elohim, over and above all that I have prepared for the set-apart house,
\v 4 even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;
\v 5 of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to set himself apart today to יהוה?"
\p
\v 6 Then the princes of the fathers' households, and the princes of the tribes of Yisra'el, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly;
\v 7 and they gave for the service of the house of Elohim of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, of silver ten thousand talents, of copper eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand talents.
\p
\v 8 People with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of יהוה, under the hand of Yeḥi'el the Gershonite.
\v 9 Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to יהוה; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
\p
\v 10 Therefore David blessed יהוה before all the assembly; and David said, "You are blessed, יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el our father, forever and ever.
\v 11 Yours, יהוה, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is Yours. Yours is the kingdom, יהוה, and You are exalted as head above all.
\v 12 Both riches and honor come from You, and You rule over all! In Your hand is power and might! It is in Your hand to make great, and to give strength to all!
\v 13 Now therefore, our Elohim, we thank You, and praise Your glorious Name.
\p
\v 14 "But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from You, and of Your own have we given You.
\v 15 For we are sojourners before You, and guests, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining.
\v 16 יהוה our Elohim, all this store that we have prepared to build You a house for Your set-apart Name comes from Your hand, and is all Your own.
\v 17 I know also, my Elohim, that You try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now I have seen with joy Your people, who are present here, offer willingly to You.
\v 18 יהוה, the Elohim of Avraham, of Yitsḥaq, and of Yisra'el, our fathers, guard this desire forever in the inclinations of the heart of Your people, and prepare their heart for You;
\v 19 and give to Shelomoh my son a perfect heart, to guard Your commands, Your witnesses, and Your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision."
\p
\v 20 Then David said to all the assembly, "Now bless יהוה your Elohim!" All the assembly blessed יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, and stooped their heads low and bowed themselves down before יהוה and the king.
\p
\v 21 They slaughtered sacrifices to יהוה, and offered ascension offerings to יהוה, on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and slaughterings in abundance for all Yisra'el,
\v 22 and ate and drank before יהוה on that day with great gladness. They made Shelomoh the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before יהוה to be prince, and Tsadoq to be priest.
\p
\v 23 Then Shelomoh sat on the throne of יהוה as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Yisra'el obeyed him.
\v 24 All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of King David submitted themselves to Shelomoh the king.
\v 25 יהוה magnified Shelomoh exceedingly in the sight of all Yisra'el, and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Yisra'el.
\p
\v 26 Now David the son of Yishai reigned over all Yisra'el.
\v 27 The time that he reigned over Yisra'el was forty years; he reigned seven years in Ḥevron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Yerushalayim.
\v 28 He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Shelomoh his son reigned in his place.
\v 29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Shemu'el the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
\v 30 with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Yisra'el, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
