\ms Parashat Bereshiyt – פרשת בראשית
\p
\v 1 In \add the\add* beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth.
\v 2 And the earth became a waste and a void, and darkness was over the face of the deep, and the Ruaḥ of Elohim fluttered over the face of the waters.
\v 3 And Elohim said, "Let light be;" and there was light.
\v 4 And Elohim saw the light, that it was good; and Elohim separated the light from the darkness.
\v 5 And Elohim called the light 'day,' and the darkness He called 'night.' And there was evening and there was morning, day one. \f + \fr 1:5 \ft While the rest of chapter 1 uses ordinal numbers (eg. second, third, fourth, etc.) verse 5 actually uses the Hebrew word אחד (e'ḥad), which is the cardinal number one. This is different from the ordinal number meaning "first" which is represented by the Hebrew word ראשון (rish'on). Thus it literally reads, "day one" and not "the first day."\f*
\p
\v 6 And Elohim said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."
\v 7 And Elohim made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.
\v 8 And Elohim called the expanse 'heavens.' And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
\p
\v 9 And Elohim said, "Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, \f + \fr 1:9 \ft LXX reads "places" plural. DSS reads "gatherings".\f* and let the dry land appear;" and it was so. [And the waters under the heavens were gathered together to their place, and the dry land appeared.] \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading present in the DSS and the LXX but absent from the Heb. MT.\f*
\v 10 And Elohim called the dry land 'earth,' and the gathering of the waters He called 'seas;' and Elohim saw that it was good.
\v 11 And Elohim said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation: plants yielding seed, \add and\add* fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them;" and it was so.
\v 12 And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind; and Elohim saw that it was good.
\v 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
\p
\v 14 And Elohim said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for appointed times and for days and years;
\v 15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth;" and it was so.
\v 16 And Elohim made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night, and the stars also.
\v 17 And Elohim placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,
\v 18 and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and Elohim saw that it was good.
\v 19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
\p
\v 20 And Elohim said, "Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens."
\p
\v 21 And Elohim created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind; and Elohim saw that it was good.
\v 22 And Elohim blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
\v 23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
\p
\v 24 And Elohim said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind;" and it was so.
\v 25 And Elohim made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and Elohim saw that it was good.
\p
\v 26 And Elohim said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
\v 27 And Elohim created man in His own image: in the image of Elohim He created him. Male and female He created them.
\v 28 And Elohim blessed them; and Elohim said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
\v 29 And Elohim said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you;
\v 30 and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, \add I have given\add* every green plant for food;" and it was so.
31 And Elohim saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts.
\v 2 And in the seventh \f + \fr 2:2 \ft LXX, Sam., and Syr. read "sixth" here instead of "seventh."\f* day Elohim completed His work which He had done, and He ceased on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.
\v 3 Then Elohim blessed the seventh day and set it apart, because in it He ceased from all His work which Elohim, in creating, had made.
\p
\v 4 This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that יהוה Elohim made earth and heavens.
\v 5 And no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for יהוה Elohim had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to serve the ground.
\v 6 But a mist would rise from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground.
\v 7 And יהוה Elohim formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the יהוה breath of life; and man became a living being.
\v 8 יהוה Elohim planted a garden toward the east, in Eden; and there He placed the man whom He had formed.
\v 9 Out of the ground יהוה Elohim caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
\p
\v 10 And a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers.
\v 11 The name of the first is Pishon; it flows around the whole land of Ḥavilah, where there is gold.
\v 12 The gold of that land is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
\v 13 The name of the second river is Giḥon; it flows around the whole land of Kush.
\v 14 The name of the third river is Ḥiddeqel; \f + \fr 2:14 \fk Ḥiddeqel: \ft - The Tigris River.\f* it flows east of Ashuwr. And the fourth river is the Perath. \f + \fr 2:14 \fk Perath: \ft - The Euphrates River, and probably the etymological origin of the name.\f*
\p
\v 15 And יהוה Elohim took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to serve it and guard it.
\v 16 And יהוה Elohim commanded the man, saying, "From any tree of the garden you may eat freely;
\v 17 but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die."
\p
\v 18 And יהוה Elohim said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him."
\v 19 Out of the ground יהוה Elohim formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens, and brought \add them\add* to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name. 20 The man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him.
\v 21 So יהוה Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.
\v 22 יהוה Elohim fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.
\p
\v 23 And the man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'Woman,' because she was taken out of Man."
\p
\v 24 For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they [two] \f + \fr 2:25 \ft LXX, Lat., Syr., Sam., Targum Neofiti, and Jerusalem Targum all read as it is here. Heb. MT, however, omits the bracketed "two" here. Compare Korinthious A 6:16; Ephesious 5:31.\f* shall become one flesh.
\v 25 And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And the naḥash was more crafty than any beast of the field which יהוה Elohim had made. And he said to the woman, "Indeed, has Elohim said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?"
\v 2 And the woman said to the naḥash, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;
\v 3 but from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, Elohim has said, 'You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.'"
\v 4 And the naḥash said to the woman, "You surely will not die!
\v 5 For Elohim knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like Elohim, knowing good and evil."
\v 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make \add one\add* wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
\v 7 And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
\p
\v 8 And they heard the voice of יהוה Elohim walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of יהוה Elohim among the trees of the garden.
\v 9 And יהוה Elohim called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
\v 10 And he said, "I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself."
\v 11 And He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
\v 12 And the man said, "The woman whom You gave \add to be\add* with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate."
\v 13 And יהוה Elohim said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" And the woman said, "The naḥash deceived me, and I ate."
\p
\v 14 And יהוה Elohim said to the naḥash, "Because you have done this, cursed are you more than all cattle, and more than every beast of the field; on your belly you will go, and dust you will eat all the days of your life.
\v 15 And I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise you on the head, and you shall bruise him on the heel."
\p
\v 16 And to the woman He said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth; in pain you will bring forth children, \add and\add* your turning will be to your husband, and he will rule over you."
\p
\v 17 And to Adam He said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you will eat of it all the days of your life.
\p
\v 18 "Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you; and you will eat the plants of the field.
\v 19 By the sweat of your face you will eat bread, until you return to the ground, because from it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
\p
\v 20 Now the man called his wife's name Ḥavvah, \f + \fr 3:20 \fk Ḥavvah \ft ( חוה – ḥavvah) meaning "life-giver."\f* because she was the mother of all living.
\v 21 יהוה Elohim made tunics of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.
\p
\v 22 And יהוה Elohim said, "Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever;" –
\v 23 therefore יהוה Elohim sent him out from the garden of Eden, to serve the ground from which he was taken.
\v 24 So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the keruvim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And the man knew his wife Ḥavvah, and she conceived and brought forth Qayin, and she said, "I have gained a man \add from\add* \f + \fr 4:1 \ft Hebrew phrase מקץ ימים (miqqets yamim) rendered as "the course of time" is literally translated as "after days," a possible indication of the end of the week or perhaps the end of the year.\f* יהוה."
\v 2 And again she brought forth his brother Havel. And Havel became a shepherd of flocks, but Qayin became a servant of \add the\add* ground.
\v 3 And it came about in the course of timeb that Qayin brought an offering to יהוה of the fruit of the ground.
\v 4 Havel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And יהוה had regard for Havel and for his offering;
\v 5 but for Qayin and for his offering He had no regard. So Qayin became very angry and his countenance fell.
\v 6 And יהוה said to Qayin, "Why are you angry? And why has your face fallen? \f + \fr 4:6 \ft Face fallen – Idiom meaning "sad."\f*
\v 7 If you do well, will not \add your countenance\add* be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its turning is to you, but you must master it."
\v 8 Qayin said to Havel his brother, ["let us go out to the field."] \fn + \fr 4:8 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading present in Sam., LXX, Syr. and Lat. but absent from Heb. MT.\f* And it came about when they were in the field, that Qayin rose up against Havel his brother and killed him.
\p
\v 9 And יהוה said to Qayin, "Where is Havel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I the guard of my brother?"
\v 10 He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to Me from the ground.
\v 11 And you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
\v 12 When you serve the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth."
\v 13 And Qayin said to יהוה, "My iniquity is too great to bear!
\v 14 Behold, You have driven me from the face of the ground today; and from Your face I will be hidden, and I will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
\v 15 So יהוה said to him, "Therefore whoever kills Qayin, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." And יהוה appointed a sign for Qayin, so that no one finding him would slay him.
\p
\v 16 And Qayin went out from the presence of יהוה, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
\p
\v 17 And Qayin knew his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Ḥanokh; and he built a city, and called the name of the city Ḥanokh, after the name of his son.
\v 18 And to Ḥanokh was born Irad, and Irad brought forth Meḥuya'el, and Meḥuya'el brought forth Methusha'el, and Methusha'el brought forth Lamekh.
\v 19 Lamekh took to himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other, Tsillah.
\v 20 Adah gave birth to Yaval; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and \add have\add* livestock.
\v 21 His brother's name was Yuval; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
\v 22 As for Tsillah, she also gave birth to Tuval-Qayin, the forger of all implements of copper and iron; and the sister of Tuval-Qayin was Na'amah.
\p
\v 23 Lamekh said to his wives, "Adah and Tsillah, listen to my voice, you wives of Lamekh, give heed to my speech, for I have killed a man for wounding me; and a young man for striking me;
\v 24 if Qayin is avenged sevenfold, then Lamekh seventy-sevenfold."
\p
\v 25 And Adam knew his wife again, and she brought forth a son, and named him Sheth, for she said, "Elohim has appointed me another seed in place of Havel, for Qayin killed him."
\v 26 And to Sheth also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the Name of יהוה. \f + \fr 4:26 \ft Targum Onkelos records verse 26 as "Then in his [Enosh's] days, men desisted calling on the Name of יהוה." Targum Jonathan reads, "That was the generation in whose days they began to err, and to make themselves idols, and surnamed their idols by the Name of the Word of יהוה." A number of other commentators have stated that the phrase "call upon the Name of יהוה" means, rather, to call their false elohim by the Name of the One True Elohim.\f*
\c 5
\p
\v 1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when Elohim created man, He made him in the likeness of Elohim.
\v 2 He created them male and female, and He blessed them and named them Man in the day when they were created.
\p
\v 3 And when Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he brought forth \add a son\add* in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him Sheth.
\v 4 And the days of Adam after he brought forth Sheth were eight hundred years, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\v 5 So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
\p
\v 6 Sheth lived one hundred and five years, and brought forth Enosh.
\v 7 And Sheth lived eight hundred and seven years after he brought forth Enosh, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\v 8 So all the days of Sheth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
\p
\v 9 Enosh lived ninety years, and brought forth Qenan.
\v 10 And Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after he brought forth Qenan, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\v 11 So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died.
\p
\v 12 Qenan lived seventy years, and brought forth Mahalal'el.
\v 13 And Qenan lived eight hundred and forty years after he brought forth Mahalal'el, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\v 14 So all the days of Qenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.
\p
\v 15 Mahalal'el lived sixty-five years, and brought forth Yared.
\v 16 And Mahalal'el lived eight hundred and thirty years after he brought forth Yared, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\v 17 So all the days of Mahalal'el were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.
\p
\v 18 Yared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and brought forth Ḥanokh.
\v 19 And Yared lived eight hundred years after he brought forth Ḥanokh, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\v 20 So all the days of Yared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.
\p
\v 21 Ḥanokh lived sixty-five years, and brought forth Methuselaḥ.
\v 22 And Ḥanokh walked with Elohim three hundred years after he brought forth Methuselaḥ, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\v 23 So all the days of Ḥanokh were three hundred and sixty-five years.
\v 24 Ḥanokh walked with Elohim; and he was not, for Elohim took him.
\p
\v 25 Methuselaḥ lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and brought forth Lamekh.
\v 26 And Methuselaḥ lived seven hundred and eighty-two years after he brought forth Lamekh, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\v 27 So all the days of Methuselaḥ were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.
\p
\v 28 Lamekh lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and brought forth a son.
\v 29 Now he called his name Noaḥ, saying, "This one will give us rest from our work and from the pain of our hands \add arising\add* from the ground which יהוה has cursed."
\v 30 And Lamekh lived five hundred and ninety-five years after he brought forth Noaḥ, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\v 31 And all the days of Lamekh were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.
\p
\v 32 Noaḥ was five hundred years old, and Noaḥ brought forth Shem, Ḥam, and Yepheth.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 And it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them,
\v 2 that the sons of Elohim saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose.
\v 3 And יהוה said, "My Ruaḥ shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; \f + \fr 6:3 \ft Syr. reads, "My Ruaḥ shall not dwell in man forever, for he is flesh." LXX reads, "My Ruaḥ shall not remain among these men forever, because they are flesh."\f* nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years."
\v 4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of Elohim came in to the daughters of men, and they bore the same to them. Those were the mighty men who \add were\add* of old, men of renown.
\p
\v 5 And יהוה saw that the evil of man was great on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.
\v 6 יהוה was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.
\v 7 יהוה said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the heavens; for I am sorry that I have made them."
\v 8 But Noaḥ found favor in the eyes of יהוה.
\ms Parashat Noaḥ – פרשת נח
\p
\v 9 These are the generations of Noaḥ. Noaḥ was a righteous man, blameless in his generations; Noaḥ walked with Elohim.
\v 10 Noaḥ brought forth three sons: Shem, Ḥam, and Yepheth.
\p
\v 11 And the earth was corrupt in the sight of Elohim, and the earth was filled with violence.
\v 12 Elohim looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
\p
\v 13 And Elohim said to Noaḥ, "The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth.
\v 14 Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch.
\v 15 This is how you shall make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
\v 16 You shall make a window for the ark, and finish it to a cubit from the top; and set the door of the ark in the side of it; you shall make it with lower, second, and third decks.
\v 17 Behold, I, even I am bringing the flood of water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life, from under the heavens; everything that is on the earth shall perish.
\v 18 But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark-- you and your sons and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
\v 19 And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every \add kind\add* into the ark, to keep \add them\add* alive with you; they shall be male and female.
\v 20 Of the birds after their kind, and of the animals after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every \add kind\add* will come to you to keep \add them\add* alive.
\v 21 As for you, take for yourself some of all food which is edible, and gather \add it\add* to yourself; and it shall be for food for you and for them."
\v 22 Thus Noaḥ did; according to all that Elohim had commanded him, so he did.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Noaḥ, "Enter the ark, you and all your household, for you \add alone\add* I have seen \add to be\add* righteous before Me in this generation.
\v 2 You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female;
\v 3 also of the birds of the heavens, by sevens, male and female, to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.
\v 4 For after seven more days, I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will blot out from the face of the land every living thing that I have made."
\v 5 Noaḥ did according to all that יהוה had commanded him.
\p
\v 6 And Noaḥ was six hundred years old when the flood of water came upon the earth.
\v 7 And Noaḥ and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him entered the ark because of the water of the flood.
\v 8 Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and everything that creeps on the ground,
\v 9 there went into the ark to Noaḥ by twos, male and female, as Elohim had commanded Noaḥ.
\v 10 It came about after the seven days that the water of the flood came upon the earth.
\p
\v 11 In the six hundredth year of Noaḥ's life, in the second new moon, on the seventeenth day of the new moon, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
\v 12 The rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.
\p
\v 13 On the very same day Noaḥ and Shem and Ḥam and Yepheth, the sons of Noaḥ, and Noaḥ's wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark,
\v 14 they and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every wing.
\v 15 And they went into the ark to Noaḥ, by twos of all flesh in which was the breath of life.
\v 16 Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, יהוה entered as Elohim had commanded him; and closed \add it\add* behind him.
\p
\v 17 And the flood came upon the earth for forty days, and the water increased and lifted up the ark, so that it rose above the earth.
\v 18 The water prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
\v 19 The water prevailed more and more upon the earth, so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered.
\v 20 The water prevailed fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered.
\v 21 All flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind;
\v 22 of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died.
\v 23 Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the heavens, and they were blotted out from the earth; and only Noaḥ was left, together with those that were with him in the ark.
\v 24 The water prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 But Elohim remembered Noaḥ and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and Elohim caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided.
\v 2 Also the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the heavens were restrained;
\v 3 and the water receded steadily from the earth, and at the end of one hundred and fifty days the water decreased.
\v 4 In the seventh new moon, on the seventeenth day of the new moon, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat.
\v 5 The water decreased steadily until the tenth \add new moon\add*; in the tenth new moon, on the first day of the new moon, the tops of the mountains became visible.
\p
\v 6 Then it came about at the end of forty days that Noaḥ opened the window of the ark which he had made;
\v 7 and he sent out a raven, and it flew here and there until the water was dried up from the earth.
\v 8 Then he sent out a dove from him, to see if the water was abated from the face of the land;
\v 9 but the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, so she returned to him into the ark, for the water was on the surface of all the earth. Then he put out his hand and took her, and brought her into the ark to himself.
\v 10 So he waited yet another seven days; and again he sent out the dove from the ark.
\v 11 The dove came to him toward evening, and behold, in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf. So Noaḥ knew that the water was abated from the earth.
\v 12 Then he waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; but she did not return to him again.
\p
\v 13 Now it came about in the six hundred and first year, in the first \add new moon\add*, on the first \add day\add* of the new moon, the waters had \add caused\add* devastation over the earth. Then Noaḥ removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was devastated.
\v 14 In the second new moon, on the twenty-seventh day of the new moon, the earth was dry.
\v 15 Then Elohim spoke to Noaḥ, saying,
\v 16 "Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
\v 17 Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you, birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
\v 18 So Noaḥ went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.
\v 19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by their families from the ark.
\p
\v 20 Then Noaḥ built an altar to יהוה, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered ascension offerings on the altar.
\v 21 יהוה smelled the soothing aroma; and יהוה said in His heart, "I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the inclination of man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will never again destroy every living thing, as I have done.
\p
\v 22 "While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And Elohim blessed Noaḥ and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
\v 2 The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the heavens; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given.
\v 3 Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as \add I gave\add* the green plant.
\v 4 Only you shall not eat flesh with its being, \add that is,\add* its blood.
\v 5 Surely I will require the blood of your being; from every beast I will require it. And from \add every\add* man, from every man's brother I will require the being of man.
\p
\v 6 "Whoever sheds man's blood, by man his blood shall be shed, for in the image of Elohim He made man.
\v 7 As for you, be fruitful and multiply; populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it."
\p
\v 8 And Elohim spoke to Noaḥ and to his sons with him, saying,
\v 9 "Now behold, I Myself do establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
\v 10 and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that comes out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
\v 11 I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth."
\v 12 Elohim said, "This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all successive generations;
\v 13 I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.
\v 14 It shall come about, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow will be seen in the cloud,
\v 15 and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh.
\v 16 When the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it, to remember the everlasting covenant between Elohim and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
\v 17 And Elohim said to Noaḥ, "This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth."
\p
\v 18 Now the sons of Noaḥ who came out of the ark were Shem and Ḥam and Yepheth; and Ḥam was the father of Kena'an.
\v 19 These three \add were\add* the sons of Noaḥ, and from these the whole earth was populated.
\p
\v 20 Then Noaḥ began farming and planted a vineyard.
\v 21 He drank of the wine and became drunk, and became uncovered inside his tent.
\v 22 Ḥam, the father of Kena'an, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
\v 23 But Shem and Yepheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned away, so that they did not see their father's nakedness.
\v 24 When Noaḥ awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him.
\p
\v 25 So he said, "Cursed be Kena'an; a servant of servants He shall be to his brothers."
\p
\v 26 He also said, "Blessed be יהוה, the Elohim of Shem; and let Kena'an be his servant.
\p
\v 27 "May Elohim enlarge Yepheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem; and let Kena'an be his servant."
\p
\v 28 Noaḥ lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood.
\v 29 So all the days of Noaḥ were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.
\c 10 
\p
\v 1 Now these are the generations of Shem, Ḥam, and Yepheth, the sons of Noaḥ; and sons were born to them after the flood.
\p
\v 2 The sons of Yepheth \add were\add* Gomer and Magog and Madai and Yavan and Tuval and Meshekh and Tiras.
\v 3 The sons of Gomer \add were\add* Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
\v 4 The sons of Yavan \add were\add* Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.
\v 5 From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations.
\p
\v 6 The sons of Ḥam \add were\add* Kush and Mitsrayim and Put and Kena'an.
\v 7 The sons of Kush \add were\add* Seva and Ḥavilah and Savtah and Ra'amah and Savtekha; and the sons of Ra'amah \add were\add* Sheva and Dedan.
\v 8 Now Kush brought forth Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth.
\v 9 He was a mighty hunter before יהוה; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before יהוה."
\v 10 The beginning of his kingdom was Bavel and Erek and Akkad and Kalneh, in the land of Shinar.
\v 11 From that land he went forth into Ashuwr, and built Nineveh and Reḥovoth-Ir and Kalaḥ,
\v 12 and Resen between Nineveh and Kalaḥ; that is the great city.
\v 13 Mitsrayim brought forth Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuḥim
\v 14 and Pathrusim and Kasluhim (from which came the Philistines) and Kaphtorim.
\p
\v 15 Kena'an brought forth Tsidon, his firstborn, and Ḥeth
\v 16 and the Yevusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite
\v 17 and the Ḥivite and the Arkite and the Sinite
\v 18 and the Arvadite and the Tsemarite and the Ḥamathite; and afterward the families of the Kena'anite were spread abroad.
\v 19 The territory of the Kena'anite extended from Tsidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sedom and Gomorrah and Admah and Tsevoyim, as far as Lasha.
\v 20 These are the sons of Ḥam, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, by their nations.
\p
\v 21 Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Ever, \add and\add* the older brother of Yepheth, \f + \fr 10:21 \ft This verse could also be read as, "...whose older brother was Yepheth..."\f* children were born.
\v 22 The sons of Shem \add were\add* Elam and Ashuwr and Arpakshad and Lud and Aram.
\v 23 The sons of Aram \add were\add* Uts and Ḥul and Gether and Mash.
\v 24 Arpakshad brought forth [Kena'an, and Kena'an brought forth] \fn + \fr 10:24 \ft 24 LXX and DSS both read as it is here. Heb. MT, Syr., Lat., and Sam. do not contain this section. Compare Loukas 3:36.\f* Shelaḥ; and Shelaḥ brought forth Ever.
\v 25 Two sons were born to Ever; the name of the one \add was\add* Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name \add was\add* Yoqtan.
\v 26 Yoqtan brought forth Almodad and Sheleph and Ḥatsarmaveth and Yeraḥ
\v 27 and Hadoram and Uzal and Diqlah
\v 28 and Oval and Avima'el and Sheva
\v 29 and Ophir and Ḥavilah and Yovav; all these were the sons of Yoqtan.
\v 30 Now their settlement extended from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the hill country of the east.
\v 31 These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations.
\p
\v 32 These are the families of the sons of Noaḥ, according to their genealogies, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 And the whole earth used the same language and the same words.
\v 2 It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
\v 3 They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn \add them\add* thoroughly." And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
\v 4 They said, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top \add will reach\add* into heavens, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth."
\v 5 יהוה came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.
\v 6 יהוה said, "Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for them.
\v 7 Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another's speech."
\v 8 So יהוה scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city.
\v 9 Therefore its name was called Babel, because there יהוה confused the language of the whole earth; and from there יהוה scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth.
\p
\v 10 These are the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old, and brought forth Arpakshad two years after the flood;
\v 11 and Shem lived five hundred years after he brought forth Arpakshad, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\p
\v 12 Arpakshad lived thirty-five years, and brought forth Shelaḥ;
\v 13 and Arpakshad lived four hundred and three years after he brought forth Shelaḥ, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\p
\v 14 Shelaḥ lived thirty years, and brought forth Ever;
\v 15 and Shelaḥ lived four hundred and three years after he brought forth Ever, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\p
\v 16 Ever lived thirty-four years, and brought forth Peleg;
\v 17 and Ever lived four hundred and thirty years after he brought forth Peleg, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\p
\v 18 Peleg lived thirty years, and brought forth Reu;
\v 19 and Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he brought forth Reu, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\p
\v 20 Reu lived thirty-two years, and brought forth Serug;
\v 21 and Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he brought forth Serug, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\p
\v 22 Serug lived thirty years, and brought forth Naḥor;
\v 23 and Serug lived two hundred years after he brought forth Naḥor, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\p
\v 24 Naḥor lived twenty-nine years, and brought forth Teraḥ;
\v 25 and Naḥor lived one hundred and nineteen years after he brought forth Teraḥ, and he had \add other\add* sons and daughters.
\p
\v 26 Teraḥ lived seventy years, and brought forth Avram, Naḥor and Haran.
\p
\v 27 Now these are the generations of Teraḥ. Teraḥ brought forth Avram, Naḥor and Haran; and Haran brought forth Lot.
\v 28 Haran died in the presence of his father Teraḥ in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Kaldeans.
\v 29 Avram and Naḥor took wives for themselves. The name of Avram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Naḥor's wife was Milkah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milkah and Yiskah.
\v 30 Sarai was barren; she had no child.
\p
\v 31 Teraḥ took Avram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Avram's wife; and they went out together from Ur of the Kaldeans in order to enter the land of Kena'an; and they went as far as Ḥaran, and settled there.
\v 32 The days of Teraḥ were two hundred and five years; and Teraḥ died in Ḥaran.
\c 12
\ms פרשת לך-לך – Parashat Lekh-Lekha
\p
\v 1 And יהוה said to Avram, "Go forth from your country, and from your relatives and from your father's house, to the land which I will show you;
\p
\v 2 And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and so you shall be a blessing;
\p
\v 3 And I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed."
\p
\v 4 So Avram went forth as יהוה had spoken to him; and Lot went with him. Now Avram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Ḥaran.
\v 5 Avram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions which they had accumulated, and the beings which they had acquired in Ḥaran, and they set out for the land of Kena'an; thus they came to the land of Kena'an.
\v 6 Avram passed through the land as far as the site of Shekhem, to the oak of Moreh. Now the Kena'anite \add was\add* then in the land.
\v 7 יהוה appeared to Avram and said, "To your seed I will give this land." So he built an altar there to יהוה who had appeared to him.
\v 8 Then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-El, and pitched his tent, with Beth-El on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to יהוה and called upon the Name of יהוה.
\v 9 Avram journeyed on, continuing toward the Negev.
\p
\v 10 Now there was a famine in the land; so Avram went down to Mitsrayim to sojourn there, for the famine was heavy in the land.
\v 11 It came about when he came near to Mitsrayim, that he said to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman;
\v 12 and when the Mitsrites see you, they will say, 'This is his wife;" and they will kill me, but they will let you live.
\v 13 Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that my being may live on account of you."
\v 14 It came about when Avram came into Mitsrayim, the Mitsrites saw that the woman was very beautiful.
\v 15 Pharaoh's officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
\v 16 Therefore he treated Avram well for her sake; and gave him sheep and oxen and donkeys and male and female servants and female donkeys and camels.
\p
\v 17 But יהוה struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Avram's wife.
\v 18 Then Pharaoh called Avram and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
\v 19 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her and go."
\v 20 Pharaoh commanded \add his\add* men concerning him; and they escorted him away, with his wife and all that belonged to him.
\c 13 
\p
\v 1 So Avram went up from Mitsrayim to the Negev, he and his wife and all that belonged to him, and Lot with him.
\p
\v 2 Now Avram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold.
\v 3 He went on his journeys from the Negev as far as Beth-El, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-El and Ai,
\v 4 to the place of the altar which he had made there formerly; and there Avram called on the Name of יהוה.
\v 5 Now Lot, who went with Avram, also had flocks and herds and tents.
\v 6 And the land could not sustain them while dwelling together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to remain together.
\v 7 And there was strife between the herdsmen of Avram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. Now the Kena'anite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land.
\p
\v 8 So Avram said to Lot, "Please let there be no strife between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.
\v 9 Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me; if \add to\add* the left, then I will go to the right; or if \add to\add* the right, then I will go to the left."
\v 10 Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the valley of the Yarden, that it was well watered everywhere-- \add this was\add* before יהוה destroyed Sedom and Gomorrah-- like the garden of יהוה, like the land of Mitsrayim as you go to Tsoar.
\v 11 So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Yarden, and Lot journeyed eastward. Thus they separated from each other.
\v 12 Avram settled in the land of Kena'an, while Lot settled in the cities of the valley, and moved his tents as far as Sedom.
\v 13 Now the men of Sedom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against יהוה.
\p
\v 14 יהוה said to Avram, after Lot had separated from him, "Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;
\v 15 for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your seed forever.
\v 16 I will make your seed as the dust of the earth, so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your seed can also be numbered.
\v 17 Arise, walk about the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to you."
\v 18 Then Avram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Ḥevron, and there he built an altar to יהוה.
\c 14 
\p
\v 1 And it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Ariokh king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim,
\v 2 \add that\add* they made war with Bera king of Sedom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinav king of Admah, and Shemever king of Tsevoyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Tsoar).
\v 3 All these came as allies to the valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
\v 4 Twelve years they had served Kedorlaomer, but the thirteenth year they rebelled.
\v 5 In the fourteenth year Kedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim and the Zuzim in Ḥam and the Emim in Shaveh-Qiryathaim,
\v 6 and the Ḥorites in their Mount Seir, as far as El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
\v 7 Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Qadesh), and conquered all the country of the Amaleqites, and also the Amorites, who lived in Ḥatsatson-Tamar.
\v 8 And the king of Sedom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Tsevoyim and the king of Bela (that is, Tsoar) came out; and they arrayed for battle against them in the valley of Siddim,
\v 9 against Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goyim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Ariokh king of Ellasar-- four kings against five.
\v 10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sedom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell into them. But those who survived fled to the hill country.
\v 11 Then they took all the goods of Sedom and Gomorrah and all their food supply, and departed.
\v 12 They also took Lot, Avram's nephew, and his possessions and departed, for he was living in Sedom.
\p
\v 13 Then a fugitive came and told Avram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshkol and brother of Aner, and these were allies with Avram.
\v 14 When Avram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
\v 15 He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Ḥovah, which is north of Dammeseq.
\v 16 He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot with his possessions, and also the women, and the people.
\p
\v 17 Then after his return from the defeat of Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sedom went out to meet him at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
\v 18 And Malkitsedeq king of Salem brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of El Elyon.
\p
\v 19 He blessed him and said, "Blessed be Avram of El Elyon, Possessor of heavens and earth;
\p
\v 20 And blessed be El Elyon, who has delivered your enemies into your hand." He gave him a tenth of all.
\p
\v 21 The king of Sedom said to Avram, "Give the people to me and take the goods for yourself."
\v 22 Avram said to the king of Sedom, "I have sworn to יהוה El Elyon, possessor of heavens and earth,
\v 23 that I will not take a thread or a sandal thong or anything that is yours, for fear you would say, 'I have made Avram rich.'
\v 24 "I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre; let them take their share."
\c 15 
\p
\v 1 After these things the word of יהוה came to Avram in a vision, saying, "Do not fear, Avram, I am a shield to you; your reward shall be very great."
\p
\v 2 Avram said, "O Adonai יהוה, what will You give me, since I am childless, and the son-heir of my house is Eliezer of Dammeseq?"
\v 3 And Avram said, "Since You have given no seed to me, one born in my house is my heir."
\v 4 Then behold, the word of יהוה came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own gut, he shall be your heir."
\v 5 And He took him outside and said, "Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." And He said to him, "So shall your seed be."
\v 6 Then he believed in יהוה, and He reckoned it to him as righteousness.
\v 7 And He said to him, "I am יהוה who brought you out of Ur of the Kaldeans, to give you this land to possess it."
\v 8 He said, "O Adonai יהוה, how may I know that I will possess it?"
\v 9 And He said to him, "Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
\v 10 Then he brought all these to Him and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds.
\v 11 The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Avram drove them away.
\p
\v 12 Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Avram; and behold, terror \add and\add* great darkness fell upon him.
\v 13 And He said to Avram, "Know for certain that your seed will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years.
\v 14 But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions.
\v 15 As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age.
\v 16 Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete."
\p
\v 17 It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, \add there appeared\add* a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces.
\p
\v 18 On that day יהוה cut a covenant with Avram, saying, "To your seed I have given this land. From the river of Mitsrayim as far as the great river, the Perath River: \f + \fr 15:18 \ft Perath – The Euphrates River, and probably the etymological origin of the name.\f*
\p
\v 19 the Qenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite
\v 20 and the Ḥittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim
\v 21 and the Amorite and the Kena'anite and the Girgashite and the Yevusite."
\c 16 
\p
\v 1 And Sarai, Avram's wife had not brought forth any children to him, and she had a Mitsrite maid whose name was Hagar.
\v 2 And Sarai said to Avram, "Now behold, יהוה has prevented me from bearing \add children\add*. Please go in to my maid; perhaps I will obtain children through her." And Avram listened to the voice of Sarai.
\v 3 And Sarai the wife of Avram took Hagar the Mitsrite, her maid, after Avram had lived in the land of Kena'en ten years, and gave her to Avram her husband as his wife.
\v 4 And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
\v 5 And Sarai said to Avram, "May the wrong done me be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, but when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. May יהוה judge between you and me."
\v 6 But Avram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her what is good in your eyes." And Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence.
\p
\v 7 And the messenger of יהוה found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.
\v 8 And he said, "Hagar, Sarai's maid, where have you come from and where are you going?" And she said, "I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai."
\v 9 Then the messenger of יהוה said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit yourself to her authority."
\v 10 Moreover, the messenger of יהוה said to her, "I will greatly multiply your seed so that they will be too many to count."
\p
\v 11 And the messenger of יהוה said to her further, "Behold, you are with child, and you will bear a son; and you shall call his name Yishma'el, because יהוה has given heed to your affliction.
\v 12 And he will be a wild donkey of a man, his hand \add will be against\add* everyone, and everyone's hand \add will be against\add* him; and he will live before the face of all his brothers."
\p
\v 13 And she called the Name of יהוה who spoke to her, "You are El who sees;" for she said, "Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?"
\v 14 Therefore the well was called Beer-laḥai-roi; \f + \fr 16:14 \ft ( באר לחי ראי Beer-laḥai-roi) means "Well of the Living One Who sees me."\f* behold, it is between Qadesh and Bered.
\p
\v 15 And Hagar brought forth a son to Avram; and Avram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Yishma'el.
\v 16 And Avram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Yishma'el to him.
\p
\v 17 And when Avram was ninety-nine years old, יהוה appeared to Avram and said to him, "I am El Shaddai; walk before Me, and be blameless.
\v 2 And I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply you exceedingly."
\v 3 And Avram fell on his face, and Elohim talked with him, saying,
\v 4 "\add As for\add* Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you will be the father of a multitude of nations.
\p
\v 5 "No longer shall your name be called Avram, \f + \fr 17:5 \fk אברם (Avram): \ft means "exalted father"\f* but your name shall be Avraham; \f + \fr 17:5 \fk אברהם (Avraham): \ft means "father of multitude."\f* and I will make you the father of a multitude of nations.
\p
\v 6 "And I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come forth from you.
\v 7 And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be Elohim to you and to your seed after you.
\v 8 I will give to you and to your seed after you, the land of your sojourning, all the land of Kena'an, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their Elohim."
\p
\v 9 And Elohim \add further\add* said to Avraham, "Now as for you, you shall guard My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations.
\v 10 This is My covenant, which you shall guard, between Me and you and your seed after you: every male among you shall be circumcised.
\v 11 And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.
\v 12 And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, a \add servant\add* who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your seed.
\v 13 A \add servant\add* who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall surely be circumcised; thus shall My covenant be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
\v 14 But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that being shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant."
\p
\v 15 And Elohim said to Avraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah \add shall be\add* her name.
\v 16 And I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be \add a mother\add* of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."
\v 17 And Avraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, "Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bring forth?"
\v 18 And Avraham said to Elohim, "Oh that Yishma'el might live before You!"
\v 19 But Elohim said, "No, but Sarah your wife will bring forth a son to you, and you shall call his name Yitsḥaq; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.
\v 20 And as for Yishma'el, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall bring forth twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation.
\v 21 But My covenant I will establish with Yitsḥaq, whom Sarah will bring forth to you at this appointed time next year."
\v 22 And when He finished speaking with him, Elohim went up from Avraham.
\p
\v 23 And Avraham took Yishma'el his son, and all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his silver, every male among the men of Avraham's household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the very same day, as Elohim had said to him.
\v 24 Now Avraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
\v 25 And Yishma'el his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
\v 26 In the very same day Avraham was circumcised, and Yishma'el his son.
\v 27 And all the men of his household, who were born in the house or bought with silver from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

\ms פרשת וירא – Parashat Vayeira
\p
\v 1 And יהוה appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day.
\v 2 And when he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth,
\v 3 and said, "יהוה if now I have found favor in Your eyes, please do not pass Your servant by.
\v 4 Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree;
\v 5 and I will bring a piece of bread, that you may sustain your hearts; after that you may go on, since you have visited your servant." And they said, "So do, as you have said."
\v 6 And Avraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead \add it\add* and make bread cakes."
\v 7 And Avraham also ran to the herd, and took a tender and choice calf and gave \add it\add* to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it.
\v 8 And he took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and placed \add it\add* before them; and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate.
\p
\v 9 And they said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, "There, in the tent."
\v 10 And He said, "I will surely return to you at this time of life; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him.
\v 11 Now Avraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing.
\v 12 And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my master being old also?"
\v 13 And יהוה said to Avraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I indeed bring forth, when I am old?'
\v 14 Is \add any\add* thing too extraordinary for יהוה? At the appointed time I will return to you, at the time of life, and Sarah will have a son."
\v 15 But Sarah denied \add it\add* however, saying, "I did not laugh;" for she was afraid. And He said, "Not so, for you did laugh."
\p
\v 16 And the men rose up from there, and looked down toward Sedom; and Avraham was walking with them to send them off.
\v 17 And יהוה said, "Shall I hide from Avraham what I am about to do,
\v 18 since Avraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed?
\v 19 For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to guard the way of יהוה by doing righteousness and judgment, so that יהוה may bring upon Avraham what He has spoken about him."
\v 20 And יהוה said, "The outcry of Sedom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is very heavy.
\v 21 I will go down now, and see if they have done enitrely according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know."
\p
\v 22 And the men turned away from there and went toward Sedom, while Avraham was still standing before יהוה.
\v 23 And Avraham came near and said, "Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
\v 24 Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed sweep \add it\add* away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?
\v 25 Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked become alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth work judgment?"
\v 26 And יהוה said, "If I find in Sedom fifty righteous ones within the city, then I will spare the whole place on their account."
\v 27 And Avraham replied, "Now behold, I have ventured to speak unto יהוה, although I am \add but\add* dust and ashes.
\v 28 Suppose the fifty righteous ones are lacking five, will You destroy the whole city because of five?" And He said, "I will not destroy \add it\add* if I find forty-five there."
\v 29 He spoke to Him yet again and said, "Suppose forty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do \add it\add* on account of the forty."
\v 30 And he said, "Oh may יהוה not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do \add it\add* if I find thirty there."
\v 31 And he said, "Now behold, I have ventured to speak to יהוה; suppose twenty are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy \add it\add* on account of the twenty."
\v 32 Then he said, "Oh may יהוה not be angry, and I shall speak only this once; suppose ten are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy \add it\add* on account of the ten."
\v 33 As soon as He had finished speaking to Avraham, יהוה departed and Avraham returned to his place.

\p
\v 1 And two messengers came to Sedom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sedom. When Lot saw \add them\add*, he rose to meet them and bowed facedown to the ground.
\v 2 And he said, "Now behold, my masters, please turn aside into your servant's house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way." They said however, "No, but we shall spend the night in the square."
\v 3 And he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a banquet for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
\p
\v 4 Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sedom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;
\v 5 and they called to Lot and said to him, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them."
\v 6 But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him,
\v 7 and said, "Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.
\v 8 Now behold, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do nothing to these men, as they have come under the shelter of my roof."
\v 9 But they said, "Stand aside." Furthermore, they said, "This one came in as a sojourner, and in judging, you judge; now we will treat you worse than them." So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door.
\v 10 But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
\v 11 And they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied \add themselves trying\add* to find the doorway.
\p
\v 12 And the men said to Lot, "Whom else have you here? A son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring \add them\add* out of the place;
\v 13 for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before יהוה that יהוה has sent us to destroy it."
\v 14 Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, and said, "Up, get out of this place, for יהוה will destroy the city." But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be joking.
\p
\v 15 When dawn arose, the messengers urged Lot, saying, "Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the iniquity of the city."
\v 16 But he hesitated. So the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, for the compassion of יהוה \add was\add* upon him; and they brought him out, and put him outside the city.
\v 17 And it came about, when they had brought them outside, one said, "Escape for your being! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the valley; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away."
\v 18 But Lot said to them, "Oh no, יהוה!
\v 19 Now behold, your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have magnified your loving-kindness, which you have shown me by saving my being; but I cannot escape to the mountains, for some evil will overtake me and I will die;
\v 20 now behold, this town is near \add enough\add* to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) that my being may be saved."
\v 21 He said to him, "Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken.
\v 22 Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there." Therefore the name of the city was called Tsoar. \f + \fr 19:22 \fk צער (tso'ar): \ft Hebrew word meaning "little" or "insignificant."\f*
\p
\v 23 The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Tsoar.
\v 24 Then יהוה rained on Sedom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from יהוה out of the heavens,
\v 25 and He overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
\v 26 But his wife, from behind him, looked \add back\add*, and she became a pillar of salt.
\p
\v 27 And Avraham arose early in the morning \add and went\add* to the place where he had stood before יהוה;
\v 28 and he looked down toward the face of Sedom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace.
\p
\v 29 And it came about, when Elohim destroyed the cities of the valley, that Elohim remembered Avraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
\p
\v 30 And Lot went up from Tsoar, and stayed in the mountains, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to stay in Tsoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters.
\v 31 And the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth.
\v 32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him that we may preserve the seed of our father."
\v 33 And they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
\v 34 And it came about, on the next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve the seed of our father."
\v 35 And they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
\v 36 And both the daughters of Lot conceived by their father.
\v 37 The firstborn brought forth a son, and called his name Moav; \f + \fr 19:37 \fk מואב (mo'av): \ft means "from father."\f* he is the father of the Moavites to this day.
\v 38 As for the younger, she also brought forth a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; \f + \fr 19:38 \fk בן עמי (Ben-ammi): \ft means "son of my people."\f* he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.

\p
\v 1 And Avraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negev, and settled between Qadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar.
\v 2 And Avraham said of Sarah his wife, "She \add is\add* my sister." So Avimelekh king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
\v 3 But Elohim came to Avimelekh in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Behold, you are \add a\add* dead \add man\add*; for the woman whom you have taken: for she is married."
\v 4 But Avimelekh had not come near her; and he said, "יהוה, will You slay a righteous nation?
\v 5 Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister'? And even she said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this."
\v 6 Then Elohim said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.
\v 7 And now therefore, restore the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore \add her\add*, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours."
\p
\v 8 And Avimelekh arose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were greatly frightened.
\v 9 And  Avimelekh called Avraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done."
\v 10 And Avimelekh said to Avraham, "What have you encountered, that you have done this thing?"
\v 11 And Avraham said, "Because I thought, 'surely there is no fear of Elohim in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'
\v 12 Still, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
\v 13 And it came about, when Elohim caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is the loving-kindness which you will show to me: everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"
\v 14 And Avimelekh then took sheep and oxen and male and female servants, and gave them to Avraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him.
\v 15 And Avimelekh said, "Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please."
\v 16 And to Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand \add pieces\add* of silver; behold, it is your vindication before all who are with you, and before all men you are vindicated."
\v 17 And Avraham prayed to Elohim, and Elohim healed Avimelekh and his wife and his maids, so that they could bring forth.
\v 18 For יהוה had completely shut all the wombs of the household of Avimelekh because of Sarah, Avraham's wife.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 And יהוה visited Sarah as He had said, and יהוה did for Sarah as He had promised.
\v 2 And Sarah conceived and brought forth a son to Avraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which Elohim had spoken to him.
\v 3 And Avraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Yitsḥaq. \f + \fr 21:3 \fk יצחק (Yitsḥaq): \ft means "he laughs."\f*
\v 4 And Avraham circumcised his son Yitsḥaq when he was eight days old, as Elohim had commanded him.
\v 5 And Avraham was one hundred years old when his son Yitsḥaq was born to him.
\v 6 And Sarah said, "Elohim has made laughter for me; all who hear will laugh with me."
\v 7 And she said, "Who would have said to Avraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have brought forth a son to him in his old age."
\p
\v 8 And the child grew and was weaned, and Avraham made a great banquet on the day that Yitsḥaq was weaned.
\p
\v 9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Mitsrite, whom she had borne to Avraham, mocking.
\v 10 And she said to Avraham, "Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Yitsḥaq."
\v 11 And the matter distressed Avraham greatly because of his son.
\v 12 But Elohim said to Avraham, "Do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Yitsḥaq your seed shall be named.
\v 13 And of the son of the maid I will make a nation also, because he is your seed."
\v 14 And Avraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave \add them\add* to Hagar, putting \add them\add* on her shoulder, and \add gave her\add* the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheva.
\p
\v 15 And when the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes.
\v 16 And she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, "Do not let me see the boy die." And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and she \f + \fr 21:16 \ft LXX reads, "and the child wept."\f* wept.
\v 17 Elohim heard the lad crying; and the messenger of Elohim called to Hagar from the heavens and said to her, "What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for Elohim has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
\v 18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him."
\v 19 And Elohim opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink.
\p
\v 20 And Elohim was with the lad, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer.
\v 21 And he lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 22 And it came about at that time that Avimelekh and Pikhol, the commander of his army, spoke to Avraham, saying, "Elohim is with you in all that you do;
\v 23 now therefore, swear to me here by Elohim that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but according to the loving-kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have sojourned."
\v 24 And Avraham said, "I swear it."
\v 25 But Avraham complained to Avimelekh on account of the well of water which the servants of Avimelekh had seized.
\v 26 And Avimelekh said, "I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today."
\p
\v 27 And Avraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Avimelekh, and the two of them cut a covenant.
\v 28 And Avraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
\v 29 And Avimelekh said to Avraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?"
\v 30 And he said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well."
\v 31 Therefore he called that place Beersheva, because there the two of them took an oath.
\v 32 And they cut a covenant at Beersheva; and Avimelekh and Pikhol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines.
\v 33 And he planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheva, and there he called on the Name of יהוה, the Everlasting El.
\v 34 And Avraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 And it came about after these things, that Elohim tested Avraham, and said to him, "Avraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
\v 2 And He said, "Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Yitsḥaq, and go to the land of Moriyah, and offer him there as an ascension offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you."
\p
\v 3 And Avraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Yitsḥaq his son; and he split wood for the ascension offering, and arose and went to the place of which Elohim had told him.
\v 4 On the third day Avraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance.
\v 5 And Avraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go over there, and we will bow down, and return to you."
\v 6 And Avraham took the wood of the ascension offering and laid it on Yitsḥaq his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.
\v 7 And Yitsḥaq spoke to Avraham his father and said, "My father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." And he said, "Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the ascension offering?"
\v 8 And Avraham said, "Elohim will provide for Himself the lamb for the ascension offering, my son." So the two of them walked on together.
\p
\v 9 And they came to the place of which Elohim had told him; and Avraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his son Yitsḥaq and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
\v 10 And Avraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
\v 11 But the messenger of יהוה called to him from the heavens and said, "Avraham, Avraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
\v 12 And He said, "Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear Elohim, since you have not withheld your only son from Me."
\v 13 And Avraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, a ram [behind him] \f + \fr 22:13 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading not present in the DSS, LXX, and the Syr. but present in the Heb. MT, Sam., and Lat..\f* caught in the thicket by his horns; and Avraham went and took the ram and offered him up for an ascension offering in the place of his son.
\v 14 Avraham called the name of that place יהוה Yireh, \f + \fr 22:14 \fk יראה (yireh): \ft Hebrew word meaning "it will be provided." The title יהוה יראה means "יהוה will provide."\f* as it is said to this day, "In the mount of יהוה it will be provided."\f*
\p
\v 15 Then the messenger of יהוה called to Avraham a second time from the heavens,
\v 16 and said, "By Myself I have sworn, declares יהוה, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son,
\v 17 indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies.
\v 18 And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice."
\v 19 And Avraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheva; and Avraham lived at Beersheva.
\p
\v 20 And it came about after these things, that it was told Avraham, saying, "Behold, Milkah also has borne children to your brother Naḥor:
\v 21 Uts his firstborn and Buz his brother and Qemu'el the father of Aram
\v 22 and Kesed and Ḥazo and Pildash and Yidlaph and Bethu'el."
\v 23 Bethu'el brought forth Rivqah; these eight Milkah bore to Naḥor, Avraham's brother.
\v 24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebaḥ and Gaḥam and Taḥash and Ma'akah.

\ms פרשת חיי שרה – Parashat Ḥaiyei Sarah
\p
\v 1 And Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; \add these were\add* the years of the life of Sarah.
\v 2 And Sarah died in Qiryath-arba (that is, Ḥevron) in the land of Kena'an; and Avraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
\v 3 And Avraham rose from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Ḥeth, saying,
\v 4 "I am a sojourner and a guest among you; give me a burial site among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
\v 5 And the sons of Ḥeth answered Avraham, saying to him,
\v 6 "Hear us, my master, you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead."
\v 7 And Avraham rose and bowed to the people of the land, the sons of Ḥeth.
\v 8 And he spoke with them, saying, "If the \add desire of your\add* being is \add for me\add* to bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and approach Ephron the son of Tsoḥar for me,
\v 9 that he may give me the cave of Makhpelah which he owns, which is at the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in your presence for a burial site."
\p
\v 10 And Ephron was sitting among the sons of Ḥeth; and Ephron the Ḥittite answered Avraham in the hearing of the sons of Ḥeth; \add even\add* of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,
\v 11 "No, my master, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead."
\v 12 And Avraham bowed before the people of the land.
\v 13 And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, "If you will only please listen to me; I will give the price of the field, accept \add it\add* from me that I may bury my dead there."
\v 14 And Ephron answered Avraham, saying to him,
\v 15 "My master, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred sheqels of silver, what is that between me and you? So bury your dead."
\v 16 And Avraham listened to Ephron; and Avraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Ḥeth, four hundred sheqels of silver, current money.
\p
\v 17 And Ephron's field, which was in Makhpelah, which faced Mamre, the field and cave which was in it, and all the trees which were in the field, that were within all the confines of its border, were deeded over
\v 18 to Avraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Ḥeth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
\v 19 And after this, Avraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Makhpelah facing Mamre (that is, Ḥevron) in the land of Kena'an.
\v 20 And the field and the cave that is in it, were deeded over to Avraham for a burial site by the sons of Ḥeth.
\p
\v 24 And Avraham was old, advanced in years; and יהוה had blessed Avraham in every way.
\v 2 And Avraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, "Please place your hand under my thigh,
\v 3 and I will make you swear by יהוה, the Elohim of the heavens and the Elohim of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Kena'anites, among whom I live,
\v 4 but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Yitsḥaq."
\v 5 And the servant said to him, "Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?"
\v 6 And Avraham said to him, "Beware that you do not take my son back there!
\v 7 יהוה, Elohim of the heavens, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, 'To your seed I will give this land,' He will send His messenger before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.
\v 8 But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only do not take my son back there."
\v 9 And the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Avraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
\p
\v 10 And the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and set out with a variety of good things of his master's in his hand; and he arose and went to Aram-Naharayim, to the city of Naḥor.
\v 11 And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water.
\v 12 And he said, "O יהוה, the Elohim of my master Avraham, please grant me success today, and show loving-kindness to my master Avraham.
\v 13 Behold, I am standing by the spring, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;
\v 14 and may it come about that the girl to whom I say, 'Please let down your jar so that I may drink,' and who answers, 'Drink, and I will water your camels also-- \add may\add* she \add be the one\add* whom You have appointed for Your servant Yitsḥaq; and by this I will know that You have shown loving-kindness to my master."
\p
\v 15 And it came about, before he had finished speaking, behold, Rivqah who was born to Bethu'el the son of Milkah, the wife of Avraham's brother Naḥor, came out with her jar on her shoulder.
\v 16 And the girl was very beautiful, a virgin, and no man had known her; and she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.
\v 17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar."
\v 18 And she said, "Drink, my master;" and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink.
\v 19 And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will draw also for your camels until they have finished drinking."
\v 20 And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.
\v 21 And the man gazed at her in silence, to know whether יהוה had made his journey successful or not.
\p
\v 22 And when the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half-sheqel and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten sheqels in gold,
\v 23 and said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room for us to lodge in your father's house?"
\v 24 And she said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethu'el, the son of Milkah, whom she bore to Naḥor."
\v 25 And \add again\add* she said to him, "We have plenty of both straw and feed, and room to lodge in."
\v 26 And the man stooped low and bowed down to יהוה.
\v 27 And he said, "Blessed be יהוה, the Elohim of my master Avraham, who has not forsaken His loving-kindness and His truth toward my master; as for me, יהוה has guided me in the way to the house of my master's brothers."
\p
\v 28 And the girl ran and told her mother's household about these things.
\v 29 And Rivqah had a brother whose name was Lavan; and Lavan ran outside to the man at the spring.
\v 30 And when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's wrists, and when he heard the words of Rivqah his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me," he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
\v 31 And he said, "Come in, blessed of יהוה! Why do you stand outside since I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels?"
\p
\v 32 And the man entered the house. Then Lavan unloaded the camels, and he gave straw and feed to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
\v 33 But when \add food\add* was set before him to eat, he said, "I will not eat until I have told my business." And he said, "Speak on."
\v 34 And he said, "I am Avraham's servant.
\v 35 And יהוה has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys.
\v 36 And Sarah my master's wife brought forth a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has.
\v 37 My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Kena'anites, in whose land I live;
\v 38 but you shall go to my father's house and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.'
\v 39 And I said to my master, 'Suppose the woman does not follow me.'
\v 40 And he said to me, 'יהוה, before whom I have walked, will send His messenger with you to make your journey successful, and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father's house;
\v 41 then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'
\p
\v 42 "And I came today to the spring, and said, 'O יהוה, the Elohim of my master Avraham, if now You will make my journey on which I go successful;
\v 43 behold, I am standing by the spring, and may it be that the maiden who comes out to draw, and to whom I say, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar;"
\v 44 and she will say to me, "You drink, and I will draw for your camels also;" let her be the woman whom יהוה has appointed for my master's son.'
\p
\v 45 "Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rivqah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew, and I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
\v 46 And she quickly lowered her jar from her \add shoulder\add*, and said, 'Drink, and I will water your camels also'; so I drank, and she watered the camels also.
\v 47 And I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' And she said, 'The daughter of Bethu'el, Naḥor's son, whom Milkah bore to him'; and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.
\v 48 And I stooped low and bowed down to יהוה, and blessed יהוה, the Elohim of my master Avraham, who had guided me in the true way to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
\v 49 And now if you are going to deal with my master in loving-kindness and truth, tell me; and if not, let me know, that I may turn to the right hand or the left."
\p
\v 50 And Lavan and Bethu'el replied, "The matter comes from יהוה; we cannot speak to you bad or good.
\v 51 Here is Rivqah before you, take \add her\add* and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as יהוה has spoken."
\p
\v 52 And when Avraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before יהוה.
\v 53 And the servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rivqah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.
\v 54 And he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they arose in the morning, he said, "Send me away to my master."
\v 55 But her brother and her mother said, "Let the girl stay with us \add a few\add* days, say ten; afterward she may go."
\v 56 And he said to them, "Do not delay me, since יהוה has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."
\v 57 And they said, "We will call the girl and inquire of her mouth \add her desire\add*."
\v 58 And they called Rivqah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go."
\v 59 And they sent away their sister Rivqah and her nurse with Avraham's servant and his men.
\p
\v 60 And they blessed Rivqah and said to her, "May you, our sister, become thousands of ten thousands, and may your seed possess the gate \f + \fr 24:60 \ft Possess the gate – Idiom meaning "capture the city."\f* of those who hate them."
\p
\v 61 And Rivqah arose with her maids, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rivqah and departed.
\p
\v 62 And Yitsḥaq had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the Negev.
\v 63 And Yitsḥaq went out to meditate \f + \fr 24:63 \ft Syr. reads, "went out to stroll."\f* in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming.
\v 64 And Rivqah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Yitsḥaq she dismounted from the camel.
\v 65 And she said to the servant, "Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?" And the servant said, "He is my master." Then she took her veil and covered herself.
\v 66 And the servant told Yitsḥaq all the things that he had done.
\v 67 And Yitsḥaq brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and he took Rivqah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; thus Yitsḥaq was comforted after his mother's death.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 And Avraham took another wife, whose name was Qeturah.
\v 2 And she brought forth to him Zimran and Yoqshan and Medan and Midian and Yishbaq and Shuah.
\v 3 And Yoqshan brought forth Sheva and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Ashuwrim and Letushim and Leummim.
\v 4 And the sons of Midian \add were\add* Ephah and Epher and Ḥanokh and Avida and Elda'ah. All these \add were\add* the sons of Qeturah.
\v 5 And Avraham gave all that he had to Yitsḥaq;
\v 6 but to the sons of his concubines, Avraham gave gifts while he was still living, and sent them away from his son Yitsḥaq eastward, to the land of the east.
\p
\v 7 These are all the years of Avraham's life that he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years.
\v 8 Avraham breathed his last and died in a ripe old age, an old man and satisfied \add with life\add*; and he was gathered to his people.
\v 9 And his sons Yitsḥaq and Yishma'el buried him in the cave of Makhpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Tsoḥar the Ḥittite, facing Mamre,
\v 10 the field which Avraham purchased from the sons of Ḥeth; there Avraham was buried with Sarah his wife.
\v 11 And it came about after the death of Avraham, that Elohim blessed his son Yitsḥaq; and Yitsḥaq lived by Beer-lahai-roi.
\p
\v 12 And these are the generations of Yishma'el, Avraham's son, whom Hagar the Mitsrite, Sarah's maid, brought forth to Avraham;
\v 13 and these are the names of the sons of Yishma'el, by their names, in the order of their birth: Nevaioth, the firstborn of Yishma'el, and Kedar and Adbe'el and Mivsam
\v 14 and Mishma and Dumah and Massa,
\v 15 Ḥadad and Tema, Yetur, Naphish and Qedemah.
\v 16 And these are the sons of Yishma'el and these are their names, by their villages, and by their camps; twelve chiefs according to their tribes.
\v 17 These are the years of the life of Yishma'el, one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.
\v 18 They settled from Ḥavilah to Shur which is east of Mitsrayim as one goes toward Ashuwr; he settled in defiance of all his relatives.
\ms פרשת תולדת – Parashat Toldot
\p
\v 19 And these are the generations of Yitsḥaq, Avraham's son: Avraham brought forth Yitsḥaq;
\v 20 and Yitsḥaq was forty years old when he took Rivqah, the daughter of Bethu'el the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Lavan the Aramean, to be his wife.
\v 21 And Yitsḥaq prayed to יהוה on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and יהוה answered him and Rivqah his wife conceived.
\v 22 But the children struggled together within her; and she said, "If it is so, why then am I \add this way\add*?" So she went to inquire of יהוה.
\p
\v 23 And יהוה said to her, "Two nations are in your womb; and two peoples will be separated from your gut; and one people shall be stronger than the other; and the older shall serve the younger."
\p
\v 24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
\v 25 And the first came forth ruddy, \add and\add* hairy all over like a garment; and they named him Esaw. \f + \fr 25:25 \fk עשו \ft (es'aw) is derived from the Hebrew root word עשה (as'ah) meaning "rough."\f*
\v 26 And then his brother came forth with his hand holding on to Esaw's heel, so his name was called Ya'aqov; \f + \fr 25:26 \ft Typically translated as "supplanter," יעקב (ya'aqov) literally means "heel-catcher" or "the one who grasps the heel." Some Jewish writings state he was born with his hand on Esaw's heel because Esaw attempted to crush his head.\f* and Yitsḥaq was sixty years old when she brought them forth.
\p
\v 27 And when the boys grew up, Esaw became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, but Ya'aqov was a complete man, living in tents.
\v 28 And Yitsḥaq loved Esaw, because he had a taste for game, but Rivqah loved Ya'aqov.
\v 29 And when Ya'aqov had cooked stew, Esaw came in from the field and he was faint;
\v 30 and Esaw said to Ya'aqov, "Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom. \f + \fr 25:30 \fk אדום (ed'owm): \ft From the Hebrew word אדם (ad'owm) meaning "red."\f*
\v 31 But Ya'aqov said, "Sell your birthright to me today."
\v 32 And Esaw said, "Behold, I am about to die; so of what \add use\add* then is the birthright to me?"
\v 33 And Ya'aqov said, "Swear to me today;" so he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Ya'aqov.
\v 34 And Ya'aqov gave Esaw bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way. Thus Esaw despised his birthright.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 And there was a famine in the land, besides the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Avraham. So Yitsḥaq went to Gerar, to Avimelekh king of the Philistines.
\v 2 And יהוה appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Mitsrayim; stay in the land of which I shall tell you.
\v 3 Sojourn in this land and I will be with you and bless you, for to you and to your seed I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to your father Avraham.
\v 4 And I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and will give your seed all these lands; and by your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;
\v 5 because Avraham obeyed Me and guarded My charge, My commands, My statutes and My Torot."
\p
\v 6 And Yitsḥaq lived in Gerar.
\v 7 And when the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "my wife," thinking, "the men of the place might kill me on account of Rivqah, for she is beautiful."
\v 8 And it came about, when he had been there a long time, that Avimelekh king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw, and behold, Yitsḥaq was caressing his wife Rivqah.
\v 9 And Avimelekh called Yitsḥaq and said, "Behold, certainly she is your wife! How then did you say, 'She is my sister?" And Yitsḥaq said to him, "Because I said, 'I might die on account of her.'"
\v 10 And Avimelekh said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
\v 11 And Avimelekh charged all the people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
\p
\v 12 And Yitsḥaq sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. And יהוה blessed him,
\v 13 and the man became rich, and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy;
\v 14 and he had possessions of flocks and herds and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him.
\v 15 And all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Avraham his father, the Philistines stopped up by filling them with earth.
\v 16 And Avimelekh said to Yitsḥaq, "Go away from us, for you are too vast for us."
\v 17 And Yitsḥaq departed from there and camped in the wadi of Gerar, and settled there.
\p
\v 18 And Yitsḥaq dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Avraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Avraham; and he gave them the same names which his father had given them.
\v 19 But when Yitsḥaq's servants dug in the wadi and found there a well of flowing water,
\v 20 the shepherds of Gerar strove with the shepherds of Yitsḥaq, saying, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Eseq, because they contended with him.
\v 21 And they dug another well, and they quarreled over it too, so he named it Sitnah.
\v 22 And he moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he named it Reḥovoth, for he said, "At last יהוה has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land."
\p
\v 23 And he went up from there to Beersheva.
\p
\v 24 And יהוה appeared to him the same night and said, "I am the Elohim of your father Avraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you, and multiply your seed, for the sake of My servant Avraham."
\p
\v 25 And he built an altar there and called upon the Name of יהוה, and pitched his tent there; and there Yitsḥaq's servants dug a well.
\p
\v 26 And Avimelekh came to him from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath and Pikhol the commander of his army.
\v 27 And Yitsḥaq said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?"
\v 28 And they said, "We see plainly that יהוה has been with you; so we said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between you and us, and let us cut a covenant with you,
\v 29 that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of יהוה.'"
\v 30 And he made them a banquet, and they ate and drank.
\v 31 And they arose early in the morning, and exchanged oaths; then Yitsḥaq sent them away and they departed from him in peace.
\v 32 And it came to be on the same day, that Yitsḥaq's servants came in and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water."
\v 33 And he called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheva to this day.
\p
\v 34 And when Esaw was forty years old he married Yehudith the daughter of Beeri the Ḥittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Ḥittite;
\v 35 and they brought grief to Yitsḥaq and Rivqah.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 And it came about, when Yitsḥaq was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called his older son Esaw and said to him, "My son." And he said to him, "Here I am."
\v 2 And Yitsḥaq said, "Behold now, I am old and I do not know the day of my death.
\v 3 And now, therefore, please take your gear, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me;
\v 4 and prepare a savory dish for me such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my being may bless you before I die."
\p
\v 5 And Rivqah was listening while Yitsḥaq spoke to his son Esaw. So when Esaw went to the field to hunt for game to bring home,
\v 6 and Rivqah said to her son Ya'aqov, "Behold, I heard your father speak to your brother Esaw, saying,
\v 7 'Bring me some game and prepare a savory dish for me, that I may eat, and bless you in the presence of יהוה before my death.'
\v 8 And now therefore, my son, listen to me as I command you.
\v 9 Go now to the flock and bring me two choice young goats from there, that I may prepare them as a savory dish for your father, such as he loves.
\v 10 And you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death."
\v 11 And Ya'aqov answered his mother Rivqah, "Behold, Esaw my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man.
\v 12 Perhaps my father will feel me, then I will be as a deceiver in his eyes, and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing."
\v 13 But his mother said to him, "Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me."
\v 14 And he went and got them, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savory food such as his father loved.
\v 15 And Rivqah took the best garments of Esaw her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Ya'aqov her younger son.
\v 16 And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
\v 17 She also gave the savory food and the bread, which she had made, to her son Ya'aqov.
\p
\v 18 And he came to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"
\v 19 And Ya'aqov said to his father, "I am Esaw your firstborn; I have done as you told me. Get up, please, sit and eat of my game, that you may bless me."
\v 20 And Yitsḥaq said to his son, "How is it that you have it so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Because יהוה your Elohim caused it to happen to me."
\v 21 And Yitsḥaq said to Ya'aqov, "Please come close, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esaw or not."
\v 22 So Ya'aqov came close to Yitsḥaq his father, and he felt him and said, "The voice is the voice of Ya'aqov, but the hands are the hands of Esaw."
\v 23 He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esaw's hands; so he blessed him.
\v 24 And he said, "Are you really my son Esaw?" And he said, "I am."
\v 25 So he said, "Bring it to me, and I will eat of my son's game, that I may bless you." And he brought it to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine and he drank.
\v 26 And his father Yitsḥaq said to him, "Please come close and kiss me, my son."
\p
\v 27 So he came close and kissed him; and when he smelled the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said, "See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which יהוה has blessed;
\v 28 and may Elohim give you of the dew of the heavens, and of the fatness of the earth, and an abundance of grain and new wine;
\v 29 May peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you; be master of your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, and blessed be those who bless you."
\p
\v 30 And it came about, as soon as Yitsḥaq had finished blessing Ya'aqov, and Ya'aqov had hardly gone out from the presence of Yitsḥaq his father, that Esaw his brother came in from his hunting.
\v 31 And he also made savory food, and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, "Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me."
\v 32 Yitsḥaq his father said to him, "Who are you?" And he said, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esaw."
\v 33 And Yitsḥaq trembled violently, and said, "Who was he then that hunted game and brought it to me, so that I ate of all of it before you came, and blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed."
\v 34 When Esaw heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, O my father!"
\v 35 And he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing."
\v 36 And he said, "Is he not rightly named Ya'aqov, for he has supplanted me these two times? He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing." And he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"
\v 37 But Yitsḥaq replied to Esaw, "Behold, I have made him your master, and all his relatives I have given to him as servants; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. Now as for you then, what can I do, my son?"
\v 38 Esaw said to his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father." So Esaw lifted his voice and wept.
\p
\v 39 And Yitsḥaq his father answered and said to him, "Behold, away from the fertility of the earth shall be your dwelling, and away from the dew of the heavens from above.
\v 40 By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but it shall come about when you become restless, that you will break his yoke from your neck."
\p
\v 41 So Esaw bore a grudge against Ya'aqov because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esaw said in his heart, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Ya'aqov."
\v 42 And when the words of her elder son Esaw were reported to Rivqah, she sent and called her younger son Ya'aqov, and said to him, "Behold your brother Esaw is consoling himself concerning you by planning to kill you.
\v 43 And now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee to Ḥaran, to my brother Lavan!
\v 44 Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury subsides,
\v 45 until your brother's anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. And I will send and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
\p
\v 46 And Rivqah said to Yitsḥaq, "I abhor my life because of the daughters of Ḥeth; if Ya'aqov takes a wife from the daughters of Ḥeth, like these, from the daughters of the land, what will my life be to me?"
\c 28
\p
\v 1 And Yitsḥaq called Ya'aqov and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Kena'an.
\v 2 Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethu'el your mother's father; and from there take to yourself a wife from the daughters of Lavan your mother's brother.
\v 3 May El Shaddai bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become an assembly of peoples.
\v 4 May He also give you the blessing of Avraham, to you and to your seed with you, that you may possess the land of your sojournings, which Elohim gave to Avraham."
\v 5 And Yitsḥaq sent Ya'aqov away, and he went to Paddan-aram to Lavan, son of Bethu'el the Aramean, the brother of Rivqah, the mother of Ya'aqov and Esaw.
\p
\v 6 Now Esaw saw that Yitsḥaq had blessed Ya'aqov and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take to himself a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he charged him, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Kena'an,"
\v 7 and that Ya'aqov had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram.
\v 8 So Esaw saw that the daughters of Kena'an displeased his father Yitsḥaq;
\v 9 and Esaw went to Yishma'el, and married, besides the wives that he had, Maḥalath the daughter of Yishma'el, Avraham's son, the sister of Nevaioth.
\ms פרשת ויצא – Parashat Vayetse
\p
\v 10 And Ya'aqov went out from Beersheva and went toward Ḥaran.
\v 11 He came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it at his head, and lay down in that place.
\v 12 He had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to the heavens; and behold, the messengers of Elohim were ascending and descending on it.
\v 13 And behold, יהוה stood above it and said, "I am יהוה, the Elohim of your father Avraham and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq; the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your seed.
\v 14 And your seed will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
\v 15 Behold, I am with you and will guard you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
\v 16 And Ya'aqov awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely יהוה is in this place, and I did not know it."
\v 17 He was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of Elohim, and this is the gate of the heavens."
\p
\v 18 So Ya'aqov rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on its top.
\v 19 He called the name of that place Beth-El; however, previously the name of the city had been Luz.
\v 20 And Ya'aqov made a vow, saying, "If Elohim will be with me and will guard me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and garments to wear,
\v 21 and I return to my father's house in safety, then יהוה will be my Elohim.
\v 22 This stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be the house of Elohim, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You."
\c 29
\p
\v 1 And Ya'aqov went on his journey, and came to the land of the sons of the east.
\v 2 He looked, and saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, for from that well they watered the flocks. Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large.
\v 3 When all the flocks were gathered there, they would then roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well.
\p
\v 4 Ya'aqov said to them, "My brothers, where are you from?" And they said, "We are from Ḥaran."
\v 5 He said to them, "Do you know Lavan the son of Naḥor?" And they said, "We know him."
\v 6 And he said to them, "Is it well with him?" And they said, "It is well, and here is Raḥeil his daughter coming with the sheep."
\v 7 He said, "Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them."
\v 8 But they said, "We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep."
\p
\v 9 While he was still speaking with them, Raḥeil came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
\v 10 When Ya'aqov saw Raḥeil the daughter of Lavan his mother's brother, and the sheep of Lavan his mother's brother, Ya'aqov went up and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Lavan his mother's brother.
\v 11 And Ya'aqov kissed Raḥeil, and lifted his voice and wept.
\v 12 Ya'aqov told Raḥeil that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rivqah's son, and she ran and told her father.
\p
\v 13 So when Lavan heard the news of Ya'aqov his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. And he related to Lavan all these things.
\v 14 Lavan said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh." And he stayed with him a new moon.
\p
\v 15 And Lavan said to Ya'aqov, "Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"
\v 16 Now Lavan had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Raḥeil.
\v 17 And Leah's eyes were tender, but Raḥeil was beautiful of form and face.
\v 18 Now Ya'aqov loved Raḥeil, so he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Raḥeil."
\v 19 Lavan said, "It is better that I give her to you than to give her to another man; stay with me."
\v 20 So Ya'aqov served seven years for Raḥeil and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her.
\p
\v 21 And Ya'aqov said to Lavan, "Give me my wife, for my time is completed, that I may go in to her."
\v 22 Lavan gathered all the men of the place and made a banquet.
\v 23 Now in the evening he took his daughter Leah, and brought her to him; and Ya'aqov went in to her.
\v 24 Lavan also gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid.
\v 25 So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Lavan, "What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Raḥeil that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?"
\v 26 But Lavan said, "It is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the firstborn.
\v 27 Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you shall serve with me for another seven years."
\v 28 Ya'aqov did so and completed her week, and he gave him his daughter Raḥeil as his wife.
\v 29 Lavan also gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Raḥeil as her maid.
\v 30 So Ya'aqov went in to Raḥeil also, and indeed he loved Raḥeil more than Leah, and he served with Lavan for another seven years.
\p
\v 31 Now יהוה saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb, but Raḥeil was barren.
\v 32 Leah conceived and brought forth a son and named him Reuven, for she said, "Because יהוה has seen my affliction; surely now my husband will love me."
\v 33 And she conceived again and brought forth a son and said, "Because יהוה has heard that I am hated, He has therefore given me this son also." So she named him Shimon.
\v 34 She conceived again and brought forth a son and said, "Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore he was named Levi.
\v 35 And she conceived again and brought forth a son and said, "This time I will praise יהוה." Therefore she named him Yehudah. And she stopped bringing forth.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 Now when Raḥeil saw that she bore Ya'aqov no children, she became jealous of her sister; and she said to Ya'aqov, "Give me children, or else I die."
\v 2 And Ya'aqov's anger burned against Raḥeil, and he said, "Am I in the place of Elohim, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
\v 3 She said, "Here is my maid Bilhah, go in to her that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children."
\v 4 So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife, and Ya'aqov went in to her.
\v 5 Bilhah conceived and bore Ya'aqov a son.
\v 6 And Raḥeil said, "Elohim has vindicated me, and has indeed heard my voice and has given me a son." Therefore she named him Dan.
\v 7 Raḥeil's maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Ya'aqov a second son.
\v 8 So Raḥeil said, "With wrestlings of powers I have wrestled with my sister, and I have indeed prevailed." And she named him Naphtali.
\p
\v 9 When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Ya'aqov as a wife.
\v 10 Leah's maid Zilpah bore Ya'aqov a son.
\v 11 And Leah said, "How fortunate!" So she named him Gad.
\v 12 Leah's maid Zilpah bore Ya'aqov a second son.
\v 13 And Leah said, "Happy am I! For women will call me happy." So she named him Asher.
\p
\v 14 Now in the days of wheat harvest Reuven went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. And Raḥeil said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
\v 15 But she said to her, "Is it a small matter for you to take my husband? And would you take my son's mandrakes also?" So Raḥeil said, "Therefore he may lie with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes."
\v 16 When Ya'aqov came in from the field in the evening, then Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.
\v 17 Elohim gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Ya'aqov a fifth son.
\v 18 And Leah said, "Elohim has given me my wages because I gave my maid to my husband." So she named him Yissakhar.
\v 19 Leah conceived again and brought forth a sixth son to Ya'aqov.
\v 20 And Leah said, "Elohim has endowed me with a good gift; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zevulun.
\v 21 Afterward she brought forth a daughter and named her Dinah.
\p
\v 22 And Elohim remembered Raḥeil, and Elohim gave heed to her and opened her womb.
\v 23 So she conceived and brought forth a son and said, "Elohim has taken away my reproach."
\v 24 She named him Yoseph, saying, "May יהוה give me another son."
\p
\v 25 Now it came about when Raḥeil had borne Yoseph, that Ya'aqov said to Lavan, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.
\v 26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me depart; for you yourself know my service which I have served you."
\p
\v 27 But Lavan said to him, "If now it pleases you, stay with me; I have divined that יהוה has blessed me on your account."
\v 28 He continued, "Name me your wages, and I will give it."
\v 29 But he said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you and how your cattle have fared with me.
\v 30 For you had little before I came and it has increased to a multitude, and יהוה has blessed you wherever I turned. But now, when shall I provide for my own household also?"
\p
\v 31 So he said, "What shall I give you?" And Ya'aqov said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will again pasture and guard your flock:
\v 32 let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted sheep and every black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages.
\v 33 So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come concerning my wages. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, will be considered stolen."
\p
\v 34 Lavan said, "Good, let it be according to your word."
\v 35 So he removed on that day the striped and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, every one with white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons.
\v 36 And he put a distance of three days' journey between himself and Ya'aqov, and Ya'aqov fed the rest of Lavan's flocks.
\p
\v 37 And Ya'aqov took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods.
\v 38 He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the gutters, even in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink.
\v 39 So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
\v 40 Ya'aqov separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Lavan; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Lavan's flock.
\v 41 Moreover, whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Ya'aqov would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods;
\v 42 but when the flock was feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Lavan's and the stronger Ya'aqov's.
\v 43 So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 Now Ya'aqov heard the words of Lavan's sons, saying, "Ya'aqov has taken away all that was our father's, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this glory."
\v 2 Ya'aqov saw the attitude of Lavan, and behold, it was not friendly toward him as formerly.
\p
\v 3 And יהוה said to Ya'aqov, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you."
\v 4 So Ya'aqov sent and called Raḥeil and Leah to his flock in the field,
\v 5 and said to them, "I see your father's attitude, that it is not friendly toward me as formerly, but the Elohim of my father has been with me.
\v 6 You know that I have served your father with all my strength.
\v 7 Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; however, Elohim did not allow him to hurt me.
\v 8 If he spoke thus, 'The speckled shall be your wages,' then all the flock brought forth speckled; and if he spoke thus, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock brought forth striped.
\v 9 Thus Elohim has taken away your father's livestock and given them to me.
\v 10 And it came about at the time when the flock were mating that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which were mating were striped, speckled, and mottled.
\v 11 And the messenger of Elohim said to me in the dream, 'Ya'aqov,' and I said, 'Here I am.'
\v 12 He said, 'Lift up now your eyes and see that all the male goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen all that Lavan has been doing to you.
\v 13 I am the Elohim of Beth-El, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"
\p
\v 14 Raḥeil and Leah said to him, "Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father's house?
\v 15 Are we not reckoned by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also entirely consumed our purchase price.
\v 16 Surely all the wealth which Elohim has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever Elohim has said to you."
\p
\v 17 And Ya'aqov arose and put his children and his wives upon camels;
\v 18 and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had gathered, his acquired livestock which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Kena'an to his father Yitsḥaq.
\v 19 When Lavan had gone to shear his flock, then Raḥeil stole the teraphim that were her father's.
\v 20 And Ya'aqov deceived Lavan the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing.
\v 21 So he fled with all that he had; and he arose and crossed the Euphrates River, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilad.
\p
\v 22 When it was told Lavan on the third day that Ya'aqov had fled,
\v 23 then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of seven days' journey, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilad.
\v 24 Elohim came to Lavan the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him, "Be careful that you do not speak to Ya'aqov either good or bad."
\p
\v 25 Lavan caught up with Ya'aqov. Now Ya'aqov had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Lavan with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilad.
\v 26 And Lavan said to Ya'aqov, "What have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword?
\v 27 Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with timbrel and with lyre;
\v 28 and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly.
\v 29 It is in my power to do you harm, but the Elohim of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Ya'aqov.'
\v 30 Now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house; but why did you steal my elohim?"
\p
\v 31 And Ya'aqov replied to Lavan, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.
\v 32 The one with whom you find your elohim shall not live; in the presence of our kinsmen point out what is yours among my belongings and take it for yourself." For Ya'aqov did not know that Raḥeil had stolen them.
\p
\v 33 So Lavan went into Ya'aqov's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and entered Raḥeil's tent.
\v 34 Now Raḥeil had taken the teraphim and put them in the camel's saddle, and she sat on them. And Lavan felt through all the tent but did not find them.
\v 35 She said to her father, "Do not let the eyes of my master burn that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me." So he searched but did not find the teraphim.
\p
\v 36 And Ya'aqov became angry and contended with Lavan; and Ya'aqov said to Lavan, "What is my transgression? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me?
\v 37 Though you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.
\p
\v 38 "These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks.
\v 39 That which was torn of beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. You required it of my hand whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
\v 40 Thus I was: by day the heat consumed me and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
\v 41 These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times.
\p
\v 42 "If the Elohim of my father, the Elohim of Avraham, and the fear of Yitsḥaq, had not been for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. Elohim has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, so He rendered judgment last night."
\p
\v 43 And Lavan replied to Ya'aqov, "The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do today to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?
\v 44 So now come, let us cut a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me."
\p
\v 45 And Ya'aqov took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
\v 46 Ya'aqov said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
\v 47 Now Lavan called it Yegar-sahadutha, but Ya'aqov called it Galeed.
\v 48 Lavan said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." Therefore it was named Galeed,
\v 49 and Mitspah, for he said, "May יהוה watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other.
\v 50 If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us, see, Elohim is witness between you and me."
\p
\v 51 Lavan said to Ya'aqov, "Behold this heap and behold the pillar which I have set between you and me.
\v 52 This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm, and you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
\v 53 The Elohim of Avraham and the Elohim of Naḥor, the Elohim of their father, judge between us." So Ya'aqov swore by the fear of his father Yitsḥaq.
\v 54 And Ya'aqov slaughtered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his kinsmen to the meal; and they ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain.
\v 55 Early in the morning Lavan arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them. And Lavan departed and returned to his place.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 Now as Ya'aqov went on his way, the messengers of Elohim met him.
\v 2 Ya'aqov said when he saw them, "This is the camp of Elohim." So he named that place Maḥanaim.
\v 3 And Ya'aqov sent messengers before him to his brother Esaw in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
\ms פרשת וישלח – Parashat Vayishlaḥ
\p
\v 4 He also commanded them saying, "Thus you shall say to my master Esaw: 'Thus says your servant Ya'aqov, "I have sojourned with Lavan, and stayed until now;
\v 5 I have oxen and donkeys and flocks and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my master, that I may find favor in your eyes."'"
\p
\v 6 The messengers returned to Ya'aqov, saying, "We came to your brother Esaw, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."
\v 7 And Ya'aqov was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and the herds and the camels, into two companies;
\v 8 for he said, "If Esaw comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape."
\p
\v 9 Ya'aqov said, "O Elohim of my father Avraham and Elohim of my father Yitsḥaq, O יהוה, who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will prosper you,'
\v 10 I am unworthy of all the loving-kindness and of all the truth which You have shown to Your servant; for with my staff only I crossed this Yarden, and now I have become two companies.
\v 11 Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esaw; for I fear him, that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children.
\v 12 For You said, 'I will surely prosper you and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which is too great to be numbered.'"
\p
\v 13 So he spent the night there. And he selected from what he had with him a present for his brother Esaw:
\v 14 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
\v 15 thirty nursing camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
\v 16 He delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on before me, and put a space between droves."
\v 17 He commanded the one in front, saying, "When my brother Esaw meets you and asks you, saying, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these animals in front of you belong?'
\v 18 then you shall say, 'These belong to your servant Ya'aqov; it is a present sent to my master Esaw. And behold, he also is behind us.'"
\v 19 And he commanded also the second and the third, and all those who followed the droves, saying, "After this manner you shall speak to Esaw when you find him;
\v 20 and you shall say, 'Behold, your servant Ya'aqov also is behind us.'" For he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me. And afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me."
\v 21 So the present passed on before him, while he himself spent that night in the camp.
\p
\v 22 Now he arose that same night and took his two wives and his two maids and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Yabboq.
\v 23 He took them and sent them across the wadi. And he sent across whatever he had.
\p
\v 24 And Ya'aqov was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
\v 25 When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket of his thigh; so the socket of Ya'aqov's thigh was dislocated while he wrestled with him.
\v 26 And he said, "Let me go, for the dawn is breaking." But he said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
\v 27 So he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Ya'aqov."
\v 28 He said, "Your name shall no longer be Ya'aqov, but Yisra'el; for you have striven with Elohim and with men and have prevailed."
\v 29 And Ya'aqov asked him and said, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And he blessed him there.
\v 30 So Ya'aqov named the place Peni'el, for he said, "I have seen Elohim face to face, yet my being has been preserved."
\v 31 Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed over Penu'el, and he was limping on his thigh.
\v 32 Therefore, to this day the children of Yisra'el do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh, because he touched the socket of Ya'aqov's thigh in the sinew of the hip.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 And Ya'aqov lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, Esaw was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Raḥeil and the two maids.
\v 2 He put the maids and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Raḥeil and Yoseph last.
\v 3 But he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
\p
\v 4 And Esaw ran to meet him and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
\v 5 He lifted his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, "Who are these with you?" So he said, "The children whom Elohim has favorably given your servant."
\v 6 And the maids came near with their children, and they bowed down.
\v 7 Leah likewise came near with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Yoseph came near with Raḥeil, and they bowed down.
\v 8 And he said, "What do you mean by all this company which I have met?" And he said, "To find favor in the sight of my master."
\v 9 But Esaw said, "I have plenty, my brother; let what you have be your own."
\v 10 Ya'aqov said, "No, please, if now I have found favor in your eyes, then take my present from my hand, for I see your face as one sees the face of Elohim, and you have received me favorably.
\v 11 Please take my gift which has been brought to you, because Elohim has dealt favorably with me and because I have plenty." Thus he urged him and he took it.
\p
\v 12 And Esaw said, "Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before you."
\v 13 But he said to him, "My master knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds which are nursing are a care to me. And if they are driven hard one day, all the flocks will die.
\v 14 Please let my master pass on before his servant, and I will proceed at my leisure, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my master at Seir."
\p
\v 15 Esaw said, "Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." But he said, "What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my master."
\v 16 So Esaw returned that day on his way to Seir.
\v 17 Ya'aqov journeyed to Sukkoth, and built for himself a house and made sukkahs for his livestock; therefore the place is named Sukkoth.
\p
\v 18 Now Ya'aqov came safely to the city of Shekhem, which is in the land of Kena'an, when he came from Paddan-aram, and camped before the city.
\v 19 He bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the sons of Ḥamor, Shekhem's father, for one hundred pieces of money.
\v 20 And he erected an altar there and called it El-Elohe-Yisra'el.
\c 34
\p
\v 1 Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Ya'aqov, went out to visit the daughters of the land.
\v 2 When Shekhem the son of Ḥamor the Ḥivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force, defiling her.
\v 3 His being cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Ya'aqov, and he loved the girl and spoke to her from his heart.
\v 4 So Shekhem spoke to his father Ḥamor, saying, "Get me this young girl for a wife."
\v 5 Now Ya'aqov heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Ya'aqov kept silent until they came in.
\v 6 And Ḥamor the father of Shekhem went out to Ya'aqov to speak with him.
\v 7 Now the sons of Ya'aqov came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved, and they were very angry because he had done a senseless thing in Yisra'el by lying with Ya'aqov's daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.
\p
\v 8 But Ḥamor spoke with them, saying, "The being of my son Shekhem longs for your daughter; please give her to him in marriage.
\v 9 Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves.
\v 10 Thus you shall live with us, and the land shall be open before you; live and trade in it and acquire property in it."
\v 11 Shekhem also said to her father and to her brothers, "If I find favor in your eyes, then I will give whatever you say to me.
\v 12 Ask me ever so much bridal payment and gift, and I will give according to what you say to me; but give me the girl in marriage."
\p
\v 13 But Ya'aqov's sons answered Shekhem and his father Ḥamor with deceit, because he had defiled Dinah their sister.
\v 14 They said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.
\v 15 Only on this condition will we consent to you: if you will become like us, in that every male of you be circumcised,
\v 16 then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people.
\v 17 But if you will not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go."
\p
\v 18 Now their words seemed reasonable to Ḥamor and Shekhem, Ḥamor's son.
\v 19 The young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with Ya'aqov's daughter. Now he was more respected than all the household of his father.
\v 20 So Ḥamor and his son Shekhem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
\v 21 "These men are friendly with us; therefore let them live in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage, and give our daughters to them.
\v 22 Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.
\v 23 Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will live with us."
\v 24 All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Ḥamor and to his son Shekhem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
\p
\v 25 Now it came about on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of Ya'aqov's sons, Shimon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city dwelling securely, and killed every male.
\v 26 They killed Ḥamor and his son Shekhem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shekhem's house, and went forth.
\v 27 Ya'aqov's sons came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
\v 28 They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and that which was in the city and that which was in the field;
\v 29 and they captured and plundered all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, even all that was in the houses.
\v 30 And Ya'aqov said to Shimon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Kena'anites and the Perizzites; and my men being few in number, they will gather together against me and attack me and I will be destroyed, I and my household."
\v 31 But they said, "Should he treat our sister as a whore?"
\c 35
\p
\v 1 And Elohim said to Ya'aqov, "Arise, go up to Beth-El and live there, and make an altar there to Elohim, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esaw."
\v 2 So Ya'aqov said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign elohim which are among you, and purify yourselves and change your garments;
\v 3 and let us arise and go up to Beth-El, and I will make an altar there to Elohim, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone."
\v 4 So they gave to Ya'aqov all the foreign elohim which they had and the rings which were in their ears, and Ya'aqov hid them under the oak which was near Shekhem.
\p
\v 5 As they journeyed, there was a great terror upon the cities which were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Ya'aqov.
\v 6 So Ya'aqov came to Luz (that is, Beth-El), which is in the land of Kena'an, he and all the people who were with him.
\v 7 He built an altar there, and called the place El-Beth-El, because there Elohim had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother.
\v 8 Now Devorah, Rivqah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Beth-El under the oak; it was named Allon-bakuth.
\p
\v 9 And Elohim appeared to Ya'aqov again when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him.
\p
\v 10 Elohim said to him, "Your name is Ya'aqov; you shall no longer be called Ya'aqov, but Yisra'el shall be your name." Thus He called him Yisra'el.
\p
\v 11 Elohim also said to him, "I am El Shaddai; be fruitful and multiply; a nation and an assembly of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come forth from your loins.
\v 12 The land which I gave to Avraham and Yitsḥaq, I will give it to you, and I will give the land to your seed after you."
\p
\v 13 And Elohim went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him.
\v 14 Ya'aqov set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.
\v 15 So Ya'aqov named the place where Elohim had spoken with him, Beth-El.
\p
\v 16 And they journeyed from Beth-El; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Raḥeil began to give birth and she suffered severe labor.
\v 17 When she was in severe labor the midwife said to her, "Do not fear, for now you have another son."
\v 18 It came about as her being was departing (for she died), that she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benyamin.
\v 19 So Raḥeil died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Beth-leḥem).
\v 20 Ya'aqov set up a pillar over her grave; that is the pillar of Raḥeil's grave to this day.
\v 21 And Yisra'el journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
\p
\v 22 It came about while Yisra'el was dwelling in that land, that Reuven went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine, and Yisra'el heard. Now there were twelve sons of Ya'aqov--
\v 23 the sons of Leah: Reuven, Ya'aqov's firstborn, then Shimon and Levi and Yehudah and Yissakhar and Zevulun;
\v 24 the sons of Raḥeil: Yoseph and Benyamin;
\v 25 and the sons of Bilhah, Raḥeil's maid: Dan and Naphtali;
\v 26 and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Ya'aqov who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
\p
\v 27 Ya'aqov came to his father Yitsḥaq at Mamre of Qiryath-arba (that is, Ḥevron), where Avraham and Yitsḥaq had sojourned.
\p
\v 28 Now the days of Yitsḥaq were one hundred and eighty years.
\v 29 Yitsḥaq breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, an old man of ripe age; and his sons Esaw and Ya'aqov buried him.
\c 36
\p
\v 1 Now these are the generations of Esaw (that is, Edom).
\p
\v 2 Esaw took his wives from the daughters of Kena'an: Adah the daughter of Elon the Ḥittite, and Oholivamah the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Tsivon the Ḥivite;
\v 3 also Basemath, Yishma'el's daughter, the sister of Nevaioth.
\v 4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esaw, and Basemath bore Reu'el,
\v 5 and Oholivamah bore Yeush and Yalam and Qoraḥ. These are the sons of Esaw who were born to him in the land of Kena'an.
\p
\v 6 And Esaw took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all his household, and his livestock and all his cattle and all his goods which he had acquired in the land of Kena'an, and went to another land away from his brother Ya'aqov.
\v 7 For their property had become too great for them to live together, and the land where they sojourned could not sustain them because of their livestock.
\v 8 So Esaw lived in the hill country of Seir; Esaw is Edom.
\p
\v 9 These then are the generations of Esaw the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
\v 10 These are the names of Esaw's sons: Eliphaz the son of Esaw's wife Adah, Reu'el the son of Esaw's wife Basemath.
\v 11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Tsepho and Gatam and Qenaz.
\v 12 Timna was a concubine of Esaw's son Eliphaz and she bore Amaleq to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Esaw's wife Adah.
\v 13 These are the sons of Reu'el: Naḥath and Zeraḥ, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esaw's wife Basemath.
\v 14 These were the sons of Esaw's wife Oholivamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Tsivon: she bore to Esaw, Yeush and Yalam and Qoraḥ.
\p
\v 15 These are the chiefs of the sons of Esaw. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esaw, are chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Tsepho, chief Qenaz,
\v 16 chief Qoraḥ, chief Gatam, chief Amaleq. These are the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.
\v 17 These are the sons of Reu'el, Esaw's son: chief Naḥath, chief Zeraḥ, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs descended from Reu'el in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Esaw's wife Basemath.
\v 18 These are the sons of Esaw's wife Oholivamah: chief Yeush, chief Yalam, chief Qoraḥ. These are the chiefs descended from Esaw's wife Oholivamah, the daughter of Anah.
\v 19 These are the sons of Esaw (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
\p
\v 20 These are the sons of Seir the Ḥorite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shoval and Tsivon and Anah,
\v 21 and Dishon and Etser and Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Ḥorites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.
\v 22 The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
\v 23 These are the sons of Shoval: Alvan and Manaḥath and Eyval, Shepho and Onam.
\v 24 These are the sons of Tsivon: Ayah and Anah-- he is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Tsivon.
\v 25 These are the children of Anah: Dishon, and Oholivamah, the daughter of Anah.
\v 26 These are the sons of Dishon: Ḥemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Ḥeran.
\v 27 These are the sons of Etser: Bilhan and Za'avan and Akan.
\v 28 These are the sons of Dishan: Uts and Aran.
\v 29 These are the chiefs descended from the Ḥorites: chief Lotan, chief Shoval, chief Tsivon, chief Anah,
\v 30 chief Dishon, chief Etser, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Ḥorites, according to their various chiefs in the land of Seir.
\p
\v 31 Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Yisra'el.
\v 32 Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhavah.
\v 33 And Bela died, and Yovav the son of Zeraḥ of Botsrah became king in his place.
\v 34 And Yovav died, and Ḥusham of the land of the Temanites became king in his place.
\v 35 And Ḥusham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moav, became king in his place; and the name of his city was Avith.
\v 36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masreqah became king in his place.
\v 37 And Samlah died, and Sha'ul of Reḥovoth on the River became king in his place.
\v 38 And Sha'ul died, and Ba'al-chanan the son of Akbor became king in his place.
\v 39 And Ba'al-chanan the son of Akbor died, and Hadar became king in his place; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetav'el, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahav.
\p
\v 40 Now these are the names of the chiefs descended from Esaw, according to their families and their localities, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Yetheth,
\v 41 chief Oholivamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
\v 42 chief Qenaz, chief Teman, chief Mivtsar,
\v 43 chief Magdi'el, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom (that is, Esaw, the father of the Edomites), according to their habitations in the land of their possession.

\ms פרשת וישב – Parashat Vayeshev
\p
\v 1 Now Ya'aqov lived in the land where his father had sojourned, in the land of Kena'an.
\v 2 These are the generations of Ya'aqov. Yoseph, when seventeen years of age, was pasturing the flock with his brothers while he was a youth, along with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Yoseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.
\v 3 Now Yisra'el loved Yoseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a varicolored tunic.
\v 4 His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers; and so they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms.
\p
\v 5 And Yoseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
\v 6 He said to them, "Please listen to this dream which I have had;
\v 7 for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf rose up and also stood erect; and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf."
\v 8 And his brothers said to him, "Are you actually going to reign over us? Are you really going to rule over us?" So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
\p
\v 9 Now he had still another dream, and related it to his brothers, and said, "Lo, I have had still another dream; and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
\v 10 He related it to his father and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you have had? Shall I and your mother and your brothers actually come to bow ourselves down before you to the ground?"
\v 11 His brothers were jealous of him, but his father guarded the saying.
\p
\v 12 And his brothers went to pasture their father's flock in Shekhem.
\v 13 Yisra'el said to Yoseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing the flock in Shekhem? Come, and I will send you to them." And he said to him, "I will go."
\v 14 And he said to him, "Go now and see about the welfare of your brothers and the welfare of the flock, and bring word back to me." So he sent him from the valley of Ḥevron, and he came to Shekhem.
\p
\v 15 A man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, "What are you looking for?"
\v 16 He said, "I am looking for my brothers; please tell me where they are pasturing the flock."
\v 17 And the man said, "They have moved from here; for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Yoseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
\p
\v 18 When they saw him from a distance and before he came close to them, they plotted against him to put him to death.
\v 19 They said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer!
\v 20 Now then, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; and we will say, 'A wild beast devoured him.' And let us see what will become of his dreams!"
\v 21 But Reuven heard this and rescued him out of their hands and said, "Let us not strike his being."
\v 22 Reuven further said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hands on him"-- that he might rescue him out of their hands, to restore him to his father.
\v 23 So it came about, when Yoseph reached his brothers, that they stripped Yoseph of his tunic, the varicolored tunic that was on him;
\v 24 and they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty, without any water in it.
\p
\v 25 And they sat down to eat a meal. And as they raised their eyes and looked, behold, a caravan of Yishma'elites was coming from Gilad, with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, on their way to bring them down to Mitsrayim.
\v 26 Yehudah said to his brothers, "What profit is it for us to kill our brother and cover up his blood?
\v 27 Come and let us sell him to the Yishma'elites and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers listened to him.
\v 28 And some Midianite traders passed by, so they pulled him up and lifted Yoseph out of the pit, and sold him to the Yishma'elites for twenty sheqels of silver. Thus they brought Yoseph into Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 29 Now Reuven returned to the pit, and behold, Yoseph was not in the pit; so he tore his garments.
\v 30 He returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is not there; as for me, where am I to go?"
\v 31 So they took Yoseph's tunic, and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in the blood;
\v 32 and they sent the varicolored tunic and brought it to their father and said, "We found this; please examine it to see whether it is your son's tunic or not."
\v 33 And he examined it and said, "It is my son's tunic. A wild beast has devoured him; Yoseph has surely been torn to pieces!"
\v 34 So Ya'aqov tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
\v 35 And all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. And he said, "Surely I will go down to Sheol in mourning for my son." So his father wept for him.
\v 36 Meanwhile, the Midianites sold him in Mitsrayim to Potiphar, Pharaoh's officer, the captain of the bodyguard.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 And it came about at that time, that Yehudah departed from his brothers and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Ḥirah.
\v 2 Yehudah saw there a daughter of a certain Kena'anite whose name was Shua; and he took her and went in to her.
\v 3 So she conceived and brought forth a son and he named him Er.
\v 4 And she conceived again and brought forth a son and named him Onan.
\v 5 She bore still another son and named him Shelah; and it was at Ḥezib that she bore him.
\p
\v 6 Now Yehudah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
\v 7 But Er, Yehudah's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of יהוה, so יהוה killed him.
\v 8 And Yehudah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up seed for your brother."
\v 9 Onan knew that the seed would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife, he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give seed to his brother.
\v 10 But what he did was displeasing in the sight of יהוה; so He killed him also.
\v 11 And Yehudah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up;" for he thought, "I am afraid that he too may die like his brothers." So Tamar went and lived in her father's house.
\p
\v 12 Now after a considerable time Shua's daughter, the wife of Yehudah, died; and when the time of mourning was ended, Yehudah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Ḥirah the Adullamite.
\v 13 It was told to Tamar, "Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
\v 14 So she removed her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gateway of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife.
\v 15 When Yehudah saw her, he thought she was a whore, for she had covered her face.
\v 16 So he turned aside to her by the road, and said, "Here now, let me come in to you;" for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
\v 17 He said, therefore, "I will send you a young goat from the flock." She said, moreover, "Will you give a pledge until you send it?"
\v 18 He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" And she said, "Your seal and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
\v 19 And she arose and departed, and removed her veil and put on her widow's garments.
\p
\v 20 When Yehudah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her.
\v 21 He asked the men of her place, saying, "Where is the temple whore who was by the road at Enaim?" But they said, "There has been no temple whore here."
\v 22 So he returned to Yehudah, and said, "I did not find her; and furthermore, the men of the place said, 'There has been no temple whore here.'"
\v 23 And Yehudah said, "Let her keep them, otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her."
\p
\v 24 Now it was about three new moons later that Yehudah was informed, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has whored, and behold, she is also with child by whoring." And Yehudah said, "Bring her out and let her be burned!"
\v 25 It was while she was being brought out that she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "I am with child by the man to whom these things belong." And she said, "Please examine and see, whose signet ring and cords and staff are these?"
\v 26 Yehudah recognized them, and said, "She is more righteous than I, because as I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not know her again.
\p
\v 27 It came about at the time she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb.
\v 28 Moreover, it took place while she was giving birth, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This one came out first."
\v 29 But it came about as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out. And she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" So he was named Perets.
\v 30 Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand; and he was named Zeraḥ.
\c 39
\p
\v 1 Now Yoseph had been taken down to Mitsrayim; and Potiphar, a Mitsrite officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the Yishma'elites, who had taken him down there.
\v 2 יהוה was with Yoseph, so he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Mitsrite.
\v 3 Now his master saw that יהוה was with him and how יהוה caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.
\v 4 So Yoseph found favor in his eyes and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he owned he put in his charge.
\v 5 It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, יהוה blessed the Mitsrite's house on account of Yoseph; thus the blessing of יהוה was upon all that he owned, in the house and in the field.
\v 6 So he left everything he owned in Yoseph's charge; and with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate. Now Yoseph was handsome in form and appearance.
\p
\v 7 It came about after these events that his master's wife looked with desire at Yoseph, and she said, "Lie with me."
\v 8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Behold, with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house, and he has put all that he owns in my charge.
\v 9 There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against Elohim?"
\v 10 As she spoke to Yoseph day after day, he did not listen to her to lie beside her or be with her.
\v 11 Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the household was there inside.
\v 12 She caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!" And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went outside.
\v 13 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,
\v 14 she called to the men of her household and said to them, "See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I screamed.
\v 15 When he heard that I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside."
\v 16 So she left his garment beside her until his master came home.
\v 17 And she spoke to him with these words, "The Hebrew slave, whom you brought to us, came in to me to make sport of me;
\v 18 and as I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside."
\p
\v 19 Now when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your slave did to me," his anger burned.
\v 20 So Yoseph's master took him and put him into the jail, the place where the king's prisoners were confined; and he was there in the jail.
\v 21 But יהוה was with Yoseph and extended loving-kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.
\v 22 The chief jailer committed to Yoseph's charge all the prisoners who were in the jail; so that whatever was done there, he was responsible for it.
\v 23 The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Yoseph's charge because יהוה was with him; and whatever he did, יהוה made to prosper.
\c 40
\p
\v 1 And it came about after these things, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Mitsrayim offended their master, the king of Mitsrayim.
\v 2 Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
\v 3 So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, in the jail, the same place where Yoseph was imprisoned.
\v 4 The captain of the bodyguard put Yoseph in charge of them, and he took care of them; and they were in confinement for some time.
\v 5 And the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Mitsrayim, who were confined in jail, both had a dream the same night, each man with his own dream and each dream with its own interpretation.
\v 6 When Yoseph came to them in the morning and observed them, behold, they were dejected.
\v 7 He asked Pharaoh's officials who were with him in confinement in his master's house, "Why are your faces so sad today?"
\v 8 And they said to him, "We have had a dream and there is no one to interpret it." And Yoseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to Elohim? Tell it to me, please."
\p
\v 9 So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Yoseph, and said to him, "In my dream, behold, there was a vine in front of me;
\v 10 and on the vine were three branches. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.
\v 11 Now Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I put the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
\v 12 And Yoseph said to him, "This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;
\v 13 within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your ordained position; and you will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand according to your former judgment when you were his cupbearer.
\v 14 Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you, and please do loving-kindness to me by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house.
\v 15 For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the pit."
\p
\v 16 When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Yoseph, "I also saw in my dream, and behold, there were three baskets of white bread on my head;
\v 17 and in the top basket there were some of all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."
\v 18 And Yoseph answered and said, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;
\v 19 within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you."
\p
\v 20 Thus it came about on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a banquet for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
\v 21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaoh's hand;
\v 22 but he hanged the chief baker, just as Yoseph had interpreted to them.
\v 23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Yoseph, but forgot him.

\p
\v 1 Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream, and behold, he was standing by the Nile.
\v 2 And behold, from the Nile there came up seven cows, sleek and fat; and they grazed in the marsh grass.
\v 3 And behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, evil in appearance and thin, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
\v 4 The cows evil in appearance and thin ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
\v 5 He fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good.
\v 6 And behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.
\v 7 The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
\v 8 Now in the morning his spirit was troubled, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Mitsrayim, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
\p
\v 9 And the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I would make mention today of my sins.
\v 10 Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, both me and the chief baker.
\v 11 We had a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his own dream.
\v 12 Now a Hebrew youth was with us there, a servant of the captain of the bodyguard, and we related them to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us. To each one he interpreted according to his own dream.
\v 13 And just as he interpreted for us, so it happened; he restored me in my place, but he hanged him."
\p
\v 14 And Pharaoh sent and called for Yoseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the pit; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh.
\v 15 Pharaoh said to Yoseph, "I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
\v 16 Yoseph then answered Pharaoh, saying, "It is not in me; Elohim will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."
\v 17 So Pharaoh spoke to Yoseph, "In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile;
\v 18 and behold, seven cows, fat and sleek came up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the marsh grass.
\v 19 Behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and evil in form and very thin, such as I had never seen so evil in form in all the land of Mitsrayim;
\v 20 and the thin and evil cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
\v 21 Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be known that they had devoured them, for they were just as evil as before. And I awoke.
\v 22 I saw also in my dream, and behold, seven ears, full and good, came up on a single stalk;
\v 23 and behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them;
\v 24 and the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."
\p
\v 25 Now Yoseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same; Elohim has told to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
\v 26 The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one and the same.
\v 27 The seven thin and evil cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven thin ears scorched by the east wind will be seven years of famine.
\v 28 It is as I have spoken to Pharaoh: Elohim has shown to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
\v 29 Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 30 And after them seven years of famine will come, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Mitsrayim, and the famine will ravage the land.
\v 31 So the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that subsequent famine; for it will be very heavy.
\v 32 Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it means that the matter is determined by Elohim, and Elohim will quickly bring it about.
\v 33 Now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 34 Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers in charge of the land, and let him exact a fifth of the produce of the land of Mitsrayim in the seven years of abundance.
\v 35 And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and store up the grain for food in the cities under Pharaoh's authority, and let them guard it.
\v 36 Let the food become as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Mitsrayim, so that the land will not be cut off during the famine."
\p
\v 37 Now the proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.
\p
\v 38 And Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Ruaḥ of Elohim?"
\v 39 So Pharaoh said to Yoseph, "Since Elohim has informed you of all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you are.
\v 40 You shall be over my house, and according to your command all my people shall do homage; only in the throne I will be greater than you."
\v 41 Pharaoh said to Yoseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Mitsrayim."
\v 42 And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Yoseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck.
\v 43 He had him ride in his second chariot; and they proclaimed before him, "Bow the knee!" And he set him over all the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 44 Moreover, Pharaoh said to Yoseph, "I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Mitsrayim."
\v 45 And Pharaoh named Yoseph 'Tsaphenath-paneaḥ'; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, as his wife. And Yoseph went forth over the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 46 Now Yoseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Mitsrayim. And Yoseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 47 During the seven years of plenty the land brought forth abundantly.
\v 48 So he gathered all the food of these seven years which occurred in the land of Mitsrayim and placed the food in the cities; he placed in every city the food from its own surrounding fields.
\v 49 Thus Yoseph stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.
\p
\v 50 Now before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Yoseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.
\v 51 Yoseph named the firstborn Menasheh, "For Elohim has made me forget all my toil and all my father's household."
\v 52 He named the second Ephrayim, "For Elohim has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
\p
\v 53 When the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Mitsrayim came to an end,
\v 54 and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Yoseph had said, then there was famine in all the lands, but in all the land of Mitsrayim there was bread.
\v 55 So when all the land of Mitsrayim was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Mitsrites, "Go to Yoseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do."
\v 56 When the famine was spread over all the face of the earth, then Yoseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Mitsrites; and the famine was severe in the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 57 All the earth came to Mitsrayim to buy grain from Yoseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
\c 42
\p
\v 1 Now Ya'aqov saw that there was grain in Mitsrayim, and Ya'aqov said to his sons, "Why are you staring at one another?"
\v 2 He said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Mitsrayim; go down there and buy some for us from that place, so that we may live and not die."
\v 3 And ten brothers of Yoseph went down to buy grain from Mitsrayim.
\v 4 But Ya'aqov did not send Yoseph's brother Benyamin with his brothers, for he said, "I am afraid that harm may befall him."
\v 5 So the sons of Yisra'el came to buy grain among those who were coming, for the famine was in the land of Kena'an also.
\p
\v 6 Now Yoseph was the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Yoseph's brothers came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
\v 7 When Yoseph saw his brothers he recognized them, but he disguised himself to them and spoke to them harshly. And he said to them, "Where have you come from?" And they said, "From the land of Kena'an, to buy food."
\p
\v 8 But Yoseph had recognized his brothers, although they did not recognize him.
\v 9 Yoseph remembered the dreams which he had about them, and said to them, "You are spies; you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land."
\v 10 And they said to him, "No, my master, but your servants have come to buy food.
\v 11 We are all sons of one man; we are honest men: your servants are not spies."
\v 12 Yet he said to them, "No, but you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land!"
\v 13 But they said, "Your servants are twelve brothers in all, the sons of one man in the land of Kena'an; and behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer alive."
\v 14 Yoseph said to them, "It is as I said to you, you are spies;
\v 15 by this you will be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here!
\v 16 Send one of you that he may get your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. But if not, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies."
\v 17 So he put them all together in prison for three days.
\p
\v 18 Now Yoseph said to them on the third day, "Do this and live, for I fear Elohim:
\v 19 if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your prison; but as for the rest of you, go, carry grain for the famine of your households,
\v 20 and bring your youngest brother to me, so your words may be believed, and you will not die." And they did so.
\v 21 And they said to one another, "Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his being when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us."
\v 22 Reuven answered them, saying, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy;' and you would not listen? Now comes the reckoning for his blood."
\v 23 They did not know, however, that Yoseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.
\v 24 He turned away from them and wept. But when he returned to them and spoke to them, he took Shimon from them and bound him before their eyes.
\v 25 And Yoseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. And thus it was done for them.
\p
\v 26 So they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there.
\v 27 As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
\v 28 And he said to his brothers, "My money has been returned, and behold, it is even in my sack." And their hearts sank, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, "What is this that Elohim has done to us?"
\p
\v 29 When they came to their father Ya'aqov in the land of Kena'an, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,
\v 30 "The man, the master of the land, spoke harshly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
\v 31 But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies.
\v 32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Kena'an.'
\v 33 The man, the master of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your households, and go.
\v 34 But bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies, but honest men. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.'"
\p
\v 35 Now it came about as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were dismayed.
\v 36 Their father Ya'aqov said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children: Yoseph is no more, and Shimon is no more, and you would take Benyamin; all these things are against me."
\v 37 And Reuven spoke to his father, saying, "You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my care, and I will return him to you."
\v 38 But Ya'aqov said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should befall him on the journey you are taking, then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow."
\c 43
\p
\v 1 Now the famine was heavy in the land.
\v 2 So it came about when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Mitsrayim, that their father said to them, "Go back, buy us a little food."
\v 3 Yehudah spoke to him, however, saying, "The man solemnly warned us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'
\v 4 If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.
\v 5 But if you do not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
\p
\v 6 And Yisra'el said, "Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man that you had another brother?"
\v 7 But they said, "The man questioned particularly about us and our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' So we answered his questions. Could we possibly know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"
\v 8 Yehudah said to his father Yisra'el, "Send the lad with me and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, we as well as you and our little ones.
\v 9 I myself will be surety for him; you may hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame before you forever.
\v 10 For if we had not delayed, surely by now we could have returned twice."
\p
\v 11 And their father Yisra'el said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man as a present, a little balm and a little honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, nuts and almonds.
\v 12 Take double the money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.
\v 13 Take your brother also, and arise, return to the man;
\v 14 and may El Shaddai grant you compassion in the sight of the man, so that he will release your other brother to you and Benyamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
\v 15 So the men took this present, and they took double the money in their hand, and Benyamin; then they arose and went down to Mitsrayim and stood before Yoseph.
\p
\v 16 When Yoseph saw Benyamin with them, he said to his house steward, "Bring the men into the house, and slay an animal and make ready; for the men are to dine with me at noon."
\p
\v 17 So the man did as Yoseph said, and brought the men to Yoseph's house.
\v 18 Now the men were afraid, because they were brought to Yoseph's house; and they said, "It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time that we are being brought in, that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, and take us for slaves with our donkeys."
\p
\v 19 So they came near to Yoseph's house steward, and spoke to him at the entrance of the house,
\v 20 and said, "Oh, my master, we indeed came down the first time to buy food,
\v 21 and it came about when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full. So we have brought it back in our hand.
\v 22 We have also brought down other money in our hand to buy food; we do not know who put our money in our sacks."
\p
\v 23 He said, "Be at peace, do not be afraid. Your Elohim and the Elohim of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money." And he brought Shimon out to them.
\v 24 And the man brought the men into Yoseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder.
\v 25 So they prepared the present for Yoseph's coming at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.
\v 26 When Yoseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which was in their hand and bowed to the ground before him.
\v 27 And he asked them about their welfare, and said, "Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"
\v 28 They said, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." They stooped low and bowed down.
\v 29 As he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benyamin, his mother's son, he said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?" And he said, "May Elohim show favor to you, my son."
\p
\v 30 Yoseph hurried out for he was deeply stirred over his brother, and he sought a place to weep; and he entered his chamber and wept there.
\v 31 And he washed his face and came out; and he controlled himself and said, "Serve the meal."
\v 32 So they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Mitsrites who ate with him by themselves, because the Mitsrites could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Mitsrites.
\v 33 Now they were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.
\v 34 He took portions to them from his own table, but Benyamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
\c 44
\p
\v 1 And he commanded his house steward, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack.
\v 2 Put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his money for the grain." And he did as Yoseph had told him.
\p
\v 3 As soon as it was light, the men were sent away, they with their donkeys.
\v 4 They had just gone out of the city, and were not far off, when Yoseph said to his house steward, "Up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?
\v 5 Is not this the one from which my master drinks and which he does surely divine? You have done wrong in doing this.'"
\p
\v 6 So he overtook them and spoke these words to them.
\v 7 They said to him, "Why does my master speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing.
\v 8 Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Kena'an. How then could we steal silver or gold from your master's house?
\v 9 With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my master's slaves."
\p
\v 10 So he said, "Now let it also be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and the rest of you shall be innocent."
\p
\v 11 And they hurried, each man lowering his sack to the ground, and each man opening his sack.
\v 12 He searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benyamin's sack.
\v 13 And they tore their clothes, and when each man loaded his donkey, they returned to the city.
\p
\v 14 When Yehudah and his brothers came to Yoseph's house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him.
\v 15 Yoseph said to them, "What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed practice divination?"
\p
\v 16 So Yehudah said, "What can we say to my master? What can we speak? And how can we declare ourselves right? Elohim has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my master's slaves, both we and the one in whose possession the cup has been found."
\p
\v 17 But he said, "Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose possession the cup has been found, he shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."
\ms פרשת ויגש – Parashat Vayigash
\p
\v 18 And Yehudah drew near him, and said, "Oh my master, may your servant please speak a word in my master's ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal to Pharaoh.
\v 19 My master asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father or a brother?'
\v 20 We said to my master, 'We have an old father and a little child of his old age. Now his brother is dead, so he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.'
\v 21 And you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes on him.'
\v 22 But we said to my master, 'The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'
\v 23 You said to your servants, however, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'
\v 24 Thus it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my master.
\v 25 Our father said, 'Go back, buy us a little food.'
\v 26 But we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
\v 27 Your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons;
\v 28 and the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces," and I have not seen him since.
\v 29 If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.'
\v 30 Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his being is bound up in the lad's being,
\v 31 when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will die. Thus your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow.
\v 32 For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then let me bear the blame before my father forever.'
\v 33 Now, therefore, please let your servant remain – instead of the lad – as a slave to my master, and let the lad go up with his brothers.
\v 34 For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me; for fear that I see the evil that would overtake my father?"
\c 45
\p
\v 1 And Yoseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried, "Have everyone go out from me." So there was no man with him when Yoseph made himself known to his brothers.
\v 2 He wept so loudly that the Mitsrites heard, and the household of Pharaoh heard.
\v 3 And Yoseph said to his brothers, "I am Yoseph! Is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
\p
\v 4 And Yoseph said to his brothers, "Please come closer to me." And they came closer. And he said, "I am your brother Yoseph, whom you sold into Mitsrayim.
\v 5 Now do not be grieved, nor let your eyes burn at yourselves, because you sold me here, for Elohim sent me before you to preserve life.
\v 6 For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.
\v 7 Elohim sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.
\p
\v 8 "Now, therefore, it was not you who sent me here, but Elohim; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and master of all his household and ruler over all the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 9 Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, 'Thus says your son Yoseph, "Elohim has made me master of all Mitsrayim; come down to me, do not delay.
\v 10 You shall live in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children and your flocks and your herds and all that you have.
\v 11 There I will also provide for you, for there are still five years of famine to come, and you and your household and all that you have would be impoverished."'
\p
\v 12 "Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benyamin see, that it is my mouth which is speaking to you.
\v 13 Now you must tell my father of all my glory in Mitsrayim, and all that you have seen; and you must hurry and bring my father down here."
\p
\v 14 And he fell on his brother Benyamin's neck and wept, and Benyamin wept on his neck.
\v 15 He kissed all his brothers and wept on them, and afterward his brothers talked with him.
\p
\v 16 Now when the news was heard in Pharaoh's house that Yoseph's brothers had come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.
\v 17 And Pharaoh said to Yoseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go to the land of Kena'an,
\v 18 and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Mitsrayim and you will eat the fat of the land.'
\v 19 Now you are ordered, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Mitsrayim for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come.
\v 20 Do not concern yourselves with your goods, for the best of all the land of Mitsrayim is yours.'"
\p
\v 21 And the sons of Yisra'el did so; and Yoseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
\v 22 To each of them he gave changes of garments, but to Benyamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.
\v 23 To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Mitsrayim, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and sustenance for his father on the journey.
\p
\v 24 So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, "Do not quarrel on the journey."
\v 25 And they went up from Mitsrayim, and came to the land of Kena'an to their father Ya'aqov.
\v 26 They told him, saying, "Yoseph is still alive, and indeed he is ruler over all the land of Mitsrayim." But he was stunned, for he did not believe them.
\v 27 When they told him all the words of Yoseph that he had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons that Yoseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Ya'aqov revived.
\v 28 And Yisra'el said, "It is enough; my son Yoseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
\c 46
\p
\v 1 So Yisra'el set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheva, and slaughtered sacrifices to the Elohim of his father Yitsḥaq.
\v 2 Elohim spoke to Yisra'el in visions of the night and said, "Ya'aqov, Ya'aqov." And he said, "Here I am."
\v 3 He said, "I am El, the Elohim of your father; do not fear to descend to Mitsrayim, for I will make you a great nation there.
\v 4 I will go down with you to Mitsrayim, and I will also surely bring you up again; and Yoseph shall put his hand on your eyes."
\p
\v 5 And Ya'aqov arose from Beersheva; and the sons of Yisra'el carried their father Ya'aqov and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
\v 6 They took their livestock and their property, which they had acquired in the land of Kena'an, and came to Mitsrayim, Ya'aqov and all his seed with him:
\v 7 his sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his seed he brought with him to Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 8 Now these are the names of the sons of Yisra'el, Ya'aqov and his sons, who went to Mitsrayim: Reuven, Ya'aqov's firstborn.
\v 9 The sons of Reuven: Ḥanokh and Pallu and Ḥetsron and Karmi.
\v 10 The sons of Shimon: Yemu'el and Yamin and Ohad and Yakin and Tsoḥar and Sha'ul the son of a Kena'anite woman.
\v 11 The sons of Levi: Gershon, Qohath, and Merari.
\v 12 The sons of Yehudah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perets and Zeraḥ (but Er and Onan died in the land of Kena'an). And the sons of Perets were Ḥetsron and Ḥamul.
\v 13 The sons of Yissakhar: Tola and Puvvah and Yov and Shimron.
\v 14 The sons of Zevulun: Sered and Elon and Yaḥle'el.
\v 15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Ya'aqov in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all the beings of his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three.
\v 16 The sons of Gad: Tsiphion and Ḥaggi, Shuni and Etsbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli.
\v 17 The sons of Asher: Yimnah and Yishvah and Ishvi and Beriah and their sister Seraḥ. And the sons of Beriah: Ḥeber and Malki'el.
\v 18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Lavan gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore to Ya'aqov these sixteen beings.
\v 19 The sons of Ya'aqov's wife Raḥeil: Yoseph and Benyamin.
\v 20 Now to Yoseph in the land of Mitsrayim were born Menasheh and Ephrayim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.
\v 21 The sons of Benyamin: Bela and Beḥer and Ashbel, Gera and Na'aman, Eḥi and Rosh, Muppim and Ḥuppim and Ard.
\v 22 These are the sons of Raḥeil, who were born to Ya'aqov; there were fourteen persons in all.
\v 23 The sons of Dan: Ḥushim.
\v 24 The sons of Naphtali: Yaḥtse'el and Guni and Yetser and Shillem.
\v 25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Lavan gave to his daughter Raḥeil, and she bore these to Ya'aqov; there were seven persons in all.
\v 26 All the persons belonging to Ya'aqov, who came to Mitsrayim, his direct descendants, not including the wives of Ya'aqov's sons, were sixty-six persons in all,
\v 27 and the sons of Yoseph, who were born to him in Mitsrayim were two; all the persons of the house of Ya'aqov, who came to Mitsrayim, were seventy.
\p
\v 28 Now he sent Yehudah before him to Yoseph, to point out the way before him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
\v 29 Yoseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Yisra'el; as soon as he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time.
\p
\v 30 And Yisra'el said to Yoseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive."
\v 31 Yoseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Kena'an, have come to me;
\v 32 and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.'
\v 33 When Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?'
\v 34 you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,' that you may live in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Mitsrites."
\c 47
\p
\v 1 And Yoseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, "My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they have, have come out of the land of Kena'an; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
\p
\v 2 He took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.
\v 3 And Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" So they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers."
\v 4 They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is heavy in the land of Kena'an. Now, therefore, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen."
\p
\v 5 And Pharaoh said to Yoseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.
\v 6 The land of Mitsrayim is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land, let them live in the land of Goshen; and if you know any men of valor among them, then put them in charge of my livestock."
\p
\v 7 And Yoseph brought his father Ya'aqov and presented him to Pharaoh; and Ya'aqov blessed Pharaoh.
\v 8 Pharaoh said to Ya'aqov, "How many years have you lived?"
\v 9 So Ya'aqov said to Pharaoh, "The years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty; few and evil have been the days of years of my life, and they have not attained the years that my fathers lived during the days of their sojourning."
\v 10 And Ya'aqov blessed Pharaoh, and went out from his presence.
\v 11 So Yoseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Mitsrayim, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had ordered.
\v 12 Yoseph provided his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food, according to their little ones.
\p
\v 13 Now there was no food in all the land, because the famine was very severe, so that the land of Mitsrayim and the land of Kena'an languished because of the famine.
\v 14 Yoseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Mitsrayim and in the land of Kena'an for the grain which they bought, and Yoseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
\p
\v 15 When the money was all spent in the land of Mitsrayim and in the land of Kena'an, all the Mitsrites came to Yoseph and said, "Give us food, for why should we die in your presence? For our money is gone."
\v 16 And Yoseph said, "Give up your livestock, and I will give you food for your livestock, since your money is gone."
\v 17 So they brought their livestock to Yoseph, and Yoseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
\v 18 When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, "We will not hide from my master that our money is all spent, and the cattle are my master's. There is nothing left for my master except our bodies and our lands.
\v 19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. So give us seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate."
\p
\v 20 So Yoseph bought all the land of Mitsrayim for Pharaoh, for every Mitsrite sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. Thus the land became Pharaoh's.
\v 21 As for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of Mitsrayim's border to the other.
\v 22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore, they did not sell their land.
\v 23 And Yoseph said to the people, "Behold, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh; now, here is seed for you, that you may sow the land.
\v 24 At the harvest you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for those of your households and as food for your little ones."
\v 25 So they said, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my master, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves."
\v 26 Yoseph made it a statute concerning the land of Mitsrayim to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh's.
\p
\v 27 Now Yisra'el lived in the land of Mitsrayim, in Goshen, and they acquired property in it and were fruitful and became very numerous.
\ms פרשת ויחי – Parashat Vayeḥi
\p
\v 28 Ya'aqov lived in the land of Mitsrayim seventeen years; so the length of Ya'aqov's life was one hundred and forty-seven years.
\p
\v 29 When the time for Yisra'el to die drew near, he called his son Yoseph and said to him, "Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, place now your hand under my thigh and deal with me in loving-kindness and truth. Please do not bury me in Mitsrayim,
\v 30 but when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Mitsrayim and bury me in their grave." And he said, "I will do as you have said."
\v 31 He said, "Swear to me." So he swore to him. And Yisra'el bowed at the head of the bed.
\c 48
\p
\v 1 Now it came about after these things that Yoseph was told, "Behold, your father is sick." So he took his two sons Menasheh and Ephrayim with him.
\v 2 When it was told to Ya'aqov, "Behold, your son Yoseph has come to you," Yisra'el collected his strength and sat up in the bed.
\v 3 And Ya'aqov said to Yoseph, "El Shaddai appeared to me at Luz in the land of Kena'an and blessed me,
\v 4 and He said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and numerous, and I will make you an assembly of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.'
\v 5 Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Mitsrayim before I came to you in Mitsrayim, are mine; Ephrayim and Menasheh shall be mine, as Reuven and Shimon are.
\v 6 But your offspring that have been born after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the names of their brothers in their inheritance.
\v 7 Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, Raḥeil died, to my sorrow, in the land of Kena'an on the journey, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Beth-leḥem)."
\p
\v 8 When Yisra'el saw Yoseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?"
\v 9 Yoseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom Elohim has given me here." So he said, "Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them."
\v 10 Now the eyes of Yisra'el were so dim from age that he could not see. And Yoseph brought them close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
\v 11 Yisra'el said to Yoseph, "I never expected to see your face, and behold, Elohim has let me see your seed as well."
\v 12 And Yoseph took them from his knees, and bowed with his face to the ground.
\v 13 Yoseph took them both, Ephrayim with his right hand toward Yisra'el's left, and Menasheh with his left hand toward Yisra'el's right, and brought them close to him.
\v 14 But Yisra'el stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephrayim, who was the younger, and his left hand on Menasheh's head, crossing his hands, although Menasheh was the firstborn.
\p
\v 15 He blessed Yoseph, and said, "The Elohim before whom my fathers Avraham and Yitsḥaq walked, the Elohim who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
\v 16 the messenger who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads; and may my name live on in them, and the names of my fathers Avraham and Yitsḥaq; and may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
\p
\v 17 When Yoseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephrayim's head, it displeased him; and he grasped his father's hand to remove it from Ephrayim's head to Menasheh's head.
\v 18 Yoseph said to his father, "Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn. Place your right hand on his head."
\v 19 But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know; he also will become a people and he also will be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become the fullness of the nations."
\p
\v 20 He blessed them that day, saying, "By you Yisra'el will pronounce blessing, saying, 'May Elohim make you like Ephrayim and Menasheh!'" Thus he put Ephrayim before Menasheh.
\p
\v 21 And Yisra'el said to Yoseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but Elohim will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers.
\v 22 I give you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow."
\c 49
\p
\v 1 And Ya'aqov summoned his sons and said, "Assemble yourselves that I may tell you what will happen to you in the latter days.
\v 2 "Gather together and hear, O sons of Ya'aqov; and listen to Yisra'el your father.
\v 3 "Reuven, you are my firstborn; my might and the beginning of my strength, preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.
\v 4 As unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it: he went up to my couch.
\p
\v 5 "Shimon and Levi are brothers; their swords are implements of violence.
\v 6 Let my being not enter into their council; let not my glory be united with their assembly; because in their anger they slew men, and in their self-will they lamed oxen.
\v 7 Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel. I will disperse them in Ya'aqov, and scatter them in Yisra'el.
\p
\v 8 "Yehudah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons shall bow down to you.
\v 9 Yehudah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He crouches, he lies down as a lion, and as a stout lion, who dares rouse him up?
\v 10 The scepter shall not depart from Yehudah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
\v 11 He ties his foal to the vine, and his donkey's colt to the choice vine; He washes his garments in wine, and his robes in the blood of grapes.
\v 12 His eyes are dark from wine, and his teeth white from milk.
\p
\v 13 "Zevulun will dwell at the seashore; and he shall be a haven for ships, and his flank shall be toward Tsidon.
\p
\v 14 "Yissakhar is a strong donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds.
\v 15 When he saw that a resting place was good and that the land was pleasant, he bowed his shoulder to bear burdens, and became a slave at forced labor.
\p
\v 16 "Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Yisra'el.
\v 17 Dan shall be a naḥash in the way, a horned snake in the path that bites the horse's heels, so that his rider falls backward.
\v 18 For Your salvation I wait, O יהוה.
\v 19 "As for Gad, raiders shall raid him, but he will raid at their heels.
\v 20 "As for Asher, his food shall be rich, and he will yield royal dainties.
\v 21 "Naphtali is a doe let loose, he gives beautiful speeches.
\p
\v 22 "Yoseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; its branches run over a wall.
\v 23 The archers bitterly attacked him, and shot at him and harassed him;
\v 24 But his bow remained firm, and his arms were agile, From the hands of the Mighty One of Ya'aqov (From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Yisra'el),
\v 25 From the El of your father who helps you, and by the Almighty who blesses you with blessings of heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
\v 26 The blessings of your father have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; may they be on the head of Yoseph, and on the crown of the head of the one separated from his brothers.
\p
\v 27 "Benyamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the spoil."
\p
\v 28 All these are the twelve tribes of Yisra'el, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He blessed them, every one with the blessing appropriate to him.
\p
\v 29 And he charged them and said to them, "I am about to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Ḥittite,
\v 30 in the cave that is in the field of Makhpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Kena'an, which Avraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Ḥittite for a burial site.
\v 31 There they buried Avraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Yitsḥaq and his wife Rivqah, and there I buried Leah;
\v 32 the field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Ḥeth."
\p
\v 33 When Ya'aqov finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
\c 50
\p
\v 1 And Yoseph fell on his father's face, and wept over him and kissed him.
\v 2 Yoseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Yisra'el.
\v 3 Now forty days were required for it, for such is the period required for embalming. And the Mitsrites wept for him seventy days.
\v 4 When the days of mourning for him were past, Yoseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak to Pharaoh, saying,
\v 5 'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I am about to die; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Kena'an, there you shall bury me." Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.'"
\p
\v 6 Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear."
\p
\v 7 So Yoseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Mitsrayim,
\v 8 and all the household of Yoseph and his brothers and his father's household; they left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen.
\v 9 There also went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very heavy company.
\v 10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Yarden, they lamented there with a very great and heavy lamentation; and he observed seven days mourning for his father.
\v 11 Now when the inhabitants of the land, the Kena'anites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a heavy mourning for the Mitsrites." Therefore it was named Havel-Mitsrayim, which is beyond the Yarden.
\v 12 Thus his sons did for him as he had charged them;
\v 13 for his sons carried him to the land of Kena'an and buried him in the cave of the field of Makhpelah before Mamre, which Avraham had bought along with the field for a burial site from Ephron the Ḥittite.
\v 14 After he had buried his father, Yoseph returned to Mitsrayim, he and his brothers, and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
\p
\v 15 When Yoseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Yoseph bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him!"
\v 16 So they sent a message to Yoseph, saying, "Your father charged before he died, saying,
\v 17 'Thus you shall say to Yoseph, "Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong."' And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the Elohim of your father." And Yoseph wept when they spoke to him.
\v 18 And his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, "Behold, we are your servants."
\p
\v 19 But Yoseph said to them, "Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of Elohim?
\v 20 As for you, you meant evil against me, but Elohim meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive.
\v 21 So therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones." So he comforted them and spoke to them from his heart.
\p
\v 22 Now Yoseph stayed in Mitsrayim, he and his father's household, and Yoseph lived one hundred and ten years.
\v 23 Yoseph saw the third generation of Ephrayim's sons; also the sons of Makir, the son of Menasheh, were brought up on Yoseph's knees.
\v 24 Yoseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but Elohim will surely take care of you and bring you up from this land to the land which He promised on oath to Avraham, to Yitsḥaq and to Ya'aqov."
\v 25 And Yoseph made the sons of Yisra'el swear, saying, "Elohim will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones up from here."
\p
\v 26 So Yoseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Mitsrayim.
