\v 1 The words of Yirmeyahu the son of Ḥilqiyahu, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benyamin:
\v 2 to whom the word of יהוה. came in the days of Yoshiyahu the son of Amon, king of Yehudah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
\v 3 It came also in the days of Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah, to the end of the eleventh year of Tsidqiyahu, the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah, to the carrying away of Yerushalayim captive in the fifth new moon.
\p
\v 4 Now the word of יהוה came to me, saying,
\v 5 "Before I formed you in the belly, I knew you. Before you came forth out of the womb, I set you apart. I have appointed you a prophet to the nations."
\v 6 Then I said, "Ah, Adonai יהוה! Behold, I do not know how to speak; for I am a child."
\p
\v 7 But יהוה said to me, "Do not say, 'I am a child;' for to whomever I shall send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you, you shall speak.
\v 8 Do not be afraid because of them; for I am with you to deliver you," says יהוה.
\p
\v 9 Then יהוה put forth His hand, and touched my mouth; and יהוה said to me, "Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.
\v 10 Behold, I have set you over the nations and over the kingdoms today, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."
\p
\v 11 Moreover the word of יהוה came to me, saying, "Yirmeyahu, what do you see?" I said, "I see a branch of an almond tree."
\v 12 Then יהוה said to me, "You have seen well; for I watch over My word to perform it."
\p
\v 13 The word of יהוה came to me the second time, saying, "What do you see?" I said, "I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north."
\v 14 Then יהוה said to me, "Out of the north evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land.
\v 15 For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north," says יהוה; "and they shall come, and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Yerushalayim, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Yehudah.
\v 16 I will utter My judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken Me, and have burned incense to other elohim, and bowed down to the works of their own hands.
\p
\v 17 "You therefore, gird up your loins, arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them.
\v 18 For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and copper walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Yehudah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.
\v 19 They will fight against you; but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you," says יהוה, "to deliver you."
\c 2
\p
\v 1 The word of יהוה came to me, saying,
\v 2 "Go, and cry in the ears of Yerushalayim, saying, 'Thus says יהוה, "I remember for you the loving-kindness of your youth, the love of your weddings; how you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
\v 3 Yisra'el was set-apart to יהוה, the first fruits of His increase. All who devour him shall be held guilty. Evil shall come on them,"' says יהוה.
\v 4 Hear the word of יהוה, O house of Ya'aqov, and all the families of the house of Yisra'el!
\p
\v 5 Thus says יהוה, "What unrighteousness have your fathers found in Me, that they have gone far from Me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
\v 6 Neither did they say, 'Where is יהוה who brought us up out of the land of Mitsrayim, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man lived?'
\v 7 I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled My land, and made My heritage an abomination.
\v 8 The priests did not say, 'Where is יהוה?' and those who handle the Torah did not know Me. The rulers also transgressed against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Ba'al, and walked after things that do not profit.
\p
\v 9 "Therefore I will yet contend with you," says יהוה, "and I will contend with your children's children.
\v 10 For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see; and send to Qedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been such a thing.
\v 11 Has a nation changed its elohim, which really are no elohim? But My people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
\p
\v 12 "Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid. Be very desolate," says יהוה.
\v 13 "For My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Me, the spring of living waters, and cut them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
\v 14 Is Yisra'el a servant? Is he a native-born slave? Why has he become plunder?
\v 15 The young lions have roared at him, and yelled. They have made his land waste. His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.
\v 16 The children also of Noph and Taḥpanḥes have broken the crown of your head.
\p
\v 17 "Have you not procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken יהוה your Elohim, when He led you by the way?
\v 18 Now what have you to do in the way to Mitsrayim, to drink the waters of the Shiḥor? Or what have you to do in the way to Ashuwr, to drink the waters of the River?
\p
\v 19 "Your own wickedness shall discipline you, and your backsliding shall reprove you. Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter thing, that you have forsaken יהוה your Elohim, and that My fear is not in you," says Adonai יהוה Tsevaot.
\p
\v 20 "For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, 'I will not serve;' for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself, whoring.
\v 21 Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to Me?
\v 22 For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before Me," says Adonai יהוה.
\p
\v 23 "How can you say, 'I am not defiled. I have not gone after the Ba'als'? See your way in the valley. Know what you have done. You are a swift camel traversing her ways;
\v 24 a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire. When she is in heat, who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her new moon, they will find her.
\p
\v 25 "Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'It is in vain. No, for I have loved strangers, and I will go after them.'
\v 26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Yisra'el ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;
\v 27 who tell wood, 'You are my father;' and a stone, 'You have brought me out:' for they have turned their back to Me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, 'Arise, and save us.'
\p
\v 28 "But where are your elohim that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your elohim, Yehudah.
\p
\v 29 "Why will you contend with Me? You all have transgressed against Me," says יהוה.
\v 30 "I have struck your children in vain. They received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
\v 31 Generation, consider the word of יהוה. Have I been a wilderness to Yisra'el? Or a land of thick darkness? Why do My people say, 'We have broken loose. We will come to You no more'?
\p
\v 32 "Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me for days without number.
\v 33 How well you prepare your way to seek love! Therefore you have taught even the wicked women your ways.
\v 34 Also the blood of the beings of the innocent poor is found in your skirts. You did not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.
\p
\v 35 "Yet you said, 'I am innocent. Surely His anger has turned away from me.' "Behold, I will judge you, because you say, 'I have not sinned.'
\v 36 Why do you go about so much to change your way? You will be ashamed of Mitsrayim also, as you were ashamed of Ashuwr.
\v 37 From there also you shall go forth, with your hands on your head; for יהוה has rejected those in whom you trust, and you shall not prosper with them.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 "It is said, 'If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and become another man's, will he return to her again?' Would not that land be greatly polluted? But you have whored with many lovers; yet return again to Me," says יהוה.
\p
\v 2 "Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat for them by the ways, as an Aravian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your whoring and with your wickedness.
\v 3 Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.
\p
\v 4 Will you not from this time cry to me, 'My Father, you are the guide of my youth'?
\v 5 "'Will He retain His anger forever? Will He guard it to the end?' Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way."
\p
\v 6 Moreover, יהוה said to me in the days of Yoshiyahu the king, "Have you seen that which backsliding Yisra'el has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has whored.
\v 7 I said after she had done all these things, 'She will return to Me;' but she did not return; and her deceitful sister Yehudah saw it.
\v 8 I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Yisra'el had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet deceitful Yehudah, her sister, did not fear; but she also went and whored.
\v 9 It happened through the lightness of her whoring, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with the stone and with the tree.
\v 10 Yet for all this her deceitful sister, Yehudah, has not returned to Me with her whole heart, but only in pretense," says יהוה.
\p
\v 11 יהוה said to me, "Backsliding Yisra'el has shown herself more righteous than deceitful Yehudah.
\v 12 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, 'Return, you backsliding Yisra'el,' says יהוה; 'I will not look in anger on you; for I am kind,' says יהוה. 'I will not keep anger forever.
\v 13 Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against יהוה your Elohim, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed My voice,' says יהוה."
\p
\v 14 "Return, backsliding children," says יהוה; "for I am your owner. I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Tsion.
\v 15 I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
\v 16 It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days," says יהוה, "they shall say no more, 'The ark of the covenant of יהוה!' neither shall it come to heart; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.
\v 17 At that time they shall call Yerushalayim 'The throne of יהוה;' and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the Name of יהוה, to Yerushalayim. Neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
\v 18 In those days the house of Yehudah shall walk with the house of Yisra'el, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.
\p
\v 19 "But I said, 'How I would put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!' and I said, 'You shall call Me "My Father," and shall not turn away from following Me.'
\p
\v 20 "Surely as a wife deceitfully departs from her husband, so you have dealt deceitfully with Me, house of Yisra'el," says יהוה.
\p
\v 21 A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Yisra'el; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten יהוה their Elohim.
\v 22 Return, you backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding. "Behold, we have come to you; for you are יהוה our Elohim.
\v 23 Truly in vain is the help that is looked for from the hills, the tumult on the mountains. Truly the salvation of Yisra'el is in יהוה our Elohim.
\v 24 But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
\v 25 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against יהוה our Elohim, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed the voice of יהוה our Elohim."
\c 4
\p
\v 1 "If you will return, Yisra'el," says יהוה, "if you will return to Me, and if you will put away your abominations out of My sight; then you shall not be removed;
\v 2 and you shall swear, 'As יהוה lives,' in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness. The nations shall bless themselves in Him, and in Him shall they glory."
\p
\v 3 For thus says יהוה to the men of Yehudah and to Yerushalayim, "Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.
\v 4 Circumcise yourselves to יהוה, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Yehudah and inhabitants of Yerushalayim; lest My wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\v 5 Declare in Yehudah, and publish in Yerushalayim; and say, 'Blow the shofar in the land!' Cry aloud and say, 'Assemble yourselves! Let us go into the fortified cities!'
\v 6 Set up a standard toward Tsion. Flee for safety! Do not wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction."
\p
\v 7 A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.
\v 8 For this clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of יהוה has not turned back from us.
\p
\v 9 "It shall happen at that day," says יהוה, "that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder."
\p
\v 10 Then I said, "Ah, Adonai יהוה! Surely You have greatly deceived this people and Yerushalayim, saying, 'You shall have peace;' whereas the sword reaches to the being."
\p
\v 11 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Yerushalayim, "A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of My people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;
\v 12 a full wind from these shall come for Me. Now I will also utter judgments against them."
\p
\v 13 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.
\v 14 Yerushalayim, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your thoughts of vain exertion lodge within you?
\p
\v 15 For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims vain exertion from the Mount of Ephrayim:
\v 16 "Tell the nations; behold, proclaim against Yerushalayim, 'Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Yehudah.
\v 17 As guards of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against Me,'" says יהוה.
\v 18 "Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart."
\p
\v 19 My gut, my gut! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because you have heard, O my being, the sound of the shofar, the alarm of war.
\v 20 Destruction on destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, my curtains in a moment.
\v 21 How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the shofar?
\p
\v 22 "For My people are foolish, they do not know Me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but to do good they have no knowledge."
\p
\v 23 I saw the earth, and, behold, it was formless and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
\v 24 I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth.
\v 25 I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.
\v 26 I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of יהוה, before His fierce anger.
\p
\v 27 For thus says יהוה, "The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.
\v 28 For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not relented, neither will I turn back from it."
\p
\v 29 Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers; they go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.
\v 30 You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain do you make yourself beautiful; your lovers despise you, they seek your being.
\v 31 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Tsion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, "Woe is me now! For my being faints before the murderers."
\c 5
\p
\v 1 "Run back and forth through the streets of Yerushalayim, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places of it, if you can find a man, if there are any who do judgment, who seek faithfulness; and I will pardon her.
\p
\v 2 Though they say, 'As יהוה lives;' surely they swear falsely."
\p
\v 3 O יהוה, do Your eyes not look for faithfulness? You have stricken them, but they were not grieved. You have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction. They have made their faces harder than a rock. They have refused to return.
\p
\v 4 Then I said, "Surely these are poor. They are foolish; for they do not know the way of יהוה, the judgment of their Elohim.
\v 5 I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they know the way of יהוה, and the judgment of their Elohim." But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
\v 6 Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch against their cities; everyone who goes out there shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, their backsliding is increased.
\p
\v 7 "How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken Me, and sworn by what are no elohim. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the whores' houses.
\v 8 They were as fed horses roaming at large: everyone neighed after his neighbor's wife.
\v 9 Should I not punish them for these things?" says יהוה; "and should not my being be avenged on such a nation as this?
\v 10 "Go up on her walls, and destroy; but do not make a full end. Take away her branches; for they are not of יהוה.
\v 11 For the house of Yisra'el and the house of Yehudah have dealt very deceitfully against Me," says יהוה.
\p
\v 12 They have denied יהוה, and said, "It is not He; neither shall evil come on us; neither shall we see sword nor famine.
\v 13 The prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them."
\p
\v 14 Therefore thus says יהוה, Elohim Tsevaot, "Because you speak this word, behold, I will make My words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
\v 15 Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far, house of Yisra'el," says יהוה. "It is a mighty nation. It is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, neither understand what they say.
\v 16 Their quiver is an open tomb, they are all mighty men.
\v 17 They shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat. They shall eat up your flocks and your herds. They shall eat up your vines and your fig trees. They shall beat down your fortified cities, on which you rely, with the sword.
\p
\v 18 "But even in those days," says יהוה, "I will not make a full end with you.
\v 19 It will happen, when you say, 'Why has יהוה our Elohim done all these things to us?' Then you shall say to them, 'Just like you have forsaken Me, and served foreign elohim in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.'
\p
\v 20 "Declare this in the house of Ya'aqov, and publish it in Yehudah, saying,
\v 21 'Hear now this, foolish people, and without heart; who have eyes, and do not see; who have ears, and do not hear:
\v 22 Do you not fear Me?' says יהוה 'Will you not tremble at My presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? And though its waves toss themselves, yet they cannot prevail; though they roar, yet they cannot pass over it.'
\p
\v 23 "But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they have revolted and gone.
\v 24 Neither do they say in their heart, 'Let us now fear יהוה our Elohim, who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; who guards to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.'
\p
\v 25 "Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you.
\v 26 For among My people are found wicked men. They watch, as fowlers lie in wait. They set a trap. They catch men.
\v 27 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. Therefore they have become great, and grew rich.
\v 28 They have grown fat. They shine; yes, they excel in deeds of wickedness. They do not plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and they do not judge the judgment of the needy.
\p
\v 29 "Shall I not punish for these things?" says יהוה. "Shall not My being be avenged on such a nation as this?
\v 30 "An astonishing and horrible thing has happened in the land.
\v 31 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority; and My people love to have it so. What will you do in the end of it?
\c 6
\p
\v 1 "Flee for safety, you children of Benyamin, out of the midst of Yerushalayim, and blow the shofar in Teqoa, and raise up a signal on Beth Hakerem; for evil looks forth from the north, and a great destruction.
\v 2 The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Tsion, will I cut off.
\v 3 Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her all around; they shall feed everyone in his place."
\p
\v 4 "Prepare war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
\v 5 Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces."
\p
\v 6 For יהוה Tsevaot said, "Cut down trees, and cast up a mound against Yerushalayim: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
\v 7 As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before Me continually is sickness and wounds.
\v 8 Be disciplined, Yerushalayim, lest My being be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited."
\p
\v 9 Thus says יהוה Tsevaot, "They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Yisra'el like a vine. Turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets."
\p
\v 10 To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot listen. Behold, the word of יהוה has become a reproach to them. They have no delight in it.
\v 11 Therefore I am full of the wrath of יהוה. I am weary with holding in. "Pour it out on the children in the street, and on the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him who is full of days.
\v 12 Their houses shall be turned to others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out My hand on the inhabitants of the land, says יהוה."
\p
\v 13 "For from the least of them even to the greatest of them, everyone is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely.
\v 14 They have healed also the hurt of My people superficially, saying, 'Peace, peace!' when there is no peace.
\v 15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I visit them, they shall be cast down," says יהוה.
\p
\v 16 Thus says יהוה, "Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, 'Where is the good way?' and walk in it, and you will find rest for your beings. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'
\v 17 I set watchmen over you, saying, 'Listen to the sound of the shofar!' But they said, 'We will not listen!'
\v 18 Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.
\p
\v 19 "Hear, earth! Behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to My words; and as for My Torah, they have rejected it.
\v 20 Why does frankincense come to Me from Sheva, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your ascension offerings are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to Me."
\p
\v 21 Therefore thus says יהוה, "Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people. The fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them. The neighbor and his friend shall perish."
\p
\v 22 Thus says יהוה, "Behold, a people comes from the north country. A great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
\v 23 They take hold of bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no compassion. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Tsion."
\p
\v 24 We have heard its report; our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
\p
\v 25 Do not go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, and terror, are on every side.
\v 26 Daughter of my people, clothe yourself with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes! Mourn, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come on us.
\p
\v 27 "I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among My people; that you may know and try their way.
\v 28 They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders; they are copper and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.
\v 29 The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.
\v 30 Men will call them rejected silver, because יהוה has rejected them."
\c 7
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, saying,
\v 2 "Stand in the gate of the house of יהוה, and proclaim there this word, and say, 'Hear the word of יהוה, all you of Yehudah, who enter in at these gates to bow down to יהוה."
\v 3 Thus says יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, "Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
\v 4 Do not rely on lying words, saying, 'the Temple of יהוה, the Temple of יהוה, the Temple of יהוה, are these.'
\v 5 For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if you thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor;
\v 6 if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other elohim to your own hurt:
\v 7 then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even forevermore.
\p
\v 8 "Behold, you rely on lying words that cannot profit.
\v 9 Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Ba'al, and walk after other elohim that you have not known,
\v 10 and come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My Name, and say, 'We are delivered'; that you may do all these abominations?
\v 11 Is this house, which is called by My Name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it," says יהוה.
\p
\v 12 "But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I caused My Name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of My people Yisra'el.
\v 13 Now, because you have done all these works, says יהוה, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear; and I called you, but you did not answer:
\v 14 therefore will I do to the house which is called by My Name, on which you rely, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
\v 15 I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephrayim.
\p
\v 16 "Therefore do not pray for this people, neither lift up a cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to Me; for I will not hear you.
\v 17 Do you not see what they do in the cities of Yehudah and in the streets of Yerushalayim?
\v 18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink offerings to other elohim, that they may provoke Me to anger.
\v 19 Do they provoke Me to anger?" Says יהוה; "Do they not provoke themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?"
\p
\v 20 Therefore thus says Adonai יהוה: "Behold, My anger and My wrath shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on animal, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched."
\p
\v 21 Thus says יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el: "Add your ascension offerings to your sacrifices, and eat meat.
\v 22 For I did not speak to your fathers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim, concerning ascension offerings or sacrifices:
\v 23 but this thing I commanded them, saying, 'Listen to My voice, and I will be your Elohim, and you shall be My people; and walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.'
\v 24 But they did not listen nor turn their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
\v 25 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Mitsrayim to this day, I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
\v 26 yet they did not listen to Me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers.
\p
\v 27 "You shall speak all these words to them; but they will not listen to you: you shall also call to them; but they will not answer you.
\v 28 You shall tell them, 'This is the nation that has not listened to the voice of יהוה their Elohim, nor received correction:' faithfulness has perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
\p
\v 29 "Cut off your hair, Yerushalayim, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for יהוה has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.
\v 30 For the children of Yehudah have done that which is evil in My sight," says יהוה: "they have set their abominations in the House which is called by My Name, to defile it.
\v 31 They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I did not command, nor did it come into My heart."
\p
\v 32 "Therefore, behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but The Valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, until there be no place to bury.
\v 33 The dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the animals of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.
\v 34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Yehudah, and from the streets of Yerushalayim, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste."
\c 8
\p
\v 1 "At that time," says יהוה, "they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Yehudah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, out of their graves;
\v 2 and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the army of the heavens, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and to which they have bowed down: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung on the surface of the earth.
\v 3 Death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them," says יהוה Tsevaot.
\p
\v 4 "Moreover you shall tell them, 'Thus says יהוה: Shall men fall, and not rise up again? Shall one turn away, and not return?
\v 5 Why then has this people of Yerushalayim slid back by a perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
\v 6 I listened and heard, but they did not speak aright: no man repents him of his wickedness, saying, "What have I done?" Everyone turns to his course, as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle.
\p
\v 7 Yes, the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane guard the time of their coming; but My people do not know the judgment of יהוה.
\v 8 How do you say, "We are wise, and the Torah of יהוה is surely with us"? But behold, the false pen of the scribes has worked falsehood.
\v 9 The wise men are disappointed, they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have rejected the word of יהוה; and what kind of wisdom is in them?'"
\p
\v 10 "Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to those who shall possess them: for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.
\v 11 They have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, 'Peace, peace;' when there is no peace.
\v 12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among those who fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down," says יהוה.
\p
\v 13 "I will utterly consume them," says יהוה: "no grapes shall be on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them."
\p
\v 14 Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for יהוה our Elohim has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against יהוה.
\v 15 We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!
\v 16 The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembles; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those who dwell therein.
\p
\v 17 "For, behold, I will send naḥashim against you, adders, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you," says יהוה.
\p
\v 18 Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! My heart is faint within me.
\p
\v 19 "Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of My people from a land that is very far off: is not יהוה in Tsion? Is not her King in her? Why have they provoked Me to anger with their engraved images, and with foreign vanities?"
\p
\v 20 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
\v 21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay has taken hold on me.
\v 22 Is there no balm in Gilad? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a spring of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
\v 2 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! For they are all adulterers, an assembly of deceitful men.
\p
\v 3 "They bend their tongue, as it were their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for faithfulness: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know Me," says יהוה.
\p
\v 4 "Be on guard, every one of his neighbor, and do not rely on any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.
\v 5 They will deceive everyone his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity."
\p
\v 6 "Your habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know Me," says יהוה.
\v 7 Therefore thus says יהוה Tsevaot, "Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how else should I do, because of the daughter of My people?
\v 8 Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his insides he lays wait for him.
\v 9 Shall I not visit them for these things?" says יהוה; "Shall not My being be avenged on such a nation as this?"
\p
\v 10 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passes through; neither can men hear the voice of the livestock; both the birds of the heavens and the animals are fled, they are gone.
\p
\v 11 "I will make Yerushalayim heaps, a dwelling place of monsters; and I will make the cities of Yehudah a desolation, without inhabitant.
\p
\v 12 Who is the wise man that may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of יהוה has spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passes through?
\p
\v 13 יהוה says, 'Because they have forsaken My Torah which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice, neither walked therein,
\v 14 but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Ba'als, which their fathers taught them;'
\v 15 therefore thus says יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
\v 16 I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.'"
\p
\v 17 Thus says יהוה Tsevaot, "Consider, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skillful women, that they may come."
\p
\v 18 Let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
\v 19 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Tsion, "How are we ruined! We are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings."
\p
\v 20 Yet hear the word of יהוה, you women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and everyone her neighbor lamentation.
\v 21 For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from outside, and the young men from the streets.
\p
\v 22 "Speak," Thus says יהוה, "The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the handful after the harvester; and none shall gather them."
\p
\v 23 Thus says יהוה, "Do not let the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, do not let the rich man glory in his riches;
\v 24 but let him who glories glory in this, that he has understanding, and knows Me, that I am יהוה who exercises loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight," says יהוה.
\p
\v 25 "Behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that I will punish all those who are circumcised in their uncircumcision:
\v 26 Mitsrayim, and Yehudah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moav, and all those cast off to the corners, who dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Yisra'el are uncircumcised in heart."
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Hear the word which יהוה speaks to you, house of Yisra'el!
\p
\v 2 Thus says יהוה, "Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them.
\v 3 For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with a cutting tool.
\v 4 They decorate it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, so that it will not move.
\v 5 [They are like a post of turned work, and do not speak: they must be carried, because they cannot go. Do not be afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good."
\p
\v 6 There is none like You, יהוה; You are great, and Your Name is great in might.
\v 7 Who should not fear You, King of the nations? For it pertains to You; because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like You.
\v 8 But they are together stupid and foolish: the correction of idols! It is but a stock.]
\v 9 There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skillful men.
\v 10 But יהוה is the true Elohim; He is the living Elohim, and an everlasting King; at His wrath the earth trembles, and the nations are not able to withstand His indignation.
\p
\v 11 "You shall say this to them: 'The elohim that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.'"
\p
\v 12 He has made the earth by His power, He has established the world by His wisdom, and by His understanding has He stretched out the heavens:
\v 13 when He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of His treasuries.
\v 14 Every man is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\v 15 They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\v 16 The portion of Ya'aqov is not like these; for He is the former of all things; and Yisra'el is the tribe of His inheritance: יהוה Tsevaot is His Name.
\p
\v 17 "Gather up your wares out of the land, you who live under siege.
\v 18 For thus says יהוה, 'Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.'"
\p
\v 19 Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is grievous: but I said, "Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.
\v 20 My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are no more: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\v 21 For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of יהוה: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.
\v 22 The voice of news, behold, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Yehudah a desolation, a dwelling place of monsters."
\p
\v 23 יהוה, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
\v 24 יהוה, discipline me, but in judgment: not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing.
\v 25 Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You, and on the families that do not call on Your Name: for they have devoured Ya'aqov, yes, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, saying,
\v 2 "Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Yehudah, and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim;
\v 3 and say to them, 'Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el: "Cursed is the man who does not hear the words of this covenant,
\v 4 which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the iron furnace, saying, 'Obey My voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so you shall be My people, and I will be your Elohim;
\v 5 that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.'"'" Then I answered, and said, Amein, יהוה.
\p
\v 6 יהוה said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Yehudah, and in the streets of Yerushalayim, saying, 'Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.
\v 7 For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Mitsrayim, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, "Obey My voice."
\v 8 Yet they did not obey, nor turn their ear, but walked everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not do them.'"
\p
\v 9 יהוה said to me, "A conspiracy is found among the men of Yehudah, and among the inhabitants of Yerushalayim.
\v 10 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My words; and they are gone after other elohim to serve them: the house of Yisra'el and the house of Yehudah have broken My covenant which I cut with their fathers."
\p
\v 11 Therefore thus says יהוה, "Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry to Me, but I will not listen to them.
\v 12 Then shall the cities of Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim go and cry to the elohim to which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
\v 13 For according to the number of your cities are your elohim, Yehudah; and according to the number of the streets of Yerushalayim have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Ba'al.
\v 14 Therefore do not pray for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to Me because of their trouble."
\p
\v 15 "What has My beloved to do in My house, since she has worked lewdness with many, and the set-apart flesh is passed from you? When you do evil, then you rejoice.
\v 16 יהוה called your name, 'A green olive tree,' beautiful with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult He has kindled fire on it, and its branches are broken.
\v 17 For יהוה Tsevaot, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Yisra'el and of the house of Yehudah, which they have worked for themselves in provoking Me to anger by offering incense to Ba'al."
\p
\v 18 יהוה gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then You showed me their doings.
\v 19 But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I did not know that they had devised devices against me, saying, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered."
\p
\v 20 But, יהוה Tsevaot, who judges righteously, who tests the kidneys and the heart, I shall see Your vengeance on them; for to You have I revealed my cause.
\p
\v 21 Therefore thus says יהוה, "Concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your being, saying, 'You shall not prophesy in the Name of יהוה, that you not die by our hand;'
\v 22 therefore thus says יהוה Tsevaot, 'Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;
\v 23 and there shall be no remnant to them: for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.'"
\c 12
\p
\v 1 You are righteous, יהוה, when I contend with You; yet I would reason the judgments with You: why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all they at ease who deal very deceitfully?
\v 2 You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their kidneys.
\v 3 But You, יהוה, know me; You see me, and try my heart toward You: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
\v 4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell therein, the animals are consumed, and the birds; because they said, "He shall not see our latter end."
\p
\v 5 "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? And though in a land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride of the Yarden?
\v 6 For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt deceitfully with you; even they have cried aloud after you: do not trust them, though they speak beautiful words to you.
\v 7 I have forsaken My house, I have cast off My heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of My being into the hand of her enemies.
\v 8 My heritage is become to Me as a lion in the forest: she has uttered her voice against Me; therefore I have hated her.
\v 9 Is My heritage to Me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the animals of the field, bring them to devour.
\p
\v 10 "Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard, they have trodden My portion under foot, they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
\v 11 They have made it a desolation; it mourns to Me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.
\v 12 Destroyers are come on all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of יהוה devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.
\v 13 They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of יהוה."
\p
\v 14 Thus says יהוה against all My evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Yisra'el to inherit: "Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Yehudah from among them.
\v 15 It shall happen, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
\v 16 It shall happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of My people, to swear by My Name, as יהוה lives; even as they taught My people to swear by Ba'al; then shall they be built up in the midst of My people.
\v 17 But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it," says יהוה.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Thus says יהוה to me, "Go, and buy yourself a linen belt, and put it on your loins, and do not put it in water."
\p
\v 2 So I bought a belt according to the word of יהוה, and put it on my loins.
\p
\v 3 The word of יהוה came to me the second time, saying,
\v 4 "Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your loins, and arise, go to the Perath, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock."
\p
\v 5 So I went, and hid it by the Perath, as יהוה commanded me.
\v 6 It happened after many days, that יהוה said to me, "Arise, go to the Perath, and take the belt from there, which I commanded you to hide there."
\p
\v 7 Then I went to the Perath, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the belt was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
\p
\v 8 Then the word of יהוה came to me, saying,
\v 9 "Thus says יהוה, 'In this way I will mar the pride of Yehudah, and the great pride of Yerushalayim.
\v 10 This evil people, who refuse to hear My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other elohim to serve them, and to bow down to them, shall even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing.
\v 11 For as the belt clings to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cling to Me the whole house of Yisra'el and the whole house of Yehudah,'" says יהוה; "'That they may be to Me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.'
\p
\v 12 "Therefore you shall speak to them this word: Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'Every bottle shall be filled with wine:' and they shall tell you, 'Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?'
\v 13 Then you shall tell them, 'Thus says יהוה, "Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, with drunkenness.
\v 14 I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together," says יהוה: "I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them."'"
\p
\v 15 Hear, and give ear; do not be proud; for יהוה has spoken.
\v 16 Give glory to יהוה your Elohim, before He causes darkness, and before your feet stumble on the mountains of twilight, and, while you look for light, He turns it into the shadow of death, and makes it gross darkness.
\v 17 But if you will not hear it, my being shall weep in secret for your pride; and my eye shall weep bitterly, and run down with tears, because the flock of יהוה is taken captive.
\p
\v 18 "Say to the king and to the queen mother, 'Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headdresses have come down, even the crown of your glory.'"
\p
\v 19 "The cities of the South are closed up, and there is none to open them. Yehudah is carried away captive, all of it; it is entirely carried away captive.
\v 20 Lift up your eyes, and see those who come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?
\v 21 What will you say, when He shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you? Shall not sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?
\v 22 If you say in your heart, 'Why are these things come on me?' For the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence.
\v 23 Can the Kushite change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may you also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.
\p
\v 24 "Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passes away, by the wind of the wilderness.
\v 25 This is your lot, the portion measured to you from Me," says יהוה; "Because you have forgotten Me, and relied on falsehood.
\v 26 Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face, and your shame shall appear.
\v 27 I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries, and your neighing, the lewdness of your whoring, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, Yerushalayim! You will not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?"
\c 14
\p
\v 1 The word of יהוה that came to Yirmeyahu concerning the drought.
\p
\v 2 "Yehudah mourns, and its gates wither, they sit in black on the ground; and the cry of Yerushalayim is gone up.
\v 3 Their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are disappointed and confounded, and cover their heads.
\v 4 Because of the ground which is cracked, because no rain has been in the land, the plowmen are disappointed, they cover their heads.
\v 5 Yes, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes her young, because there is no grass.
\v 6 The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like monster; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage."
\p
\v 7 Though our iniquities testify against us, work for Your Name's sake, יהוה; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against You.
\v 8 You are the hope of Yisra'el, its Savior in the time of trouble, why should You be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?
\v 9 Why should You be like a scared man, as a mighty man who cannot save? Yet You, יהוה, are in the midst of us, and we are called by Your Name; do not leave us.
\p
\v 10 Thus says יהוה to this people, "Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore יהוה does not accept them; now He will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins."
\p
\v 11 יהוה said to me, "Do not pray for this people for their good.
\v 12 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer ascension offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence."
\p
\v 13 Then I said, "Ah, Adonai יהוה! Behold, the prophets tell them, 'You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.'
\v 14 Then יהוה said to me, 'The prophets prophesy lies in My Name; I did not send them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.
\v 15 Therefore thus says יהוה concerning the prophets who prophesy in My Name, and I did not send them, yet they say, "Sword and famine shall not be in this land:" By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
\v 16 The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Yerushalayim because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them—them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.'"
\p
\v 17 "You shall say this word to them, 'Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.'"
\v 18 If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who are sick with famine! For both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.
\v 19 Have You utterly rejected Yehudah? Has Your being loathed Tsion? Why have You struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!
\v 20 We acknowledge, יהוה, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against You.
\v 21 Do not abhor us, for Your Name's sake; do not disgrace the throne of Your glory: remember, do not break Your covenant with us.
\v 22 Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Are You not He, יהוה our Elohim? Therefore we will wait for You; for You have made all these things.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then יהוה said to me, "Though even if Mosheh and Shemu'el stood before Me, yet My mind would not be toward this people: cast them out of My sight, and let them go forth.
\v 2 It shall happen, when they tell you, 'Where shall we go forth?' Then you shall tell them, 'Thus says יהוה: such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.'
\p
\v 3 "I will appoint over them four kinds," says יהוה: "The sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the heavens, and the animals of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
\v 4 I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Menasheh, the son of Ḥizqiyahu, king of Yehudah, for that which he did in Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 5 "For who will have pity on you, Yerushalayim? Or who will pity you? Or who will turn aside to ask of your welfare?
\v 6 You have rejected Me," says יהוה, "You have gone backward: therefore have I stretched out My hand against you, and destroyed you; I am weary with repenting.
\v 7 I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved them of children, I have destroyed My people; they did not return from their ways.
\p
\v 8 "Their widows are increased to Me above the sand of the seas; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly.
\v 9 She who has borne seven withers; she has given up the being; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she has been disappointed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies," says יהוה.
\p
\v 10 Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; yet every one of them does curse me.
\p
\v 11 יהוה said, "Most certainly I will strengthen you for good; most certainly I will cause the enemy to make prayer to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
\v 12 Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and copper?
\v 13 Your substance and your treasures will I give for plunder without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.
\v 14 I will make them to pass with your enemies into a land which you do not know; for a fire is kindled in My anger, which shall burn on you."
\p
\v 15 יהוה, You know; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; do not take me away in Your longsuffering: know that for Your sake I have suffered reproach.
\v 16 Your words were found, and I ate them; and Your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by Your Name, יהוה, Elohim Tsevaot.
\p
\v 17 I did not sit in the assembly of those who make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of Your hand; for You have filled me with indignation.
\v 18 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? Will You indeed be to me as a deceitful brook, as faithful waters?
\p
\v 19 Therefore thus says יהוה, "If you return, then I will bring you again, that you may stand before Me; and if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as My mouth: they shall return to you, but you shall not return to them.
\v 20 I will make you to this people a fortified copper wall; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you," says יהוה.
\v 21 "I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the tyrant."
\c 16
\p
\v 1 The word of יהוה came also to me, saying,
\v 2 "You shall not take a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters, in this place.
\v 3 For thus says יהוה concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers who brought forth them in this land:
\v 4 They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung on the surface of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the animals of the earth."
\p
\v 5 For thus says יהוה, "Do not enter into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither pity them; for I have taken away My peace from this people," says יהוה, "Even loving-kindness and compassions.
\v 6 Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;
\v 7 neither shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
\v 8 You shall not go into the house of banquets to sit with them, to eat and to drink."
\p
\v 9 For thus says יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el: "Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
\p
\v 10 "It shall happen, when you shall show this people all these words, and they shall tell you, 'Why has יהוה pronounced all this great evil against us? Or what is our iniquity? Or what is our sin that we have committed against יהוה our Elohim?'
\v 11 Then you shall tell them, 'Because your fathers have forsaken Me,' says יהוה, 'and have walked after other elohim, and have served them, and have bowed down to them, and have forsaken Me, and have not guarded My Torah;
\v 12 and you have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you do not listen to Me:
\v 13 therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other elohim day and night; for I will show you no favor.
\p
\v 14 "Therefore, behold, the days come," says יהוה, "That it shall no more be said, 'As יהוה lives, who brought up the children of Yisra'el out of the land of Mitsrayim;'
\v 15 but, 'As יהוה lives, who brought up the children of Yisra'el from the land of the north, and from all the countries where He had driven them.' I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.
\p
\v 16 "Behold, I will send for many fishermen," says יהוה, "And they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
\v 17 For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, neither is their iniquity concealed from My eyes.
\v 18 First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted My land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled My inheritance with their abominations."
\p
\v 19 יהוה, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to You shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, "Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, even vanity and things in which there is no profit."
\p
\v 20 "Shall a man make to himself elohim, which yet are not elohim at all?
\v 21 Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know My hand and My might; and they shall know that My Name is יהוה."
\c 17
\p
\v 1 "The sin of Yehudah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of your altars;
\v 2 while their children remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees on the high hills.
\v 3 My mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your treasures for a plunder, and your high places, because of sin, throughout all your borders.
\v 4 You, even of yourself, shall discontinue from your heritage that I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you do not know: for you have kindled a fire in My anger which shall burn forever."
\p
\v 5 Thus says יהוה: "Cursed is the man who relies on man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from יהוה.
\v 6 For he shall be like the shrub in the desert, and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.
\v 7 Blessed is the man who relies on יהוה, and whose confidence is יהוה.
\v 8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, who spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat comes, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
\p
\v 9 "The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it?
\v 10 I, יהוה, search the heart, I try the kidneys, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.
\p
\v 11 "As the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid, so is he who gets riches, and not by judgment; in the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool."
\p
\v 12 A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our set-apart place.
\p
\v 13 יהוה, the hope of Yisra'el, all who forsake You shall be disappointed. "Those who depart from Me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken יהוה, the spring of living waters."
\p
\v 14 Heal me, O יהוה, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for You are my praise.
\v 15 Behold, they tell me, "Where is the word of יהוה? Let it come now."
\p
\v 16 As for me, I have not hurried from being a shepherd after You; neither have I desired the woeful day; You know: that which came out of my lips was before Your face.
\v 17 Do not be a terror to me: You are my refuge in the day of evil.
\v 18 Let them be disappointed who persecute me, but let not me be disappointed; let them be dismayed, but do not let me be dismayed; bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
\p
\v 19 Thus said יהוה to me: "Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, through which the kings of Yehudah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Yerushalayim;
\v 20 and tell them, 'Hear the word of יהוה, you kings of Yehudah, and all Yehudah, and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, that enter in by these gates:
\v 21 Thus says יהוה, 'Be on guard to yourselves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Yerushalayim;
\v 22 neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the set-apart Sabbath day, neither do any work: but set the Sabbath day apart, as I commanded your fathers.'
\v 23 But they did not listen, neither turn their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive correction."
\p
\v 24 "It shall happen, if you diligently listen to Me," says יהוה, "To bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to set the Sabbath day apart, to do no work therein;
\v 25 then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Yehudah, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim; and this city shall remain forever.
\v 26 They shall come from the cities of Yehudah, and from the places around Yerushalayim, and from the land of Benyamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill country, and from the South, bringing ascension offerings, and sacrifices, and meal offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving, to the House of יהוה.
\p
\v 27 "But if you will not listen to Me to set the Sabbath day apart, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Yerushalayim on the Sabbath day; then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Yerushalayim, and it shall not be quenched."
\c 18
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, saying,
\v 2 "Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear My words."
\p
\v 3 Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was making something on the wheels.
\v 4 When the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
\p
\v 5 Then the word of יהוה came to me, saying,
\v 6 "House of Yisra'el, can I not do with you as this potter?" says יהוה. "Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, house of Yisra'el.
\v 7 At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;
\v 8 if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from their evil, I will relent of the evil that I thought to do to them.
\v 9 At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
\v 10 if they do that which is evil in My sight, that they not obey My voice, then I will relent of the good with which I said I would benefit them.
\p
\v 11 "Now therefore, speak to the men of Yehudah, and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, saying, 'יהוה says: "Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a plan against you. Everyone return from his evil way now, and amend your ways and your doings."'
\v 12 But they say, 'It is in vain; for we will walk after our own plans, and we will each follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.'"
\p
\v 13 Therefore יהוה says: "Ask now among the nations, 'Who has heard such things?' The virgin of Yisra'el has done a very horrible thing.
\v 14 Will the snow of Levanon fail from the rock of the field? Will the cold waters that flow down from a strange place be dried up?
\v 15 For My people have forgotten Me. They have burned incense to false elohim. They have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in byways, in a way not built up;
\v 16 to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing. Everyone who passes thereby will be astonished, and shake his head.
\v 17 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy. I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
\p
\v 18 Then they said, "Come, and let us devise plans against Yirmeyahu; for the Torah will not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words."
\p
\v 19 Give heed to me, יהוה, and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.
\v 20 Should evil be recompensed for good? For they have dug a pit for my being. Remember how I stood before You to speak good for them, to turn away Your wrath from them.
\v 21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives become childless, and widows. Let their men be killed, and their young men struck by the sword in battle.
\v 22 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when You bring a troop suddenly on them; for they have dug a pit to take me, and hidden snares for my feet.
\v 23 Yet, יהוה, You know all their counsel against me to kill me. Do not atone for their iniquity. Do not blot out their sin from Your sight; let them be overthrown before You. Deal with them in the time of Your anger.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Thus said יהוה, "Go, and buy a potter's earthen bottle, and take some of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;
\v 2 and go out to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I will tell you.
\p
\v 3 "Say, 'Hear the word of יהוה, kings of Yehudah, and inhabitants of Yerushalayim: יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el says, "Behold, I will bring evil on this place, which whoever hears, his ears will tingle.
\v 4 Because they have forsaken Me, and have defiled this place, and have burned incense in it to other elohim, that they did not know, they and their fathers and the kings of Yehudah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
\v 5 and have built the high places of Ba'al, to burn their sons in the fire for ascension offerings to Ba'al; which I did not command, nor speak, which did not even enter into My heart:
\v 6 therefore, behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that this place will no more be called 'Topheth', nor 'The Valley of the Son of Hinnom', but 'The Valley of Slaughter'.
\p
\v 7 '"I will make the counsel of Yehudah and Yerushalayim void in this place. I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their being. I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the heavens and for the animals of the earth.
\v 8 I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.
\v 9 I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters. They will each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies, and those who seek their being, will distress them."'
\p
\v 10 "Then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who go with you,
\v 11 and shall tell them, 'יהוה Tsevaot says: "Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth, until there is no place to bury.
\v 12 Thus will I do to this place," says יהוה, "and to its inhabitants, even making this city as Topheth.
\v 13 The houses of Yerushalayim, and the houses of the kings of Yehudah, which are defiled, will be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the heavens, and have poured out drink offerings to other elohim."'
\p
\v 14 Then Yirmeyahu came from Topheth, where יהוה had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the house of יהוה, and said to all the people:
\v 15 "יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el says, 'Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear My words.'"
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Now Pashḥur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of יהוה, heard Yirmeyahu prophesying these things.
\v 2 Then Pashḥur struck Yirmeyahu the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benyamin, which was in the house of יהוה.
\v 3 On the next day, Pashḥur released Yirmeyahu out of the stocks. Then Yirmeyahu said to him, "יהוה has not called your name Pashḥur, but Magormissaviv.
\v 4 For יהוה says, 'Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will see it. I will give all Yehudah into the hand of the king of Bavel, and he will carry them captive to Bavel, and will kill them with the sword.
\v 5 Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all its precious things, yes, I will give all the treasures of the kings of Yehudah into the hand of their enemies. They will plunder them, take them, and carry them to Bavel.
\v 6 You, Pashḥur, and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity. You will come to Bavel, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.'"
\p
\v 7 יהוה, You have persuaded me, and I was persuaded. You are stronger than I, and have prevailed. I have become a laughing-stock all day. Everyone mocks me.
\v 8 For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, "Violence and destruction!" because the word of יהוה has been made a reproach to me, and a derision, all day.
\v 9 If I say, "I will not make mention of Him, or speak any more in His Name," then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire closed up in my bones, and I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot.
\v 10 For I have heard the defaming of many, "Terror on every side! Denounce, and we will denounce him!" say all my familiar friends, those who guard for my fall. "Perhaps he will be persuaded, and we will prevail against him, and we will take our revenge on him."
\p
\v 11 But יהוה who is with me is like a mighty tyrant. Therefore my persecutors will stumble, and they will not prevail. They will be utterly disappointed, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which will never be forgotten.
\v 12 But, יהוה Tsevaot, who tests the righteous, who sees the kidneys and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them; for to You I have revealed my cause.
\v 13 Sing to יהוה! Praise יהוה, for He has delivered the being of the needy from the hand of evildoers.
\p
\v 14 Cursed is the day in which I was born. Do not let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.
\v 15 Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying, "A boy is born to you," making him very glad.
\v 16 Let that man be as the cities which יהוה overthrew, and did not repent. Let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;
\v 17 because he did not kill me from the womb. So my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.
\v 18 Why did I come out of the womb to see toil and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
\c 21
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, when King Tsidqiyahu sent to him Pashḥur the son of Malkiyah, and Tsephanyah the son of Ma'aseiyah, the priest, saying,
\v 2 "Please inquire of יהוה for us; for Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel makes war against us. Perhaps יהוה will deal with us according to all His wondrous works, that he may withdraw from us."
\p
\v 3 Then Yirmeyahu said to them, "Tell Tsidqiyahu:
\v 4 'יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el says, "Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Bavel, and against the Kaldeans who besiege you outside the walls; and I will gather them into the middle of this city.
\v 5 I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation.
\v 6 I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and animal. They will die of a great pestilence.
\v 7 Afterward," says יהוה, "I will deliver Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah, his servants, and the people, even those who are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their being. He will strike them with the edge of the sword. He will not spare them, have pity, or have compassion."'
\p
\v 8 "You shall say to this people, 'יהוה says: "Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
\v 9 He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out, and passes over to the Kaldeans who besiege you, he will live, and his being will be to him a spoil.
\v 10 For I have set My face on this city for evil, and not for good," says יהוה. "It will be given into the hand of the king of Bavel, and he will burn it with fire."'
\p
\v 11 "Concerning the house of the king of Yehudah, hear the word of יהוה:
\v 12 House of David, יהוה says, 'Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest My wrath go out like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\v 13 Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, and of the rock of the plain,' says יהוה. 'You that say, "Who would come down against us?" Or "Who would enter into our homes?"
\v 14 I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says יהוה; and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it will devour all that is around her.'"
\c 22
\p
\v 1 יהוה said, "Go down to the house of the king of Yehudah, and speak this word, there:
\v 2 'Hear the word of יהוה, king of Yehudah, who sits on David's throne, you, your servants, and your people who enter in by these gates.
\v 3 יהוה says: "Execute judgment and righteousness, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor. Do no wrong. Do no violence to the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow. Do not shed innocent blood in this place.
\v 4 For if you do this thing indeed, then kings sitting on David's throne will enter in by the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people.
\v 5 But if you will not hear these words, I swear by Myself," says יהוה, "that this house will become a desolation."'"
\p
\v 6 For יהוה says concerning the house of the king of Yehudah: "You are Gilad to Me, the head of Levanon. Yet surely I will make you a wilderness, cities which are not inhabited.
\v 7 I will prepare destroyers against you, everyone with his weapons, and they will cut down your choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
\p
\v 8 "Many nations will pass by this city, and they will each ask his neighbor, 'Why has יהוה done this to this great city?'
\v 9 Then they will answer, 'Because they abandoned the covenant of יהוה their Elohim, bowed down to other elohim, and served them.'"
\p
\v 10 Do not weep for the dead. Do not pity him; but weep bitterly for him who goes away, for he will return no more, and not see his native country.
\v 11 For יהוה says touching Shallum the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah, who reigned instead of Yoshiyahu his father, and who went out of this place: "He will not return there anymore.
\v 12 But in the place where they have led him captive, there will he die, and he will see this land no more."
\p
\v 13 "Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his rooms without judgment; who uses his neighbor's service without wages, and does not give him his hire;
\v 14 who says, 'I will build myself a wide house and spacious rooms,' and cuts out windows for himself; with a cedar ceiling, and painted with red.
\p
\v 15 "Should you reign, because you strive to excel in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink, and do judgment and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
\v 16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; so it was well, then. Was this not to know me?" says יהוה.
\v 17 "But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness, for shedding innocent blood, for oppression, and for doing violence."
\p
\v 18 Therefore יהוה says concerning Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah: "They will not lament for him, saying, 'Ah my brother!' or, 'Ah sister!' They will not lament for him, saying 'Ah master!' or, 'Ah his glory!'
\v 19 He will be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast out beyond the gates of Yerushalayim."
\p
\v 20 "Go up to Levanon, and cry. Lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Avarim; for all your lovers have been destroyed.
\v 21 I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, 'I will not listen.' This has been your way from your youth, that you did not obey My voice.
\v 22 The wind will feed all your shepherds, and your lovers will go into captivity. Surely then you will be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.
\v 23 Inhabitant of Levanon, who makes your nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs come on you, the pain as of a woman in travail!
\p
\v 24 "As I live," says יהוה, "though Konyahu the son of Yehoyaqim king of Yehudah were the signet on My right hand, yet would I pluck you from there.
\v 25 I would give you into the hand of those who seek your being, and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel, and into the hand of the Kaldeans.
\v 26 I will cast you out with your mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born; and there you will die.
\v 27 But to the land to which their being longs to return, there they will not return."
\p
\v 28 Is this man Konyahu a despised broken vessel? Is he a vessel in which no one delights? Why are they cast out, he and his seed, and cast into a land which they do not know?
\v 29 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of יהוה!
\v 30 יהוה says, "Record this man as childless, a man who will not prosper in his days; for no more will a man of his seed prosper, sitting on David's throne, and ruling in Yehudah."
\c 23
\p
\v 1 "Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture!" says יהוה.
\v 2 Therefore יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says against the shepherds who feed My people: "You have scattered My flock, driven them away, and have not visited them. Behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings," says יהוה.
\v 3 "I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they will be fruitful and multiply.
\v 4 I will set up shepherds over them, who will feed them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, neither will any be lacking," says יהוה.
\p
\v 5 "Behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and He will reign as king and deal wisely, and will execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
\v 6 In His days Yehudah will be saved, and Yisra'el will dwell securely. This is His Name by which He will be called: יהוה Tsidqeinu."
\p
\v 7 "Therefore behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that they will no more say, 'As יהוה lives, who brought up the children of Yisra'el out of the land of Mitsrayim;'
\v 8 but, 'As יהוה lives, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Yisra'el out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them.' Then they will dwell in their own land."
\p
\v 9 Concerning the prophets: my heart within me is broken. All my bones flutter. I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of יהוה, and because of His set-apart words.
\v 10 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of the curse the land mourns. The pastures of the wilderness have dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right;
\v 11 for both prophet and priest are profane. "Yes, in My house I have found their wickedness," says יהוה.
\p
\v 12 "Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness. They will be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their visitation," says יהוה.
\v 13 "I have seen unsavory things in the prophets of Shom'ron. They prophesied by Ba'al, and caused My people Yisra'el to err.
\v 14 In the prophets of Yerushalayim I have also seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one returns from his wickedness. They have all become to Me as Sedom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah."
\p
\v 15 Therefore יהוה Tsevaot says concerning the prophets: "Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Yerushalayim profaneness has gone out into all the land."
\p
\v 16 יהוה Tsevaot says, "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They teach you vanity. They speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of יהוה.
\v 17 They say continually to those who despise Me, 'יהוה has said, "You will have peace;"' and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, 'No evil will come on you.'
\v 18 For who has stood in the council of יהוה, that he should perceive and hear His word? Who has listened to My word, and heard it?
\v 19 Behold, the storm of יהוה, His wrath, has gone out. Yes, a whirling storm: It will burst on the head of the wicked.
\v 20 The anger of יהוה will not return until He has executed, and until He has performed the intents of his heart. In the latter days, you will understand it perfectly.
\v 21 I did not send these prophets, yet they ran. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.
\v 22 But if they had stood in My council, then they would have caused My people to hear My words, and would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
\p
\v 23 "Am I an Elohim at hand," says יהוה, "and not an Elohim far off?
\v 24 Can anyone hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him?" says יהוה. "Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?" says יהוה.
\p
\v 25 "I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in My Name, saying, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!'
\v 26 How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
\v 27 They intend to cause My people to forget My Name by their dreams which they each tell his neighbor, as their fathers forgot My Name because of Ba'al.
\v 28 The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has My word, let him speak My word in truth. What is the straw to the wheat?" says יהוה.
\v 29 "Is not My word like fire?" says יהוה; "and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
\p
\v 30 "Therefore behold, I am against the prophets," says יהוה, "who each steal My words from his neighbor.
\v 31 Behold, I am against the prophets," says יהוה, "who use their tongues, and say, 'He says.'
\v 32 Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams," says יהוה, "who tell them, and cause My people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting; yet I did not send them or command them. They do not profit this people at all," says יהוה.
\p
\v 33 "When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, 'What is the burden of יהוה?' Then you shall tell them, 'What burden? I will cast you off,' says יהוה.
\v 34 'As for the prophet, the priest, and the people, who say, 'The burden of יהוה,' I will even punish that man and his household.
\v 35 You will say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, 'What has יהוה answered?' and, 'What has יהוה said?'
\v 36 You will no longer remember the burden of יהוה: for every man's own word has become his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living Elohim, of יהוה Tsevaot, our Elohim."
\p
\v 37 "You will say to the prophet, 'What has יהוה answered you?' and, 'What has יהוה spoken?'
\v 38 Although you say, 'The burden of יהוה;' therefore יהוה says: 'Because you say this word, "The burden of יהוה," and I have sent to you, telling you not to say, "The burden of יהוה;"
\v 39 therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from My presence.
\v 40 I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which will not be forgotten.'"
\c 24
\p
\v 1 יהוה showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs were set before the Temple of יהוה, after Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel had carried away captive Yekonyahu the son of Yehoyaqim, king of Yehudah, and the princes of Yehudah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Yerushalayim, and had brought them to Bavel.
\v 2 One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
\p
\v 3 Then יהוה asked me, "What do you see, Yirmeyahu?" I said, "Figs. The good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten."
\p
\v 4 The word of יהוה came to me, saying,
\v 5 "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el says: 'Like these good figs, so I will regard the captives of Yehudah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Kaldeans, for good.
\v 6 For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land. I will build them, and not pull them down. I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
\v 7 I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am יהוה. They will be My people, and I will be their Elohim; for they will return to Me with their whole heart.
\v 8 As the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad,' surely יהוה says, 'So I will give up Tsidqiyahu the king of Yehudah, and his princes, and the remnant of Yerushalayim, who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 9 I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I will drive them.
\v 10 I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.'"
\c 25
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Yirmeyahu concerning all the people of Yehudah, in the fourth year of Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah (the same was the first year of Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel),
\v 2 which Yirmeyahu the prophet spoke to all the people of Yehudah, and to all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim:
\v 3 From the thirteenth year of Yoshiyahu the son of Amon, king of Yehudah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, the word of יהוה has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you have not listened.
\p
\v 4 יהוה has sent to you all His servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear)
\v 5 saying, "Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that יהוה has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forever more.
\v 6 Do not go after other elohim to serve them or bow down to them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands; then I will do you no harm."
\p
\v 7 "Yet you have not listened to Me," says יהוה; "that you may provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt."
\p
\v 8 Therefore יהוה Tsevaot says: "Because you have not heard My words,
\v 9 behold, I will send and take all the families of the north," says יהוה, "and I will send to Nevukhadnetsar the king of Bavel, My servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around. I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
\v 10 Moreover I will take the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness from them; the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
\v 11 This whole land will be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations will serve the king of Bavel seventy years.
\p
\v 12 "It will happen, when seventy years are complete, that I will punish the king of Bavel and that nation," says יהוה, "for their iniquity. I will make the land of the Kaldeans desolate forever.
\v 13 I will bring on that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Yirmeyahu has prophesied against all the nations.
\v 14 For many nations and great kings will make bondservants of them, even of them. I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands."
\p
\v 15 For יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says to me: "Take this cup of the wine of wrath at My hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.
\v 16 They will drink, and reel back and forth, and be insane, because of the sword that I will send among them."
\p
\v 17 Then took I the cup at the hand of יהוה, and made all the nations to drink, to whom יהוה had sent me:
\v 18 Yerushalayim, and the cities of Yehudah, with its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is today;
\v 19 Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim, with his servants, his princes, and all his people;
\v 20 and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of the Uts, all the kings of the Philistines, Ashqelon, Gaza, Eqron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
\v 21 Edom, Moav, and the children of Ammon;
\v 22 and all the kings of Tsor, all the kings of Tsidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;
\v 23 Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all those cast off to the corners;
\v 24 and all the kings of Aravia, all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness;
\v 25 and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
\v 26 and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface of the earth. The king of Sheshak will drink after them.
\p
\v 27 "You shall tell them, 'יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el says: "Drink, and be drunk; vomit, fall, and rise no more; because of the sword which I will send among you."'
\v 28 It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, 'יהוה Tsevaot says: "You shall surely drink.
\v 29 For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by My Name; and should you be utterly unpunished? You will not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says יהוה Tsevaot."'
\p
\v 30 "Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and tell them, "'יהוה will roar from on high, and utter His voice from His set-apart habitation. He will mightily roar against His fold. He will give a shout, as those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\v 31 A noise will come even to the end of the earth; for יהוה has a controversy with the nations. He will enter into judgment with all flesh. As for the wicked, He will give them to the sword,"' says יהוה."
\p
\v 32 יהוה Tsevaot says, "Behold, evil will go out from nation to nation, and a great storm will be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth."
\p
\v 33 The slain of יהוה will be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They will not be lamented. They will not be gathered or buried. They will be dung on the surface of the ground.
\v 34 Wail, you shepherds, and cry. Wallow in dust, you leader of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come, and you will fall like fine pottery.
\p
\v 35 The shepherds will have no way to flee. The leader of the flock will have no escape.
\p
\v 36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the leader of the flock, for יהוה destroys their pasture.
\v 37 The peaceful folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of יהוה.
\v 38 He has left His den, as the lion; for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression, and because of His fierce anger.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah, this word came from יהוה.
\v 2 יהוה says, 'Stand in the court of the House of יהוה, and speak to all the cities of Yehudah, which come to bow down in the house of יהוה, all the words that I command you to speak to them. Do not omit a word.
\v 3 It may be they will listen, and every man turn from his evil way; that I may relent from the evil which I intend to do to them because of the evil of their doings.'
\v 4 You shall tell them, "יהוה says: 'If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My Torot, which I have set before you,
\v 5 to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them, but you have not listened;
\v 6 then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth."'"
\p
\v 7 The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Yirmeyahu speaking these words in the house of יהוה.
\v 8 When Yirmeyahu had finished speaking all that יהוה had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, "You shall surely die!
\v 9 Why have you prophesied in the Name of יהוה, saying, 'This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant?'" All the people were crowded around Yirmeyahu in the house of יהוה.
\p
\v 10 When the princes of Yehudah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of יהוה; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of the house of יהוה.
\v 11 Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, "This man is judged worthy of death; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears."
\p
\v 12 Then Yirmeyahu spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, "יהוה sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
\v 13 Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of יהוה your Elohim; then יהוה will relent from the evil that He has pronounced against you.
\v 14 But as for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me what is good and right in your eyes.
\v 15 Only know for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for in truth יהוה has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears."
\p
\v 16 Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets: "This man is not judged worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the Name of יהוה our Elohim."
\p
\v 17 Then certain of the elders of the land rose up, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
\v 18 "Mikhah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Ḥizqiyahu king of Yehudah; and he spoke to all the people of Yehudah, saying, 'יהוה Tsevaot says:
\p
\ms "'Tsion will be plowed as a field, and Yerushalayim will become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.'
\v 19 Did Ḥizqiyahu king of Yehudah and all Yehudah put him to death? Did he not fear יהוה, and entreat the favor of יהוה, and יהוה relented of the disaster which he had pronounced against them? We would commit great evil against our own beings that way!"
\p
\v 20 There was also a man who prophesied in the Name of יהוה, Uriyahu the son of Shemayahu of Qiryath Yearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Yirmeyahu.
\v 21 When Yehoyaqim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriyahu heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Mitsrayim.
\v 22 Then Yehoyaqim the king sent men into Mitsrayim, Elnathan the son of Akbor, and certain men with him, into Mitsrayim;
\v 23 and they fetched Uriyahu out of Mitsrayim, and brought him to Yehoyaqim the king, who killed him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
\p
\v 24 But the hand of Aḥiqam the son of Shaphan was with Yirmeyahu, so that they did not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah, this word came to Yirmeyah from יהוה, saying,
\v 2 יהוה says to me: "Make bonds and bars, and put them on your neck.
\v 3 Then send them to the king of Edom, to the king of Moav, to the king of the children of Ammon, to the king of Tsor, and to the king of Tsidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Yerushalayim to Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah.
\v 4 Give them a command to their masters, saying, 'יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el says, "You shall tell your masters:
\v 5 'I have made the earth, the men, and the animals that are on the surface of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched Arm. I give it to whom it seems right to Me.
\v 6 Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nevukhadnetsar the king of Bavel, My servant. I have also given the animals of the field to him to serve him.
\v 7 All the nations will serve him, his son, and his son's son, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings will make him their bondservant.
\p
\v 8 '"'It will happen that I will punish the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Bavel,' says יהוה, 'with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
\v 9 But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, to your diviners, to your dreams, to your soothsayers, or to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, "You shall not serve the king of Bavel;"
\v 10 for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, so that I would drive you out, and you would perish.
\v 11 But the nation that brings their neck under the yoke of the king of Bavel and serves him, that nation I will let remain in their own land,' says יהוה; 'and they will till it and dwell in it.'"'
\p
\v 12 I spoke to Tsidqiyah king of Yehudah according to all these words, saying, "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Bavel, and serve him and his people, and live.
\v 13 Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as יהוה has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Bavel?
\v 14 Do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, 'You shall not serve the king of Bavel;' for they prophesy a lie to you.
\v 15 For I have not sent them," says יהוה, "but they prophesy falsely in My Name; that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you."
\p
\v 16 Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, יהוה says, "Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, 'Behold, the vessels of the house of יהוה will now shortly be brought again from Bavel;' for they prophesy a lie to you.
\v 17 Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Bavel, and live. Why should this city become a desolation?
\v 18 But if they are prophets, and if the word of יהוה is with them, let them now make intercession to יהוה Tsevaot, that the vessels which are left in the house of יהוה, in the house of the king of Yehudah, and at Yerushalayim, do not go to Bavel.
\p
\v 19 For יהוה Tsevaot says concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
\v 20 which Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel did not take when he carried away captive Yekonyah the son of Yehoyaqim, king of Yehudah, from Yerushalayim to Bavel, and all the nobles of Yehudah and Yerushalayim;
\v 21 yes, יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says concerning the vessels that are left in the house of יהוה, and in the house of the king of Yehudah, and at Yerushalayim:
\v 22 'They will be carried to Bavel, and there they will be, until the day that I visit them,' says יהוה; 'then I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.'"
\c 28
\p
\v 1 That same year, in the beginning of the reign of Tsidqiyah king of Yehudah, in the fourth year, in the fifth new moon, Ḥananyah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Givon, spoke to me in the house of יהוה, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
\v 2 "יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says, 'I have broken the yoke of the king of Bavel.
\v 3 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the house of יהוה, that Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel took away from this place, and carried to Bavel.
\v 4 I will bring again to this place Yekonyah the son of Yehoyaqim, king of Yehudah, with all the captives of Yehudah, who went to Bavel,' says יהוה; 'for I will break the yoke of the king of Bavel.'"
\p
\v 5 Then the prophet Yirmeyah said to the prophet Ḥananyah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of יהוה,
\v 6 even the prophet Yirmeyah said, "Amein! May יהוה do so. May יהוה perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the house of יהוה, and all those who are captives, from Bavel to this place.
\v 7 Nevertheless listen now to this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people:
\v 8 The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence.
\v 9 The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet happens, then the prophet will be known, that יהוה has truly sent him."
\p
\v 10 Then Ḥananyah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Yirmeyah's neck, and broke it.
\v 11 Ḥananyah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "יהוה says: 'Even so I will break the yoke of Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.'" Then the prophet Yirmeyah went his way.
\p
\v 12 Then the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyah, after Ḥananyah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Yirmeyah, saying,
\v 13 "Go, and tell Ḥananyah, saying, 'יהוה says, "You have broken the bars of wood, but you have made in their place bars of iron."
\v 14 For יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el says, "I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel; and they will serve him. I have also given him the animals of the field."'"
\p
\v 15 Then the prophet Yirmeyah said to Ḥananyah the prophet, "Listen, Ḥananyah! יהוה has not sent you, but you make this people rely on a lie.
\v 16 Therefore יהוה says, 'Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth. This year you will die, because you have spoken rebellion against יהוה.'"
\p
\v 17 So Ḥananyah the prophet died the same year in the seventh new moon.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Now these are the words of the letter that Yirmeyah the prophet sent from Yerushalayim to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nevukhadnetsar had carried away captive from Yerushalayim to Bavel,
\v 2 (after Yekonyah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Yehudah and Yerushalayim, the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Yerushalayim),
\v 3 by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemaryah the son of Ḥilqyah, (whom Tsidqiyah king of Yehudah sent to Bavel to Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel). It said:
\p
\v 4 יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Yerushalayim to Bavel:
\v 5 "Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit.
\v 6 Take wives and father sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there, and do not be diminished.
\v 7 Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to יהוה for it; for in its peace you will have peace."
\v 8 For יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el says: "Do not let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you. Do not listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.
\v 9 For they prophesy falsely to you in My Name. I have not sent them," says יהוה.
\p
\v 10 For יהוה says, "After seventy years are accomplished for Bavel, I will visit you and perform My good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
\v 11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you," says יהוה, "thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expectancy and a future.
\v 12 You shall call on Me, and you shall go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.
\v 13 You shall seek Me, and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.
\v 14 I will be found by you," says יהוה, "and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says יהוה. I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive."
\p
\v 15 Because you have said, "יהוה has raised us up prophets in Bavel;"
\v 16 יהוה says concerning the king who sits on David's throne, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who have not gone with you into captivity;
\v 17 יהוה Tsevaot says: "Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
\v 18 I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,
\v 19 because they have not listened to My words," says יהוה, "with which I sent to them My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear," says יהוה.
\p
\v 20 Hear therefore the word of יהוה, all you captives, whom I have sent away from Yerushalayim to Bavel.
\v 21 יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says concerning Aḥav the son of Qolayah, and concerning Tsidqiyahu the son of Ma'aseiyah, who prophesy a lie to you in My Name: "Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel; and he will kill them before your eyes.
\v 22 A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Yehudah who are in Bavel, saying, 'יהוה make you like Tsidqiyahu and like Aḥav, whom the king of Bavel roasted in the fire;'
\v 23 because they have done senseless things in Yisra'el, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken words in My Name falsely, which I did not command them. I am He who knows, and am witness," says יהוה.
\p
\v 24 Concerning Shemayahu the Neḥelamite you shall speak, saying,
\v 25 "יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says, 'Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Yerushalayim, and to Tsephanyah the son of Ma'aseiyah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
\v 26 "יהוה has made you priest in the place of Yehoyada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of יהוה, for every man who is crazy, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.
\v 27 Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Yirmeyahu of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,
\v 28 because he has sent to us in Bavel, saying, the captivity is long. Build houses, and dwell in them. Plant gardens, and eat their fruit?"'"
\p
\v 29 Tsephanyah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Yirmeyahu the prophet.
\v 30 Then the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying,
\v 31 "Send to all of the captives, saying, 'יהוה says concerning Shemayahu the Neḥelamite: "Because Shemayahu has prophesied to you, and I did not send him, and he has caused you to rely on a lie;"
\v 32 therefore יהוה says, "Behold, I will punish Shemayahu the Neḥelamite and his seed. He will not have a man to dwell among this people. He will not see the good that I will do to My people," says יהוה, "because he has spoken rebellion against יהוה."'"
\c 30
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, saying,
\v 2 "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says, 'Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.
\v 3 For, behold, the days come,' says יהוה, 'that I will reverse the captivity of My people Yisra'el and Yehudah,' says יהוה. 'I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.'"
\p
\v 4 These are the words that יהוה spoke concerning Yisra'el and concerning Yehudah.
\p
\v 5 For יהוה says: "We have heard a voice of trembling; a voice of fear, and not of peace.
\v 6 Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child. Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned pale?
\v 7 Alas! For that day is great, so that none is like it. It is even the time of Ya'aqov's trouble; but he will be saved out of it.
\v 8 It will come to pass in that day," says יהוה Tsevaot, "that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds. Strangers will no more make them their bondservants;
\v 9 but they will serve יהוה their Elohim, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.
\p
\v 10 "Therefore do not be afraid, O Ya'aqov My servant," says יהוה. "Do not be dismayed, Yisra'el. For, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity. Ya'aqov will return, and will be quiet and at ease. No one will make him afraid.
\v 11 For I am with you," says יהוה, "to save you; for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will discipline you in judgment, and will in no way leave you unpunished."
\p
\v 12 For יהוה says, "Your hurt is incurable. Your wound is grievous.
\v 13 There is no one to plead your cause, that you may be bound up. You have no healing medicines.
\v 14 All your lovers have forgotten you. They do not seek you. For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the correction of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased.
\v 15 Why do you cry over your injury? Your pain is incurable. For the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins have increased, I have done these things to you.
\p
\v 16 Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured. All your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity. Those who spoil you will be spoil. I will make all who plunder you become plunder.
\v 17 For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds," says יהוה; "because they have called you an outcast, saying, 'It is Tsion, whom no man seeks after.'"
\p
\v 18 יהוה says: "Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Ya'aqov's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling places. The city will be built on its own hill, and the palace will stand according to its judgment.
\v 19 Thanksgiving will proceed out of them with the voice of those who make merry. I will multiply them, and they will not be few; I will also glorify them, and they will not be small.
\v 20 Their children also will be as before, and their congregation will be established before Me. I will punish all who oppress them.
\v 21 Their prince will be one of them, and their ruler will proceed from among them. I will cause Him to draw near, and He will approach to Me; for who is He who has dares in his heart to approach to Me?" says יהוה.
\p
\v 22 "You shall be My people, and I will be your Elohim.
\v 23 Behold, the storm of יהוה, His wrath, has gone out, a sweeping storm: it will burst on the head of the wicked.
\v 24 The fierce anger of יהוה will not return until He has accomplished, and until He has performed the intentions of His heart. In the latter days you will understand it."
\c 31
\p
\v 1 "At that time," says יהוה, "I will be the Elohim of all the families of Yisra'el, and they will be My people."
\p
\v 2 יהוה says, "The people who survive the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Yisra'el, when I went to cause him to rest."
\p
\v 3 יהוה appeared of old to me, saying, "Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love. Therefore I have drawn you with loving-kindness.
\v 4 I will build you again, and you will be built, O virgin of Yisra'el. You will again be adorned with your tambourines, and will go out in the dances of those who make merry.
\v 5 Again you will plant vineyards on the mountains of Shom'ron. The planters will plant, and will enjoy its fruit.
\p
\v 6 For there will be a day that the watchmen on the hills of Ephrayim cry, 'Arise, and let us go up to Tsion to יהוה our Elohim.'"
\p
\v 7 For יהוה says, "Sing with gladness for Ya'aqov, and shout for the chief of the nations. Publish, praise, and say, 'יהוה, save your people, the remnant of Yisra'el!'
\v 8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, along with the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her who travails with child together. They will return as a great company.
\v 9 They will come with weeping. I will lead them with petitions. I will cause them to walk by wadis of waters, in a straight way in which they will not stumble; for I am a father to Yisra'el. Ephrayim is My firstborn.
\p
\v 10 "Hear the word of יהוה, you nations, and declare it in the distant islands. Say, 'He who scattered Yisra'el will gather him, and guard him, as a shepherd does his flock.'
\v 11 For יהוה has ransomed Ya'aqov, and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.
\p
\v 12 They will come and sing in the height of Tsion, and will flow to the goodness of יהוה, to the grain, to the new wine, to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd. Their being will be as a watered garden. They will not sorrow any more at all.
\v 13 Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance; the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
\v 14 I will satiate the being of the priests with fatness, and My people will be satisfied with My goodness," says יהוה.
\p
\v 15 יהוה says: "A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Raḥeil weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more."
\p
\v 16 יהוה says: "Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for your work will be rewarded," says יהוה. "They will come again from the land of the enemy.
\v 17 There is hope for your latter end," says יהוה. "Your children will come again to their own territory.
\v 18 I have surely heard Ephrayim grieving thus, 'You have disciplined me, and I was disciplined, as an untrained calf. Turn me, and I will be turned; for You are יהוה my Elohim.
\v 19 Surely after that I was turned. I repented. After that I was instructed. I struck my thigh. I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth.'
\p
\v 20 "Is Ephrayim My dear son? Is he a darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I still earnestly remember him. Therefore My gut yearns for him. I will surely have compassion on him," says יהוה.
\p
\v 21 "Set up road signs. Make guideposts. Set your heart toward the highway, even the way by which you went. Turn again, virgin of Yisra'el. Turn again to these your cities.
\v 22 How long will you go here and there, you backsliding daughter? For יהוה has created a new thing in the earth: a woman will encompass a man."
\p
\v 23 יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: "Yet again they will use this speech in the land of Yehudah and in its cities, when I reverse their captivity: 'יהוה bless you, habitation of righteousness, set-apart mountain.'
\v 24 Yehudah and all its cities will dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.
\v 25 For I have satiated the weary being, and I have replenished every sorrowful being."
\p
\v 26 On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.
\p
\v 27 "Behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that I will sow the house of Yisra'el and the house of Yehudah with the seed of man and with the seed of animal.
\v 28 It will happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant," says יהוה.
\v 29 "In those days they will say no more, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'
\v 30 But everyone will die for his own iniquity. Every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge.
\p
\v 31 "Behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that I will cut a new covenant with the house of Yisra'el, and with the house of Yehudah:
\v 32 not according to the covenant that I cut with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Mitsrayim; which covenant of Mine they broke, although I was an owner to them," says יהוה.
\p
\v 33 "But this is the covenant that I will cut with the house of Yisra'el after those days," says יהוה: I will put My Torah in their inward parts, and I will write it in their heart. I will be their Elohim, and they shall be My people.
\v 34 They will no longer each teach his neighbor, and every man teach his brother, saying, 'Know יהוה;' for they will all know Me, from their least to their greatest," says יהוה: "for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
\p
\v 35 יהוה, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar; יהוה Tsevaot is His Name, says:
\v 36 "If these ordinances depart from before Me," says יהוה, "then the seed of Yisra'el also will cease from being a nation before Me forever."
\p
\v 37 יהוה says: "If heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then I will also cast off all the seed of Yisra'el for all that they have done," says יהוה.
\p
\v 38 "Behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that the city will be built to יהוה from the tower of Ḥananel to the gate of the corner.
\v 39 The measuring line will go out further straight onward to the hill Garev, and will turn toward Goah.
\v 40 The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the wadi Qidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, will be set-apart to יהוה. It will not be plucked up or thrown down any more forever."
\c 32
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה in the tenth year of Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah, which was the eighteenth year of Nevukhadnetsar.
\v 2 Now at that time the king of Bavel's army was besieging Yerushalayim. Yirmeyahu the prophet was closed up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Yehudah's house.
\p
\v 3 For Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah had shut him up, saying, "Why do you prophesy, and say, 'יהוה says, "Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Bavel, and he will take it;
\v 4 and Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah will not escape out of the hand of the Kaldeans, but will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Bavel, and will speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes will see his eyes;
\v 5 and he will bring Tsidqiyahu to Bavel, and he will be there until I visit him," says יהוה: "though you fight with the Kaldeans, you will not prosper."'"
\p
\v 6 Yirmeyahu said, "The word of יהוה came to me, saying,
\v 7 'Behold, Ḥanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, "Buy my field that is in Anathoth; for the judgment of redemption is yours to buy it."'"
\p
\v 8 "So Ḥanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of יהוה, and said to me, 'Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benyamin; for the judgment of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours. Buy it for yourself.' "Then I knew that this was the word of יהוה.
\v 9 I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Ḥanamel my uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen sheqels of silver.
\v 10 I signed the deed, sealed it, called witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances to him.
\v 11 So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;
\v 12 and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Barukh the son of Neriyah, the son of Maḥseiyah, in the presence of Ḥanamel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Yehudim who sat in the court of the guard.
\p
\v 13 "I commanded Barukh before them, saying,
\v 14 'יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el says: "Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days."
\v 15 For יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el says: "Houses and fields and vineyards will yet again be bought in this land."'
\p
\v 16 "Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Barukh the son of Neriyah, I prayed to יהוה, saying,
\v 17 'Ah Adonai יהוה! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched Arm. There is nothing too hard for You,
\v 18 who shows loving-kindness to thousands, and repays the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty Elohim, יהוה Tsevaot is His Name;
\v 19 great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings;
\v 20 who performed signs and wonders in the land of Mitsrayim, even to this day, both in Yisra'el and among other men; and made Yourself a Name, as it is today;
\v 21 and brought Your people Yisra'el out of the land of Mitsrayim with signs, with wonders, with a strong hand, with an outstretched Arm, and with great terror;
\v 22 and gave them this land, which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
\v 23 and they came in, and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice and did not walk in Your Torah. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do. Therefore You have caused all this evil to come upon them.
\p
\v 24 "'Behold, siege ramps have come to the city to take it. The city is given into the hand of the Kaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, of the famine, and of the pestilence. What You have spoken has happened. Behold, You see it.
\v 25 You have said to me, Adonai יהוה, "Buy the field for money, and call witnesses;" whereas the city is given into the hand of the Kaldeans.'"
\p
\v 26 Then the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying,
\v 27 "Behold, I am יהוה, the Elohim of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?
\v 28 Therefore יהוה says: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Kaldeans, and into the hand of Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel, and he will take it.
\v 29 The Kaldeans, who fight against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Ba'al, and poured out drink offerings to other elohim, to provoke Me to anger.
\p
\v 30 "For the children of Yisra'el and the children of Yehudah have done only that which was evil in My sight from their youth; for the children of Yisra'el have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says יהוה.
\v 31 For this city has been to me a provocation of My anger and of My wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, so that I should remove it from before My face,
\v 32 because of all the evil of the children of Yisra'el and of the children of Yehudah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger: they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Yehudah, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim.
\v 33 They have turned their backs to Me, and not their faces. Although I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive correction.
\v 34 But they set their abominations in the House which is called by My Name, to defile it.
\v 35 They built the high places of Ba'al, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molekh; which I did not command them. It did not even come into My heart, that they should do this abomination, to cause Yehudah to sin."
\p
\v 36 Now therefore יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says concerning this city, about which you say, "It is given into the hand of the king of Bavel by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:"
\v 37 "Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in My anger, and in My wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place. I will cause them to dwell securely.
\v 38 Then they will be My people, and I will be their Elohim.
\v 39 I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for their good, and the good of their children after them.
\v 40 I will cut an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. I will put My fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from Me.
\v 41 Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with My whole heart and with My whole being."
\p
\v 42 For יהוה says: "Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them.
\v 43 Fields will be bought in this land, about which you say, 'It is desolate, without man or animal. It is given into the hand of the Kaldeans.'
\v 44 Men will buy fields for money, sign the deeds, seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benyamin, and in the places around Yerushalayim, in the cities of Yehudah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed," says יהוה.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu the second time, while he was still locked up in the court of the guard, saying,
\v 2 "יהוה who does it, יהוה who forms it to establish it—יהוה is His Name, says:
\v 3 'Call to Me, and I will answer you, and will show you great and difficult things, which you do not know.'
\v 4 For יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Yehudah, which are broken down to make a defense against the mounds and against the sword;
\v 5 while men come to fight with the Kaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in My anger and in My wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden My face from this city:
\v 6 'Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.
\v 7 I will cause the captivity of Yehudah and the captivity of Yisra'el to return, and will build them, as at the first.
\v 8 I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me. I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against Me and by which they have transgressed against Me.
\v 9 This city will be to Me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide to it.'"
\p
\v 10 יהוה says: "Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which you say, 'It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Yehudah, and in the streets of Yerushalayim, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,'
\v 11 the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, 'Give thanks to יהוה Tsevaot, for יהוה is good, for His loving-kindness endures forever;' who bring thanksgiving into the house of יהוה. For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed as at the first," says יהוה.
\p
\v 12 יהוה Tsevaot says: "Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
\v 13 In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benyamin, in the places around Yerushalayim, and in the cities of Yehudah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of him who counts them," says יהוה.
\p
\v 14 "Behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Yisra'el and concerning the house of Yehudah.
\p
\v 15 "In those days and at that time, I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David. He will execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
\v 16 In those days Yehudah will be saved, and Yerushalayim will dwell securely. This is the name by which she will be called: יהוה Tsidqeinu."
\p
\v 17 For יהוה says: "David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Yisra'el.
\v 18 The priests, the Levites shall not have a man cut off before Me to offer ascension offerings, to burn meal offerings, and to offer sacrifices continually."
\p
\v 19 The word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying,
\v 20 "יהוה says: 'If you can break My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their time;
\v 21 then may My covenant also be broken with David My servant, that he will not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, My ministers.
\v 22 As the army of the heavens cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot be measured; so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.'"
\p
\v 23 The word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying,
\v 24 "Do not consider what this people has spoken, saying, 'Has יהוה cast off the two families which He chose?' Thus they despise My people, that they should be no more a nation before them."
\v 25 יהוה says: "If My covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heavens and earth;
\v 26 then I will also cast away the seed of Ya'aqov, and of David My servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya'aqov: for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have compassion on them."
\c 34
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, when Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel, with all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Yerushalayim and against all its cities, saying:
\v 2 "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says, 'Go, and speak to Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah, and tell him, יהוה says, "Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Bavel and he will burn it with fire.
\v 3 You will not escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Bavel, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth. You will go to Bavel."'
\p
\v 4 "Yet hear the word of יהוה, O Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah: יהוה says concerning you, 'You will not die by the sword.
\v 5 You will die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will make a burning for you. They will lament you, saying, "Ah master!" for I have spoken the word,' says יהוה."
\p
\v 6 Then Yirmeyahu the prophet spoke all these words to Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah in Yerushalayim,
\v 7 when the king of Bavel's army was fighting against Yerushalayim, and against all the cities of Yehudah that were left, against Lakish and against Azeqah; for these alone remained of the cities of Yehudah as fortified cities.
\p
\v 8 The word came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, after King Tsidqiyahu cut a covenant with all the people who were at Yerushalayim, to proclaim liberty to them;
\v 9 that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that no one should make bondservants of them, of a Yehudite his brother.
\v 10 All the princes and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant go free, that no one should make bondservants of them any more. They obeyed and let them go;
\v 11 but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
\p
\v 12 Therefore the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, saying,
\v 13 "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'I cut a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the house of bondage, saying,
\v 14 'At the end of seven years, every man of you shall release his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years. You shall let him go free from you;' but your fathers did not listen to Me, and did not incline their ear.
\v 15 You had now turned, and had done that which is right in My eyes, in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor. You cut a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My Name;
\v 16 but you turned and profaned My Name, and every man caused his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free for their being, to return. You brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.'"
\p
\v 17 Therefore יהוה says: "You have not listened to Me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim to you a liberty," says יהוה, "to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine. I will make you be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.
\v 18 I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they cut before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts:
\v 19 the princes of Yehudah, the princes of Yerushalayim, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf.
\v 20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their being. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the heavens and for the animals of the earth.
\p
\v 21 "I will give Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah and his princes into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their being and into the hands of the king of Bavel's army, who has gone away from you.
\v 22 Behold, I will command," says יהוה, "and cause them to return to this city. They will fight against it, take it, and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Yehudah a desolation, without inhabitant."
\c 35
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה in the days of Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah, saying,
\v 2 "Go to the house of the Rekhavites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of יהוה, into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink."
\p
\v 3 Then I took Ya'azanyah the son of Yirmeyahu, the son of Ḥavatsanyah, with his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rekhavites;
\v 4 and I brought them into the house of יהוה, into the room of the sons of Ḥanan the son of Yigdalyahu, the man of Elohim, which was by the room of the princes, which was above the room of Ma'aseiyahu the son of Shallum, the guard of the threshold.
\v 5 I set before the sons of the house of the Rekhavites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, "Drink wine!"
\p
\v 6 But they said, "We will drink no wine; for Yonadav the son of Rekhav, our father, commanded us, saying, 'You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons, forever.
\v 7 You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, or have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land in which you live as nomads.'
\v 8 We have obeyed the voice of Yonadav the son of Rekhav, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;
\v 9 and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in. We have no vineyard, field, or seed;
\v 10 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Yonadav our father commanded us.
\v 11 But when Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel came up into the land, we said, 'Come, and let us go to Yerushalayim for fear of the army of the Kaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Arameans; so we will dwell at Yerushalayim.'"
\p
\v 12 Then the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying,
\v 13 "יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'Go and tell the men of Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, "Will you not receive correction, to listen to My words?" says יהוה.
\v 14 "The words of Yonadav the son of Rekhav that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father's command; but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, and you have not listened to Me.
\v 15 I have sent also to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, 'Every one of you must return now from his evil way, amend your doings, and do not go after other elohim to serve them, then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers:' but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to Me.
\v 16 The sons of Yonadav the son of Rekhav have performed the command of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to Me."'
\p
\v 17 "Therefore יהוה, Elohim Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'Behold, I will bring on Yehudah and on all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.'"
\p
\v 18 Yirmeyahu said to the house of the Rekhavites, "יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'Because you have obeyed the command of Yonadav your father, and guarded all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you;'
\v 19 therefore יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'Yonadav the son of Rekhav shall not have a man cut off to stand before Me forever.'"
\c 36
\p
\v 1 In the fourth year of Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah, this word came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, saying,
\v 2 "Take a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Yisra'el, and against Yehudah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Yoshiyahu, even to this day.
\v 3 It may be that the house of Yehudah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them; that they may each return from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."
\p
\v 4 Then Yirmeyahu called Barukh the son of Neriyahu; and Barukh wrote from the mouth of Yirmeyahu all of the words of יהוה, which He had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book.
\v 5 Yirmeyahu commanded Barukh, saying, "I am restricted. I cannot go into the house of יהוה.
\v 6 Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, the words of יהוה, in the ears of the people in the house of יהוה on the fast day. Also you shall read them in the ears of all Yehudah who come out of their cities.
\v 7 It may be they will present their petition before יהוה, and will each return from his evil way; for יהוה has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people."
\p
\v 8 Barukh the son of Neriyah did according to all that Yirmeyahu the prophet commanded him, reading in the book of the words of יהוה in the house of יהוה.
\v 9 Now in the fifth year of Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah, in the ninth new moon, all the people in Yerushalayim, and all the people who came from the cities of Yehudah to Yerushalayim, proclaimed a fast before יהוה.
\v 10 Then Barukh read the words of Yirmeyahu from the book in the house of יהוה, in the room of Gemaryahu the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of the house of יהוה, in the ears of all the people.
\p
\v 11 When Mikhayahu the son of Gemaryahu, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of יהוה,
\v 12 he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's room: and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delayahu the son of Shemayahu, Elnathan the son of Akbor, Gemaryahu the son of Shaphan, Tsidqiyahu the son of Ḥananyahu, and all the princes.
\v 13 Then Mikhayahu declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Barukh read the book in the ears of the people.
\v 14 Therefore all the princes sent Yehudi the son of Nethanyahu, the son of Shelemyahu, the son of Kushi, to Barukh, saying, "Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come." So Barukh the son of Neriyahu took the scroll in his hand, and came to them.
\v 15 They said to him, "Sit down now, and read it in our hearing." So Barukh read it in their hearing.
\p
\v 16 Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Barukh, "We will surely tell the king of all these words."
\v 17 They asked Barukh, saying, "Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?"
\p
\v 18 Then Barukh answered them, "He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book."
\p
\v 19 Then the princes said to Barukh, "You and Yirmeyahu go hide. Do not let anyone know where you are."
\p
\v 20 They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king.
\v 21 So the king sent Yehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Yehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king.
\v 22 Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth new moon; and there was a fire in the hearth burning before him.
\v 23 When Yehudi had read three or four leaves, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the hearth, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the hearth.
\v 24 The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and did not tear their garments.
\v 25 Moreover Elnathan and Delayahu and Gemaryahu had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them.
\v 26 The king commanded Yeraḥme'el the king's son, and Serayahu the son of Azri'el, and Shelemyahu the son of Avde'el, to arrest Barukh the scribe and Yirmeyahu the prophet; but יהוה hid them.
\p
\v 27 Then the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Barukh wrote at the mouth of Yirmeyahu, saying,
\v 28 "Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Yehoyaqim the king of Yehudah has burned.
\v 29 Concerning Yehoyaqim king of Yehudah you shall say, 'יהוה says: "You have burned this scroll, saying, "Why have you written therein, saying, 'The king of Bavel will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and animal?'"'
\v 30 Therefore יהוה says concerning Yehoyaqim king of Yehudah: "He will have no one to sit on David's throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
\v 31 I will punish him, his seed, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and on the men of Yehudah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they did not listen."'"
\p
\v 32 Then took Yirmeyahu another scroll, and gave it to Barukh the scribe, the son of Neriyahu, who wrote therein from the mouth of Yirmeyahu all the words of the book which Yehoyaqim king of Yehudah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.
\c 37
\p
\v 1 Tsidqiyahu the son of Yoshiyahu reigned as king, instead of Konyah the son of Yehoyaqim, whom Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel made king in the land of Yehudah.
\v 2 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to the words of יהוה, which He spoke by the prophet Yirmeyahu.
\p
\v 3 Tsidqiyahu the king sent Yehukal the son of Shelemyah, and Tsephanyahu the son of Ma'aseiyah, the priest, to the prophet Yirmeyahu, saying, "Pray now to יהוה our Elohim for us."
\p
\v 4 Now Yirmeyahu came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.
\v 5 Pharaoh's army had come out of Mitsrayim; and when the Kaldeans who were besieging Yerushalayim heard news of them, they broke up from Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 6 Then the word of יהוה came to the prophet Yirmeyahu, saying,
\v 7 "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says, 'You shall tell the king of Yehudah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: "Behold, Pharaoh's army, which has come out to help you, will return to Mitsrayim into their own land.
\v 8 The Kaldeans will come again, and fight against this city. They will take it and burn it with fire."'
\p
\v 9 "יהוה says, 'Do not deceive yourselves, saying, "The Kaldeans will surely depart from us;" for they will not depart.
\v 10 For though you had struck the whole army of the Kaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yes they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.'"
\p
\v 11 When the army of the Kaldeans had broken up from Yerushalayim for fear of Pharaoh's army,
\v 12 then Yirmeyahu went out of Yerushalayim to go into the land of Benyamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle of the people.
\v 13 When he was in Benyamin's gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Yiriyah, the son of Shelemyah, the son of Ḥananyah; and he seized Yirmeyahu the prophet, saying, "You are defecting to the Kaldeans!"
\p
\v 14 Then Yirmeyahu said, "That is false! I am not defecting to the Kaldeans." But he did not listen to him; so Yiriyah seized Yirmeyahu, and brought him to the princes.
\v 15 The princes were angry with Yirmeyahu, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Yehonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.
\v 16 When Yirmeyahu had come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Yirmeyahu had remained there many days,
\v 17 then Tsidqiyahu the king sent, and had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, "Is there any word from יהוה?" Yirmeyahu said, "There is." He also said, "You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Bavel."
\p
\v 18 Moreover Yirmeyahu said to King Tsidqiyahu, "How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?
\v 19 Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Bavel will not come against you, nor against this land?'
\v 20 Now please hear, my master the king: please let my petition be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Yehonathan the scribe, lest I die there."
\p
\v 21 Then Tsidqiyahu the king commanded, and they committed Yirmeyahu into the court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Yirmeyahu remained in the court of the guard.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 Shephatyah the son of Mattan, and Gedalyahu the son of Pashḥur, and Yukal the son of Shelemyahu, and Pashḥur the son of Malkiyahu, heard the words that Yirmeyahu spoke to all the people, saying,
\v 2 "יהוה says, 'He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out to the Kaldeans will live, and his being will be to him a spoil, and he will live.'
\v 3 יהוה says, 'This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Bavel, and he will take it.'"
\p
\v 4 Then the princes said to the king, "Please let this man be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but harm."
\p
\v 5 Tsidqiyahu the king said, "Behold, he is in your hand; for the king cannot do anything to oppose you."
\p
\v 6 Then they took Yirmeyahu and threw him into the dungeon of Malkiyahu the king's son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Yirmeyahu with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Yirmeyahu sank in the mire.
\p
\v 7 Now when Evedmelekh the Kushite, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Yirmeyahu in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benyamin's gate),
\v 8 Evedmelekh went out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,
\v 9 "My master the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Yirmeyahu the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city."
\p
\v 10 Then the king commanded Evedmelekh the Kushite, saying, "Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Yirmeyahu the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies."
\p
\v 11 So Evedmelekh took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Yirmeyahu.
\v 12 Evedmelekh the Kushite said to Yirmeyahu, "Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords." Yirmeyahu did so.
\v 13 So they drew up Yirmeyahu with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Yirmeyahu remained in the court of the guard.
\p
\v 14 Then Tsidqiyahu the king sent and took Yirmeyahu the prophet to himself into the third entry that is in the house of יהוה. Then the king said to Yirmeyahu, "I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me."
\p
\v 15 Then Yirmeyahu said to Tsidqiyah, "If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me."
\p
\v 16 So Tsidqiyahu the king swore secretly to Yirmeyahu, saying, "As יהוה lives, who made us this being, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your being."
\p
\v 17 Then Yirmeyahu said to Tsidqiyahu, "יהוה, Elohim Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'If you will go out to the king of Bavel's princes, then your being will live, and this city will not be burned with fire. You will live, along with your house.
\v 18 But if you will not go out to the king of Bavel's princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the Kaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape out of their hand.'"
\p
\v 19 Tsidqiyahu the king said to Yirmeyahu, "I am afraid of the Yehudim who have defected to the Kaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me."
\p
\v 20 But Yirmeyahu said, "They will not deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the voice of יהוה, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and your being will live.
\v 21 But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that יהוה has shown me:
\v 22 'Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Yehudah's house will be brought out to the king of Bavel's princes, and those women will say, "Your familiar friends have turned on you, and have prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire, they have turned away from you."
\p
\v 23 They will bring out all your wives and your children to the Kaldeans. You will not escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Bavel. You will cause this city to be burned with fire.'"
\p
\v 24 Then Tsidqiyahu said to Yirmeyahu, "Let no man know of these words, and you will not die.
\v 25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, 'Declare to us now what you have said to the king; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;'
\v 26 then you shall tell them, 'I presented my petition before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Yehonathan's house, to die there.'"
\p
\v 27 Then all the princes came to Yirmeyahu, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
\v 28 So Yirmeyahu stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Yerushalayim was taken.
\c 39
\p
\v 1 In the ninth year of Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah, in the tenth new moon, Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel and all his army came against Yerushalayim, and besieged it.
\v 2 In the eleventh year of Tsidqiyahu, in the fourth new moon, the ninth day of the new moon, a breach was made in the city.
\v 3 All the princes of the king of Bavel came in, and sat in the middle gate, Nergal-Saretser, Samga-rnebo, Sar-sekim, Rav-saris, Nergal-Saretser, Rav-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Bavel.
\v 4 When Tsidqiyahu the king of Yehudah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Aravah.
\p
\v 5 But the army of the Kaldeans pursued them, and overtook Tsidqiyahu in the plains of Yeriḥo. When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel to Rivlah in the land of Ḥamath; and he pronounced judgments on him.
\v 6 Then the king of Bavel killed Tsidqiyahu's sons in Rivlah before his eyes. The king of Bavel also killed all the nobles of Yehudah.
\v 7 Moreover he put out Tsidqiyahu's eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Bavel.
\p
\v 8 The Kaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Yerushalayim.
\v 9 Then Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Bavel the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the remnant of the people who remained.
\v 10 But Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Yehudah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
\p
\v 11 Now Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel commanded Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Yirmeyahu, saying,
\v 12 "Take him, and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you."
\p
\v 13 So Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, with Nevushazban, Rav-saris, and Nergal-Saretser, Rav-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Bavel;
\v 14 they sent, and took Yirmeyahu out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he lived among the people.
\p
\v 15 Now the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, while he was closed up in the court of the guard, saying,
\v 16 "Go, and speak to Evedmelekh the Kushite, saying, 'יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: "Behold, I will bring My words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you in that day.
\v 17 But I will deliver you in that day," says יהוה; "and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
\v 18 For I will surely save you, and you will not fall by the sword, but your life will be to you a spoil; because you have relied on Me," says יהוה.'"
\c 40
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, after Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Yerushalayim and Yehudah, who were carried away captive to Bavel.
\v 2 The captain of the guard took Yirmeyahu, and said to him, "יהוה your Elohim pronounced this evil on this place;
\v 3 and יהוה has brought it, and done according to what He spoke. Because you have sinned against יהוה, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you.
\v 4 Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good in your eyes to come with me into Bavel, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Bavel, do not. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, there go."
\v 5 Now while he had not yet gone back, "Go back then," he said, "to Gedalyah the son of Aḥiqam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Bavel has made governor over the cities of Yehudah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go." So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.
\v 6 Then Yirmeyahu went to Gedalyah the son of Aḥiqam to Mitspah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.
\p
\v 7 Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Bavel had made Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Bavel;
\v 8 then Yishma'el the son of Nethanyahu, and Yoḥanan and Yonathan the sons of Qareaḥ, and Serayah the son of Tanḥumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Yezanyahu the son of the Ma'akathite, they and their men came to Gedalyah to Mitspah.
\p
\v 9 "Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, "Do not be afraid to serve the Kaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Bavel, and it will be well with you.
\v 10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mitspah, to stand before the Kaldeans who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken."
\p
\v 11 Likewise when all the Yehudim who were in Moav, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Bavel had left a remnant of Yehudah, and that he had set over them Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam, the son of Shaphan;
\v 12 then all of Yehudah that has returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Yehudah, to Gedalyahu, to Mitspah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits.
\p
\v 13 Moreover Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedalyahu to Mitspah,
\v 14 and said to him, "Do you know that Ba'al is the king of the children of Ammon, and has sent Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah to strike your being?" But Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam did not trust them.
\p
\v 15 Then Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ spoke to Gedalyahu in Mitspah secretly, saying, "Please let me go, and I will kill Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your being, that all the Yehudim who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Yehudah perish?"
\p
\v 16 But Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam said to Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, "You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Yishma'el."
\c 41
\p
\v 1 Now in the seventh new moon, Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam to Mitspah; and there they ate bread together in Mitspah.
\v 2 Then Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, whom the king of Bavel had made governor over the land.
\v 3 Yishma'el also killed all the Yehudim who were with him, with Gedalyahu, at Mitspah, and the Kaldeans who were found there, the men of war.
\p
\v 4 The second day after he had killed Gedalyahu, and no man knew it,
\v 5 men came from Shekhem, from Shiloh, and from Shom'ron, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of יהוה.
\v 6 Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah went out from Mitspah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and as he met them, he said to them, "Come to Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam."
\p
\v 7 It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.
\v 8 But ten men were found among those who said to Yishma'el, "Do not kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey." So he stopped, and did not kill them among their brothers.
\v 9 Now the pit in which Yishma'el cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedalyahu (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Ba'asha king of Yisra'el), Yishma'el the son of Nethanyahu filled it with those who were killed.
\p
\v 10 Then Yishma'el carried away captive all the of the people who were left in Mitspah, even the king's daughters, and all the people who remained in Mitspah, whom Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam. Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 11 But when Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah had done,
\v 12 then they took all the men, and went to fight with Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah, and found him by the great waters that are in Givon.
\v 13 Now when all the people who were with Yishma'el saw Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.
\v 14 So all the people who Yishma'el had carried away captive from Mitspah turned about and came back, and went to Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ.
\v 15 But Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah escaped from Yoḥanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 16 Then Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah, from Mitspah, after he had killed Gedalyah the son of Aḥiqam, the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Givon.
\v 17 They departed and lived in Geruth Kimham, which is by Beth-leḥem, to go to enter into Mitsrayim
\v 18 because of the Kaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah had killed Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam, whom the king of Bavel made governor over the land.
\c 42
\p
\v 1 Then all the captains of the forces, and Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, and Yezanyah the son of Hoshayah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,
\v 2 and said to Yirmeyahu the prophet, "Please let our petition be presented before you, and pray for us to יהוה your Elohim, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes see us;
\v 3 that יהוה your Elohim may show us the way in which we should walk, and the things that we should do."
\p
\v 4 Then Yirmeyahu the prophet said to them, "I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to יהוה your Elohim according to your words; and it will happen that whatever thing יהוה answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you."
\p
\v 5 Then they said to Yirmeyahu, "May יהוה be a true and faithful witness among us, if we do not do according to all the word with which יהוה your Elohim sends you to tell us.
\v 6 Whether it is good, or whether it is bad, we will obey the voice of יהוה our Elohim, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of יהוה our Elohim."
\p
\v 7 After ten days, the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu.
\v 8 Then he called Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
\v 9 and said to them, "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him, says:
\v 10 'If you will still live in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you.
\v 11 Do not be afraid of the king of Bavel, of whom you are afraid. Do not be afraid of him,' says יהוה: 'for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
\v 12 I will grant you compassion, that he may have compassion on you, and cause you to return to your own land.
\p
\v 13 "'But if you say, "We will not dwell in this land;" so that you do not obey the voice of יהוה your Elohim,
\v 14 saying, "No; but we will go into the land of Mitsrayim, where we will see no war, nor hear the sound of the shofar, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:"'
\v 15 Now therefore hear the word of יהוה, O remnant of Yehudah: יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says, 'If you indeed set your faces to enter into Mitsrayim, and go to live there;
\v 16 then it will happen that the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Mitsrayim; and the famine, about which you are afraid, will follow close behind you there in Mitsrayim; and you will die there.
\v 17 So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Mitsrayim to live there. They will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. None of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.'
\v 18 For יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'As My anger and My wrath has been poured out on the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, so My wrath will be poured out on you, when you enter into Mitsrayim; and you will be an object of horror, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you will see this place no more.'
\p
\v 19 "יהוה has spoken concerning you, remnant of Yehudah, 'Do not go into Mitsrayim!' Know certainly that I have testified to you today.
\v 20 For you have dealt deceitfully against your own beings; for you sent me to יהוה your Elohim, saying, 'Pray for us to יהוה our Elohim; and according to all that יהוה our Elohim says, so declare to us, and we will do it:'
\v 21 and I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed the voice of יהוה your Elohim in anything for which He has sent me to you.
\v 22 Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live there."
\c 43
\p
\v 1 When Yirmeyahu had finished speaking to all the people all the words of יהוה their Elohim, with which יהוה their Elohim had sent him to them, even all these words,
\v 2 then Azaryah the son of Hoshayah, Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Yirmeyahu, "You speak falsely. יהוה our Elohim has not sent you to say, 'You shall not go into Mitsrayim to live there;'
\v 3 but Barukh the son of Neriyah has turned you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Kaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Bavel."
\p
\v 4 So Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of יהוה, to dwell in the land of Yehudah.
\v 5 But Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Yehudah, who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Yehudah;
\v 6 the men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters, and every person who Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam, the son of Shaphan; and Yirmeyahu the prophet, and Barukh the son of Neriyahu;
\v 7 and they came into the land of Mitsrayim; for they did not obey the voice of יהוה: and they came to Taḥpanḥes.
\p
\v 8 Then the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu in Taḥpanḥes, saying,
\v 9 "Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Taḥpanḥes, in the sight of the men of Yehudah;
\v 10 and tell them, יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'Behold, I will send and take Nevukhadnetsar the king of Bavel, My servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his royal pavilion over them.
\v 11 He will come, and will strike the land of Mitsrayim; such as are for death will be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.
\v 12 I will kindle a fire in the houses of the elohim of Mitsrayim. He will burn them, and carry them away captive. He will array himself with the land of Mitsrayim, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he will go out from there in peace.
\v 13 He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Mitsrayim; and he will burn the houses of the elohim of Mitsrayim with fire.'"
\c 44
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Yirmeyahu concerning all the Yehudim who lived in the land of Mitsrayim, who lived at Migdol, and at Taḥpanḥes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
\v 2 "יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Yerushalayim, and on all the cities of Yehudah. Behold, today they are a desolation, and no man dwells in them,
\v 3 because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other elohim that they did not know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.
\v 4 However I sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, "Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate."
\v 5 But they did not listen and did not incline their ear. They did not turn from their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other elohim.
\v 6 Therefore My wrath and My anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Yehudah and in the streets of Yerushalayim; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is today.'
\p
\v 7 "Therefore now יהוה, Elohim Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'Why do you commit great evil against your own beings, to cut off from yourselves man and woman, infant and nursing child out of the middle of Yehudah, to leave yourselves no one remaining;
\v 8 in that you provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other elohim in the land of Mitsrayim, where you have gone to live; that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
\v 9 Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Yehudah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Yehudah and in the streets of Yerushalayim?
\v 10 They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in My Torah, nor in My statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.'
\p
\v 11 "Therefore יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: 'Behold, I will set My face against you for evil, even to cut off all Yehudah.
\v 12 I will take the remnant of Yehudah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Mitsrayim to live there, and they will all be consumed. They will fall in the land of Mitsrayim. They will be consumed by the sword and by the famine. They will die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine. They will be an object of horror, an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
\v 13 For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Mitsrayim, as I have punished Yerushalayim, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;
\v 14 so that none of the remnant of Yehudah, who have gone into the land of Mitsrayim to live there, will escape or be left to return into the land of Yehudah, to which their being wants to return to dwell there; for no one will return except those who will escape.'"
\p
\v 15 Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other elohim, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of Mitsrayim, in Pathros, answered Yirmeyahu, saying,
\v 16 "As for the word that you have spoken to us in the Name of יהוה, we will not listen to you.
\v 17 But we will certainly perform every word that has gone out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Yehudah, and in the streets of Yerushalayim; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.
\v 18 But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of the heavens, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
\p
\v 19 "When we burned incense to the queen of the heavens, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes for her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?"
\p
\v 20 Then Yirmeyahu said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying,
\v 21 "The incense that you burned in the cities of Yehudah, and in the streets of Yerushalayim, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not יהוה remember them, and did it not come into His heart?
\v 22 Thus יהוה could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is today.
\v 23 Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against יהוה, and have not obeyed the voice of יהוה, nor walked in His Torah, nor in His statutes, nor in His witnesses; therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is today."
\p
\v 24 Moreover Yirmeyahu said to all the people, including all the women, "Hear the word of יהוה, all Yehudah who are in the land of Mitsrayim!
\v 25 יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says, 'You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, "We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink offerings to her." "'Establish then your vows, and perform your vows.'
\p
\v 26 "Therefore hear the word of יהוה, all Yehudah who dwell in the land of Mitsrayim: 'Behold, I have sworn by My great Name,' says יהוה, 'that My Name will no more be named in the mouth of any man of Yehudah in all the land of Mitsrayim, saying, "As Adonai יהוה lives."
\v 27 Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Yehudah who are in the land of Mitsrayim will be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until they are all gone.
\v 28 Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Mitsrayim into the land of Yehudah few in number. All the remnant of Yehudah, who have gone into the land of Mitsrayim to live there, will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs.
\p
\v 29 "'This will be the sign to you,' says יהוה, 'that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for evil.'
\v 30 יהוה says, 'Behold, I will give Pharaoh Ḥophra king of Mitsrayim into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his being; as I gave Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah into the hand of Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel, who was his enemy, and sought his being.'"
\c 45
\p
\v 1 The message that Yirmeyahu the prophet spoke to Barukh the son of Neriyah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Yirmeyahu, in the fourth year of Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah, saying,
\v 2 "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says to you, Barukh:
\v 3 'You said, "Woe is me now! For יהוה has added sorrow to my pain! I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest."'
\p
\v 4 "You shall tell him, יהוה says: 'Behold, that which I have built, I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.
\v 5 Do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh,' says יהוה; 'but I will let your being be to you a spoil wherever you go.'"
\c 46
\p
\v 1 The word of יהוה which came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning the nations.
\p
\v 2 Of Mitsrayim: concerning the army of Pharaoh Nekhoh king of Mitsrayim, which was by the Perath River in Karkemish, which Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel struck in the fourth year of Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Yehudah.
\p
\v 3 "Prepare the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle!
\v 4 Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen, and stand up with your helmets. Polish the spears, put on the coats of mail.
\v 5 Why have I seen it? They are dismayed and are turned backward. Their mighty ones are beaten down, have fled in haste, and do not look back. Terror is on every side," says יהוה.
\p
\v 6 "Do not let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape. In the north by the Perath River they have stumbled and fallen.
\v 7 Who is this who rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?
\v 8 Mitsrayim rises up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers. He says, 'I will rise up. I will cover the earth. I will destroy cities and its inhabitants.'
\p
\v 9 Go up, you horses! Rage, you chariots! Let the mighty men go out: Kush and Put, who handle the shield; and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.
\v 10 For that day is of Adonai יהוה Tsevaot, a day of vengeance, that He may avenge Himself of His adversaries. The sword will devour and be satiated, and will drink its fill of their blood; for Adonai יהוה Tsevaot has a sacrifice in the north country by the Perath River.
\p
\v 11 Go up into Gilad, and take balm, virgin daughter of Mitsrayim. You use many medicines in vain. There is no healing for you.
\v 12 The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, they both fall together."
\p
\v 13 The word that יהוה spoke to Yirmeyahu the prophet, how that Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel should come and strike the land of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 14 "Declare in Mitsrayim, publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Taḥpanḥes: say, 'Stand up, and prepare; for the sword has devoured around you.'
\v 15 Why are your strong ones swept away? They did not stand, because יהוה pushed them.
\v 16 He made many to stumble. Yes, they fell on one another. They said, 'Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword.'
\v 17 They cried there, 'Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim is but a noise; he has let the appointed time pass by.'
\v 18 "As I live," says the King, whose Name is יהוה Tsevaot, "surely like Tavor among the mountains, and like Karmel by the sea, so he will come.
\v 19 You, daughter, who dwells in Mitsrayim, furnish yourself to go into captivity; for Noph will become a desolation, and will be burned up, without inhabitant.
\p
\v 20 "Mitsrayim is a very beautiful heifer; but destruction out of the north has come. It has come.
\v 21 Also her hired men in the middle of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back. They have fled away together. They did not stand, for the day of their calamity has come on them, the time of their visitation.
\v 22 Its voice will go like the naḥash; for they will march with an army, and come against her with axes, as wood cutters.
\v 23 They will cut down her forest," says יהוה, "though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.
\v 24 The daughter of Mitsrayim will be disappointed; she will be delivered into the hand of the people of the north."
\p
\v 25 יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: "Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Mitsrayim, with her elohim, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and those who rely on him.
\v 26 I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their beings, and into the hand of Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel, and into the hand of his servants. Afterwards it will be inhabited, as in the days of old," says יהוה.
\p
\v 27 "But do not you be afraid, Ya'aqov My servant. Do not be dismayed, Yisra'el; for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity. Ya'aqov will return, and will be quiet and at ease. No one will make him afraid.
\v 28 Do not be afraid, O Ya'aqov My servant," says יהוה; "for I am with you; for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you; but I will not make a full end of you, but I will discipline you in judgment, and will in no way leave you unpunished."
\c 47
\p
\v 1 The word of יהוה that came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza.
\p
\v 2 יהוה says: "Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and will become an overflowing wadi, and will overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and those who dwell therein. The men will cry, and all the inhabitants of the land will wail.
\v 3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers do not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;
\v 4 because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tsor and Tsidon every helper who remains; for יהוה will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Kaphtor.
\v 5 Baldness has come on Gaza; Ashqelon is brought to nothing, the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?
\p
\v 6 "'You sword of יהוה, how long will it be before you are quiet? Put yourself back into your scabbard; rest, and be still.'
\v 7 How can you be quiet, since יהוה has given you a command? Against Ashqelon, and against the seashore, there has He appointed it."
\c 48
\p
\v 1 Of Moav. יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: "Woe to Nevo! For it is laid waste. Qiryathayim is disappointed. It is taken. The stronghold is put to shame and broken down.
\v 2 The praise of Moav is no more. In Ḥeshbon they have devised evil against her: 'Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation.' You also, Madmen, will be brought to silence. The sword will pursue you.
\v 3 The sound of a cry from Ḥoronayim, desolation and great destruction!
\v 4 Moav is destroyed. Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
\v 5 For they will go up by the ascent of Luḥith with continual weeping. For at the descent of Ḥoronayim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.
\v 6 Flee! Save your beings! Be like the juniper bush in the wilderness.
\v 7 For because you have relied on your works and on your treasures, you also will be taken. Kemosh will go out into captivity, his priests and his princes together.
\v 8 The destroyer will come on every city, and no city will escape; the valley also will perish, and the plain will be destroyed; as יהוה has spoken.
\v 9 Give wings to Moav that she may fly and get herself away: and her cities will become a desolation, without anyone to dwell in them.
\p
\v 10 "Cursed is he who does the work of יהוה negligently; and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.
\p
\v 11 "Moav has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed.
\p
\v 12 Therefore behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that I will send to him those who pour off, and they will pour him off; and they will empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.
\v 13 Moav will be ashamed of Kemosh, as the house of Yisra'el was ashamed of Beth-El, their confidence.
\v 14 "How do you say, 'We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?'
\v 15 Moav is laid waste, and they have gone up into his cities, and his chosen young men have gone down to slaughter," says the King, whose Name is יהוה Tsevaot.
\v 16 "The calamity of Moav is near to come, and his affliction hurries fast.
\v 17 All you who are around him, pity him, and all you who know his name; say, 'How the strong staff is broken, the beautiful rod!'
\p
\v 18 "You, daughter, who dwells in Divon, come down from your glory, and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of Moav has come up against you. He has destroyed your strongholds.
\p
\v 19 Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch. Ask him who flees, and her who escapes; say, 'What has been done?'
\v 20 Moav is disappointed; for it is broken down. Wail and cry! Tell it by the Arnon, that Moav is laid waste.
\v 21 Judgment has come on the plain country, on Ḥolon, on Yahtsah, on Mepha'ath,
\v 22 on Divon, on Nevo, on Beth Divlathayim,
\v 23 on Qiryathayim, on Beth Gamul, on Beth Meon,
\v 24 on Qerioth, on Botsrah, and on all the cities of the land of Moav, far or near.
\v 25 The horn of Moav is cut off, and his arm is broken," says יהוה.
\v 26 "Make him drunken; for he magnified himself against יהוה. Moav will wallow in his vomit, and he also will be in derision.
\v 27 For was Yisra'el not a derision to you? Was he found among thieves? For as often as you speak of him, you shake your head.
\v 28 You inhabitants of Moav, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock. Be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.
\p
\v 29 "We have heard of the pride of Moav. He is very proud in his loftiness, his pride, his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.
\v 30 I know his wrath," says יהוה, "that it is nothing; his boastings have done nothing.
\v 31 Therefore I will wail for Moav. Yes, I will cry out for all Moav. They will mourn for the men of Qir Ḥeres.
\p
\v 32 With more than the weeping of Yazer will I weep for you, vine of Sivmah. Your branches passed over the sea. They reached even to the sea of Yazer. The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruits and on your vintage.
\v 33 Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moav. I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses. No one will tread with shouting. The shouting will be no shouting.
\v 34 From the cry of Ḥeshbon even to Elealeh, even to Yahats have they uttered their voice, from Tsoar even to Ḥoronayim, to Eglath Shelishiyah; for the waters of Nimrim will also become desolate.
\v 35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moav," says יהוה, "him who offers in the high place, and him who burns incense to his elohim.
\v 36 Therefore My heart sounds for Moav like pipes, and My heart sounds like pipes for the men of Qir Ḥeres. Therefore the abundance that he has gotten has perished.
\p
\v 37 For every head is bald, and every beard clipped. There are cuttings on all the hands, and sackcloth on the loins.
\v 38 On all the housetops of Moav, and in its streets, there is lamentation everywhere; for I have broken Moav like a vessel in which no one delights," says יהוה.
\p
\v 39 "How it is broken down! How they wail! How Moav has turned the back with shame! So will Moav become a derision and a terror to all who are around him."
\p
\v 40 For יהוה says: "Behold, he will fly as an eagle, and will spread out his wings against Moav.
\v 41 Qerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized. The heart of the mighty men of Moav at that day will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\v 42 Moav will be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against יהוה.
\v 43 Terror, the pit, and the snare are on you, inhabitant of Moav," says יהוה.
\p
\v 44 "He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit; and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken in the snare: for I will bring on him, even on Moav, the year of their visitation," says יהוה.
\p
\v 45 "Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Ḥeshbon; for a fire has gone out of Ḥeshbon, and a flame from the middle of Siḥon, and has devoured the corner of Moav, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
\v 46 Woe to you, O Moav! The people of Kemosh are undone; for your sons are taken away captive, and your daughters into captivity.
\v 47 "Yet I will reverse the captivity of Moav in the latter days," says יהוה. Thus far is the judgment of Moav.
\c 49
\p
\v 1 Of the children of Ammon. יהוה says: "Has Yisra'el no sons? Has he no heir? Why then does Malkam possess Gad, and his people dwell in its cities?"
\p
\v 2 "Therefore behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it will become a desolate heap, and her daughters will be burned with fire: then Yisra'el will possess those who possessed him," says יהוה.
\p
\v 3 "Wail, Ḥeshbon, for Ai is laid waste! Cry, you daughters of Rabbah! Clothe yourself in sackcloth. Lament, and run back and forth among the fences; for Malkam will go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.
\v 4 Why do you boast in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding daughter? You relied on her treasures, saying, 'Who will come to me?'
\v 5 Behold, I will bring a terror on you," says Adonai יהוה Tsevaot, "from all who are around you. All of you will be driven completely out, and there will be no one to gather together the fugitives.
\v 6 "But afterward I will reverse the captivity of the children of Ammon," says יהוה.
\p
\v 7 Of Edom, יהוה Tsevaot says: "Is wisdom no more in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?
\v 8 Flee! Turn back! Dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esaw on him when I visit him.
\v 9 If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves came by night, would not they steal until they had enough?
\v 10 But I have made Esaw bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he will not be able to hide himself. His seed is destroyed, with his brothers and his neighbors; and he is no more.
\v 11 Leave your fatherless children. I will preserve them alive. Let your widows trust in Me."
\p
\v 12 For יהוה says: "Behold, those who were not judged to drink of the cup will certainly drink; and are you he who will altogether go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but you will surely drink.
\v 13 For I have sworn by Myself," says יהוה, "that Botsrah will become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse. All its cities will be perpetual wastes."
\p
\v 14 I have heard news from יהוה, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, "Gather yourselves together! Come against her! Rise up to the battle!"
\p
\v 15 "For, behold, I have made you small among the nations, and despised among men.
\v 16 As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill, though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there," says יהוה.
\p
\v 17 "Edom will become an astonishment. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished, and will hiss at all its plagues.
\v 18 As in the overthrow of Sedom and Gomorrah and its neighbor cities," says יהוה, "no man will dwell there, neither will any son of man live therein.
\p
\v 19 "Behold, he will come up like a lion from the pride of the Yarden against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, I will appoint him over it. For who is like Me? Who will appoint Me a time? Who is the shepherd who will stand before Me?"
\p
\v 20 Therefore hear the counsel of יהוה that He has taken against Edom; and His purposes, that He has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they will drag them away, the little ones of the flock. Surely He will make their habitation desolate over them.
\v 21 The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise which is heard in the Sea of Reeds.
\v 22 Behold, He will come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out His wings against Botsrah. The heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\p
\v 23 Of Dammeseq: "Ḥamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil news. They have melted away. There is sorrow on the sea. It cannot be quiet.
\v 24 Dammeseq has grown feeble, she turns herself to flee, and trembling has seized her. Anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.
\v 25 How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of My joy?
\v 26 Therefore her young men will fall in her streets, and all the men of war will be brought to silence in that day," says יהוה Tsevaot.
\p
\v 27 "I will kindle a fire in the wall of Dammeseq, and it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad."
\p
\v 28 Of Qedar, and of the kingdoms of Ḥatsor, which Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel struck. יהוה says: "Arise, go up to Qedar, and destroy the children of the east.
\v 29 They will take their tents and their flocks. They will carry away for themselves their curtains, all their vessels, and their camels; and they will cry to them, 'Terror on every side!'
\v 30 Flee! Wander far off! Dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Ḥatsor," says יהוה; "for Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.
\v 31 Arise! Go up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells securely," says יהוה; "that has neither gates nor bars, that dwells alone.
\v 32 Their camels will be plunder, and the multitude of their livestock a spoil. I will scatter to all winds those who are cast off to the corners; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them," says יהוה.
\p
\v 33 "Ḥatsor will be a dwelling place of monsters, a desolation forever. No man will dwell there, neither will any son of man live therein."
\p
\v 34 The word of יהוה that came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Tsidqiyahu king of Yehudah, saying,
\v 35 "יהוה Tsevaot says: 'Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
\v 36 I will bring on Elam the four winds from the four quarters of the heavens, and will scatter them toward all those winds. There will be no nation where the outcasts of Elam will not come.
\v 37 I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those who seek their being. I will bring evil on them, even My fierce anger,' says יהוה; 'and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.
\v 38 I will set My throne in Elam, and will destroy from there king and princes,' says יהוה.
\p
\v 39 'But it will happen in the latter days that I will reverse the captivity of Elam,' says יהוה."
\c 50
\p
\v 1 The word that יהוה spoke concerning Bavel, concerning the land of the Kaldeans, by Yirmeyahu the prophet.
\p
\v 2 "Declare among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and do not conceal say, 'Bavel has been taken, Bel is disappointed, Merodak is dismayed! Her images are disappointed. Her idols are dismayed.'
\v 3 For a nation comes up out of the north against her, which will make her land desolate, and no one will dwell in it. They have fled. They are gone, both man and animal."
\p
\v 4 "In those days, and in that time," says יהוה, "the children of Yisra'el will come, they and the children of Yehudah together; they will go on their way weeping, and will seek יהוה their Elohim.
\v 5 They will inquire concerning Tsion with their faces turned toward it, saying, 'Come, and join yourselves to יהוה in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.'
\v 6 My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds have caused them to go astray. They have turned them away on the mountains. They have gone from mountain to hill. They have forgotten their resting place.
\v 7 All who found them have devoured them. Their adversaries said, 'We are not guilty, because they have sinned against יהוה, the habitation of righteousness, even יהוה, the hope of their fathers.'
\p
\v 8 "Flee out of the middle of Bavel! Go out of the land of the Kaldeans, and be as the male goats before the flocks.
\v 9 For, behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Bavel a company of great nations from the north country; and they will set themselves in array against her. She will be taken from there. Their arrows will be as of an expert mighty man. None of them will return in vain.
\v 10 Kaldea will be a spoil. All who despoil her will be satisfied," says יהוה.
\p
\v 11 "Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you who plunder my heritage, because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain, and neigh as strong horses;
\v 12 your mother will be utterly disappointed. She who bore you will be confounded. Behold, she will be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\v 13 Because of the wrath of יהוה she will not be inhabited, but she will be wholly desolate. Everyone who goes by Bavel will be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
\v 14 Set yourselves in array against Bavel all around, all you who bend the bow; shoot at her. Spare no arrows; for she has sinned against יהוה.
\v 15 Shout against her all around. She has submitted herself. Her ramparts have fallen. Her walls have been thrown down, for it is the vengeance of יהוה. Take vengeance on her. As she has done, do to her.
\v 16 Cut off the sower from Bavel, and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest. For fear of the oppressing sword, they will each return to their own people, and they will each flee to their own land.
\p
\v 17 "Yisra'el is a hunted sheep. The lions have driven him away. First, the king of Ashuwr devoured him, and now at last Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel has broken his bones."
\p
\v 18 Therefore יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says: "Behold, I will punish the king of Bavel and his land, as I have punished the king of Ashuwr.
\v 19 I will bring Yisra'el again to his pasture, and he will feed on Karmel and Bashan. His being will be satisfied on the hills of Ephrayim and in Gilad.
\v 20 In those days, and in that time," says יהוה, "the iniquity of Yisra'el will be sought for, and there will be none; also the sins of Yehudah, and they will not be found; for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.
\p
\v 21 "Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Peqod. Kill and utterly destroy after them," says יהוה, "and do according to all that I have commanded you.
\v 22 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
\v 23 How the hammer of the whole earth is cut apart and broken! How Bavel has become a desolation among the nations!
\v 24 I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, Bavel, and you were not aware. You are found, and also caught, because you have fought against יהוה.
\v 25 יהוה has opened His armory, and has brought out the weapons of His indignation; for Adonai יהוה Tsevaot has a work to do in the land of the Kaldeans.
\v 26 Come against her from the farthest border. Open her storehouses. Cast her up as heaps. Destroy her utterly. Let nothing of her be left.
\v 27 Kill all her bulls. Let them go down to the slaying. Woe to them! For their day has come, the time of their visitation.
\v 28 Listen to those who flee and escape out of the land of Bavel, to declare in Tsion the vengeance of יהוה our Elohim, the vengeance of His Temple.
\p
\v 29 "Call together the archers against Bavel, all those who bend the bow. Encamp against her all around. Let none of it escape. Pay her back according to her work. According to all that she has done, do to her; for she has been proud against יהוה, against the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\v 30 Therefore her young men will fall in her streets. All her men of war will be brought to silence in that day," says יהוה.
\p
\v 31 "Behold, I am against you, you proud one," says Adonai יהוה Tsevaot; "for your day has come, the time that I will visit you.
\v 32 The proud one will stumble and fall, and no one will raise him up. I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it will devour all who are around him."
\p
\v 33 יהוה Tsevaot says: "The children of Yisra'el and the children of Yehudah are oppressed together. All who took them captive hold them fast. They refuse to let them go.
\v 34 Their Redeemer is strong: יהוה Tsevaot is His Name. He will thoroughly plead their cause, that He may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Bavel.
\p
\v 35 "A sword is on the Kaldeans," says יהוה, "and on the inhabitants of Bavel, on her princes, and on her wise men.
\v 36 A sword is on the boasters, and they will become fools. A sword is on her mighty men, and they will be dismayed.
\v 37 A sword is on their horses, on their chariots, and on all the mixed people who are in the middle of her; and they will become as women. A sword is on her treasures, and they will be plundered.
\v 38 A drought is on her waters, and they will be dried up; for it is a land of engraved images, and they are mad over idols.
\v 39 Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves will dwell there. The ostriches will dwell therein; and it will be inhabited no more forever; neither will it be lived in from generation to generation.
\v 40 As when Elohim overthrew Sedom and Gomorrah and its neighbor cities," says יהוה, "so no man will dwell there, neither will any son of man live therein.
\p
\v 41 "Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation and many kings will be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
\v 42 They take up bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no compassion. Their voice roars like the sea. They ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Bavel.
\v 43 The king of Bavel has heard the news of them, and his hands become feeble: anguish has taken hold of him, pains as of a woman in labor.
\v 44 Behold, the enemy will come up like a lion from the pride of the Yarden against the strong habitation; for I will suddenly make them run away from it. Whoever is chosen, I will appoint him over it; for who is like Me? Who will appoint Me a time? Who is the shepherd who can stand before Me?"
\p
\v 45 Therefore hear the counsel of יהוה that He has taken against Bavel; and His purposes, that He has purposed against the land of the Kaldeans: Surely they will drag them away, even the little ones of the flock. Surely He will make their habitation desolate over them.
\v 46 At the noise of the taking of Bavel the earth trembles; and the cry is heard among the nations.
\c 51
\p
\v 1 יהוה says: "Behold, I will raise up against Bavel, and against those who dwell in the heart of those who rise up, a destroying wind.
\v 2 I will send to Bavel strangers, who will winnow her. They will empty her land; for in the day of trouble they will be against her all around.
\v 3 Against him who bends, let the archer bend his bow, also against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail. Do not spare her young men! Utterly destroy all her army!
\v 4 They will fall down slain in the land of the Kaldeans, and thrust through in her streets.
\v 5 For Yisra'el is not forsaken, nor Yehudah, by his Elohim, by יהוה Tsevaot; though their land is full of guilt against the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 6 "Flee out of the middle of Bavel! Everyone save his own being! Do not be cut off in her iniquity; for it is the time of the vengeance of יהוה. He will render to her a recompense.
\v 7 Bavel has been a golden cup in the hand of יהוה, who made all the earth drunk. The nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations have gone mad.
\v 8 Bavel has suddenly fallen and been destroyed! Wail for her! Take balm for her pain. Perhaps she may be healed.
\p
\v 9 "We would have healed Bavel, but she is not healed. Forsake her, and let us each go into his own country; for her judgment reaches to the heavens, and is lifted up even to the skies.
\v 10 'יהוה has produced our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Tsion the work of יהוה our Elohim.'
\p
\v 11 "Make the arrows sharp! Hold the shields firmly! יהוה has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because His purpose is against Bavel, to destroy it; for it is the vengeance of יהוה, the vengeance of His Temple.
\v 12 Set up a standard against the walls of Bavel! Make the watch strong! Set the watchmen, and prepare the ambushes; for יהוה has both purposed and done that which He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Bavel.
\v 13 You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your covetousness.
\p
\v 14 יהוה Tsevaot has sworn by His being, saying, 'Surely I will fill you with men, as with the canker worm; and they will lift up a shout against you.'
\p
\v 15 "He has made the earth by His power. He has established the world by His wisdom. By His understanding He has stretched out the heavens.
\v 16 When He utters His voice, there is a roar of waters in the heavens, and He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, and brings the wind out of His treasuries.
\p
\v 17 "Every man has become brutish without knowledge. Every goldsmith is disappointed by his image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\v 18 They are vanity, a work of delusion. In the time of their visitation, they will perish.
\v 19 The portion of Ya'aqov is not like these, for He is the former of all things; including the tribe of His inheritance: יהוה Tsevaot is His Name.
\p
\v 20 "You are My battle ax and weapons of war. With you I will break the nations into pieces. With you I will destroy kingdoms.
\v 21 With you I will break in pieces the horse and his rider.
\v 22 With you I will break in pieces the chariot and him who rides therein. With you I will break in pieces man and woman. With you I will break in pieces the old man and the youth. With you I will break in pieces the young man and the virgin.
\v 23 With you I will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock. With you I will break in pieces the farmer and his yoke. With you will I break in pieces governors and deputies.
\p
\v 24 "I will render to Bavel and to all the inhabitants of Kaldea all their evil that they have done in Tsion in your eyes," says יהוה.
\p
\v 25 "Behold, I am against you, destroying mountain," says יהוה, "which destroys all the earth. I will stretch out My hand on you, roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burned mountain.
\v 26 They will not take a cornerstone from you, nor a stone for foundations; but you will be desolate forever," says יהוה.
\p
\v 27 "Set up a standard in the land! Blow a shofar among the nations! Prepare the nations against her! Call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz! Appoint a marshal against her! Cause the horses to come up as the rough canker worm!
\v 28 Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes, its governors, and all its deputies, and all the land of their dominion!
\v 29 The land trembles and is in pain; for the purposes of יהוה against Bavel stand, to make the land of Bavel a desolation, without inhabitant.
\v 30 The mighty men of Bavel have stopped fighting, they remain in their strongholds. Their might has failed. They have become as women. Her dwelling places are set on fire. Her bars are broken.
\v 31 One runner will run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Bavel that his city is taken on every quarter.
\v 32 So the passages are seized. They have burned the reeds with fire. The men of war are frightened."
\p
\v 33 For יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el says: "The daughter of Bavel is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden. Yet a little while, and the time of harvest comes for her."
\p
\v 34 "Nevukhadnetsar the king of Bavel has devoured me. He has crushed me. He has made me an empty vessel. He has, like a monster, swallowed me up. He has filled his mouth with my delicacies. He has cast me out.
\v 35 May the violence done to me and to my flesh be on Bavel!" the inhabitant of Tsion will say; and, "May my blood be on the inhabitants of Kaldea!" will Yerushalayim say.
\p
\v 36 Therefore יהוה says: "Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you. I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry.
\v 37 Bavel will become heaps, a dwelling place for monsters, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.
\v 38 They will roar together like young lions. They will growl as lions' cubs.
\v 39 When they are heated, I will make their banquet, and I will make them drunk, that they may rejoice and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake up," says יהוה.
\p
\v 40 "I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats.
\v 41 How Sheshak is taken! How the praise of the whole earth seized! How Bavel has become a desolation among the nations!
\v 42 The sea has come up on Bavel. She is covered with the multitude of its waves.
\v 43 Her cities have become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land in which no man dwells. No son of man passes by it.
\v 44 I will execute judgment on Bel in Bavel, and I will bring out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up. The nations will not flow any more to him. Yes, the wall of Bavel will fall.
\p
\v 45 "My people, go away from the middle of her, and each of you save yourselves from the fierce anger of יהוה.
\v 46 Do not let your heart faint. Do not fear for the news that will be heard in the land. For news will come one year, and after that in another year news will come, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
\v 47 Therefore behold, the days come that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Bavel; and her whole land will be confounded. All her slain will fall in the middle of her.
\v 48 Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, will sing for joy over Bavel; for the destroyers will come to her from the north," says יהוה.
\p
\v 49 "As Bavel has caused the slain of Yisra'el to fall, so the slain of all the land will fall at Bavel.
\v 50 You who have escaped the sword, go! Do not stand still! Remember יהוה from afar, and let Yerushalayim come into your mind."
\p
\v 51 "We are confounded, because we have heard reproach. Confusion has covered our faces, for strangers have come into the set-apart places of the house of יהוה."
\p
\v 52 "Therefore behold, the days come," says יהוה, "that I will execute judgment on her engraved images; and through all her land the wounded will groan.
\v 53 Though Bavel should mount up to the heavens, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet destroyers will come to her from Me," says יהוה.
\p
\v 54 "The sound of a cry comes from Bavel, and of great destruction from the land of the Kaldeans!
\v 55 For יהוה lays Bavel waste, and destroys out of her the great voice! Their waves roar like many waters. The noise of their voice is uttered.
\v 56 For the destroyer has come on her, even on Bavel. Her mighty men are taken. Their bows are broken in pieces, for יהוה is an El of retribution. He will surely repay.
\v 57 I will make her princes, her wise men, her governors, her deputies, and her mighty men drunk. They will sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake up," says the King, whose Name is יהוה Tsevaot.
\p
\v 58 יהוה Tsevaot says: "The wide walls of Bavel will be utterly overthrown. Her high gates will be burned with fire. The peoples will labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they will be weary."
\p
\v 59 The word which Yirmeyahu the prophet commanded Serayah the son of Neriyah, the son of Maḥseiyah, when he went with Tsidqiyahu the king of Yehudah to Bavel in the fourth year of his reign. Now Serayah was chief quartermaster.
\v 60 Yirmeyahu wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Bavel, even all these words that are written concerning Bavel.
\v 61 Yirmeyahu said to Serayah, "When you come to Bavel, then see that you read all these words,
\v 62 and say, 'יהוה, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that no one will dwell in it, neither man nor animal, but that it will be desolate forever.'
\v 63 It will be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of the Perath.
\v 64 Then you shall say, 'Thus will Bavel sink, and will not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; and they will be weary.'" Thus far are the words of Yirmeyahu.
\c 52
\p
\v 1 Tsidqiyahu was twenty-one years old when he began to reign. He reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Ḥamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu of Livnah.
\v 2 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, according to all that Yehoyaqim had done.
\v 3 For through the anger of יהוה this happened in Yerushalayim and Yehudah, until He had cast them out from His presence. Tsidqiyahu rebelled against the king of Bavel.
\v 4 In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth new moon, in the tenth day of the new moon, Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel came, he and all his army, against Yerushalayim, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.
\v 5 So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of King Tsidqiyahu.
\p
\v 6 In the fourth new moon, in the ninth day of the new moon, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\v 7 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden. Now the Kaldeans were against the city all around. The men of war went toward the Aravah,
\v 8 but the army of the Kaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Tsidqiyahu in the plains of Yeriḥo; and all his army was scattered from him.
\v 9 Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Bavel to Rivlah in the land of Ḥamath; and he pronounced judgments on him.
\v 10 The king of Bavel killed the sons of Tsidqiyahu before his eyes. He also killed all the princes of Yehudah in Rivlah.
\v 11 He put out the eyes of Tsidqiyahu; and the king of Bavel bound him in fetters, and carried him to Bavel, and put him in prison until the day of his death.
\p
\v 12 Now in the fifth new moon, in the tenth day of the new moon, which was the nineteenth year of King Nevukhadnetsar, king of Bavel, Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Bavel, came into Yerushalayim.
\v 13 He burned the house of יהוה, and the king's house; and all the houses of Yerushalayim, even every great house, he burned with fire.
\v 14 All the army of the Kaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Yerushalayim all around.
\v 15 Then Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Bavel, and the residue of the multitude.
\v 16 But Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.
\p
\v 17 The Kaldeans broke the pillars of copper that were in the house of יהוה, and the bases and the copper sea that were in the house of יהוה in pieces, and carried all of their copper to Bavel.
\v 18 They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of copper with which they ministered.
\v 19 The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the menorot, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.
\p

\v 33 and changed his prison garments. Yehoyakin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.
\v 34 For his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Bavel, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
