\s1 Introduction
\p
\v 1 The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that ישוע began both to do and to teach,
\v 2 until the day in which He was received up, after He had given command through the Set-apart Ruaḥ to the sheliḥim whom He had chosen.
\v 3 To these He also showed Himself alive after He suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about the Kingdom of Elohim.
\v 4 Being assembled together with them, He commanded them, "Do not depart from Yerushalayim, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from Me.
\v 5 For Yoḥanan indeed immersed in water, but you will be immersed in the Set-apart Ruaḥ not many days from now."
\p
\v 6 Therefore when they had come together, they asked Him, "Master, are You now restoring the kingdom to Yisra'el?"
\p
\v 7 He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within His own authority.
\v 8 But you will receive power when the Set-apart Ruaḥ has come upon you. You will be My witnesses in Yerushalayim, in all Yehudah and Shom'ron, and to the uttermost parts of the earth."
\s1 The Ascension
\p
\v 9 When He had said these things, as they were looking, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.
\v 10 While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as He went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing,
\v 11 who also said, "You men of the Galil, why do you stand looking into the sky? This ישוע, who was received up from you into the sky, will come back in the same way as you saw Him going into the sky."
\s1 Upper Room; Mattithyahu Replaces Yehudah
\p
\v 12 Then they returned to Yerushalayim from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Yerushalayim, a Sabbath day's journey away.
\v 13 When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Kepha, Yoḥanan, Ya'aqov, Andreas, Philippos, Taom, Bar-Talmai, Mattithyahu, Ya'aqov the son of Ḥeleph, Shimon the Kena'anite, and Yehudah the son of Ya'aqov.
\v 14 All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer, along with the women, and Miryam the mother of ישוע, and with His brothers.
\p
\v 15 In these days, Kepha stood up in the middle of the brothers (and the crowd of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,
\v 16 "Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Set-apart Ruaḥ spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Yehudah, who was guide to those who took ישוע.
\v 17 For he was counted with us, and received his portion in this service.
\v 18 Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed out.
\v 19 It became known to everyone who lived in Yerushalayim that in their language that field was called 'Ḥeqal-dama,' that is, 'The field of blood.'
\v 20 For it is written in the book of Tehillim, 'Let his habitation be made a wilderness. Let no one dwell therein;' and, 'Let another take his office.'
\p
\v 21 "Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Master ישוע went in and out among us,
\v 22 beginning from the immersion of Yoḥanan, to the day that He was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of His resurrection."
\p
\v 23 They put forward two, Yoseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Ioustus, and Mattithyahu.
\v 24 They prayed, and said, "You, יהוה, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two You have chosen
\v 25 to take part in this service and work of the sheliḥim from which Yehudah fell away, that he might go to his own place."
\v 26 They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Mattithyahu, and he was counted with the eleven sheliḥim.
\c 2
\s1 Day of Pentecost [Shavuot]
\p
\v 1 Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.
\v 2 Suddenly there came from the heavens a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
\v 3 Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them.
\v 4 They were all filled with the Set-apart Ruaḥ, and began to speak other languages, as the Ruaḥ gave them the ability to speak.
\v 5 Now there were dwelling in Yerushalayim Yehudim, devout men, from every nation under the heavens.
\v 6 When this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language.
\v 7 They were all amazed and marveled, saying, "Behold, are all these who speak not Galileans?
\v 8 How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?
\v 9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Aram-Naharayim, Yehudah, Kappadokia, Pontus, Asia,
\v 10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Mitsrayim, the parts of Luvim around Kurene, visitors from Rome, [both Yehudim and proselytes,]
\v 11 Cretans and Aravians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of Elohim!"
\v 12 They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
\v 13 Others, mocking, said, "They are filled with new wine."
\s1 Kepha's Speech
\p
\v 14 But Kepha, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, "You men of Yehudah, and all you who dwell at Yerushalayim, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.
\v 15 For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day.
\v 16 But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Yo'el:
\v 17 'It will be in the last days, says Elohim, that I will pour out My Ruaḥ on all flesh. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions. Your old men will dream dreams.
\v 18 Yes, and on My bondservants and on My handmaidens in those days, I will pour out My Ruaḥ, and they will prophesy.
\v 19 I will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.
\v 20 The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of יהוה comes.
\v 21 It will be that whoever will call on the Name of יהוה will be saved.'
\p
\v 22 "Men of Yisra'el, hear these words! ישוע of Nazareth, a man approved by Elohim to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which Elohim did by Him among you, even as you yourselves know,
\v 23 Him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of Elohim, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, nailed up and killed;
\v 24 whom Elohim raised up, having loosed the agony of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it.
\v 25 For David says concerning Him, 'I saw יהוה always before my face, for He is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
\v 26 Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;
\v 27 because You will not leave my being in Sheol, neither will You allow Your Set-apart One to see decay.
\v 28 You made known to me the ways of life. You will make me full of gladness with Your presence.'
\p
\v 29 "Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
\v 30 Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that Elohim had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, [according to the flesh, to raise up the Messiah] to sit on his throne,
\v 31 he foresaw that this spoke about the resurrection of the Messiah, that He was not left in Sheol, and His flesh did not see decay.
\v 32 This ישוע Elohim raised up, to which we all are witnesses.
\v 33 The right hand of Elohim being exalted therefore, and having received from the Father the promise of the Set-apart Ruaḥ, He has poured out this, which you see and hear.
\v 34 For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself, 'יהוה said to my Master, "Sit at My right hand,
\v 35 until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."'
\p
\v 36 "Let all the house of Yisra'el therefore know certainly that Elohim has made Him both Master and Messiah, this ישוע whom you crucified."
\s1 The Fellowship of Believers
\p
\v 37 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Kepha and the rest of the sheliḥim, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
\p
\v 38 Kepha said to them, "Repent, and be immersed, every one of you, in the Name of ישוע Messiah for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Set-apart Ruaḥ.
\v 39 For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as יהוה our Elohim will call to Himself."
\v 40 With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"
\p
\v 41 Then those who received his word were immersed. There were added that day about three thousand beings.
\v 42 They continued steadfastly in the teaching of the sheliḥim and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and the prayers.
\v 43 Fear came on every being, and many wonders and signs were done through the sheliḥim.
\v 44 All who believed were together, and had all things in common.
\v 45 They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.
\v 46 Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
\v 47 praising Elohim, and having favor with all the people. יהוה added to their number day by day those who are being saved.
\c 3
\s1 Healing the Lame Beggar
\p
\v 1 Kepha and Yoḥanan were going up into the Temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
\v 2 A certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the Temple which is called 'Beautiful,' to ask for gifts for the needy of those who entered into the Temple.
\v 3 Seeing Kepha and Yoḥanan about to go into the Temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy.
\v 4 Kepha, fastening his eyes on him, with Yoḥanan, said, "Look at us."
\v 5 He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.
\v 6 But Kepha said, "I have no silver or gold, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of ישוע Messiah of Nazareth, get up and walk!"
\v 7 He took him by the right hand, and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.
\v 8 Leaping up, he stood, and began to walk. He entered with them into the Temple, walking, leaping, and praising Elohim.
\v 9 All the people saw him walking and praising Elohim.
\v 10 They recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
\v 11 As he held on to Kepha and Yoḥanan, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Shelomoh's, greatly wondering.
\s1 Kepha Addresses the People
\p
\v 12 When Kepha saw it, he responded to the people, "You men of Yisra'el, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk?
\v 13 The Elohim of Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya'aqov, the Elohim of our fathers, has glorified His Servant ישוע, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release Him.
\v 14 But you denied the Set-apart and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
\v 15 and killed the Prince of life, whom Elohim raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.
\v 16 By faith in His Name, His Name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which is through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
\p
\v 17 "Now, brothers, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
\v 18 But the things which Elohim announced by the mouth of all His prophets, that Messiah should suffer, He thus fulfilled.
\p
\v 19 "Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of יהוה,
\v 20 and that He may send Messiah ישוע, who was appointed for you before,
\v 21 whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which Elohim spoke from the age by the mouth of His set-apart prophets.
\v 22 For Mosheh indeed said to the fathers, 'יהוה Elohim will raise up a Prophet for you from among your brothers, like me. You shall listen to Him in all things whatever He says to you.
\v 23 It will be that every being that will not listen to that Prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'
\v 24 Yes, and all the prophets from Shemu'el and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.
\v 25 You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which Elohim cut with our fathers, saying to Avraham, 'In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.'
\v 26 Elohim, having raised up His servant, sent Him to you first to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your wickedness."
\c 4
\s1 Kepha and Yoḥanan Arrested
\p
\v 1 As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the Temple and the Sadducees came to them,
\v 2 being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in ישוע the resurrection from the dead.
\v 3 They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.
\v 4 But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
\p
\v 5 In the morning, their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Yerushalayim.
\v 6 Ḥananyah the high priest was there, with Qayapha, Yoḥanan, Alexandros, and as many as were relatives of the high priest.
\v 7 When they had stood Kepha and Yoḥanan in the middle of them, they inquired, "By what power, or in what Name, have you done this?"
\p
\v 8 Then Kepha, filled with the Set-apart Ruaḥ, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders,
\v 9 if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been saved,
\v 10 let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Yisra'el, that in the Name of ישוע Messiah of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom Elohim raised from the dead, in Him does this man stand here before you whole.
\v 11 He is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.'
\v 12 There is salvation in none other, for neither is there any other Name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved!"
\p
\v 13 Now when they saw the boldness of Kepha and Yoḥanan, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with ישוע.
\v 14 Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
\v 15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,
\v 16 saying, "What shall we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Yerushalayim, and we cannot deny it.
\v 17 But so that this spreads no further among the people, let us warn them, that from now on they do not speak to anyone in this Name."
\v 18 They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the Name of ישוע.
\p
\v 19 But Kepha and Yoḥanan answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of Elohim to listen to you rather than to Elohim, judge for yourselves,
\v 20 for we cannot help telling the things which we saw and heard."
\p
\v 21 When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified Elohim for that which was done.
\v 22 For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
\s1 Prayer for Boldness
\p
\v 23 Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
\v 24 When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to Elohim with one accord, and said, "O יהוה, it is You who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
\v 25 who through the Set-apart Ruaḥ by the mouth of Your servant, David, said, 'Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
\v 26 The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take council together, against יהוה, and against His Messiah.'
\p
\v 27 "For truly, in this city against Your set-apart servant, ישוע, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations and the people of Yisra'el, were gathered together
\v 28 to do whatever Your hand and Your council foreordained to happen.
\v 29 Now, יהוה, look at their threats, and grant to Your bondservants to speak Your word with all boldness,
\v 30 while You stretch out Your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the Name of Your set-apart Servant ישוע."
\s1 Possessions Held in Common
\p
\v 31 When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Set-apart Ruaḥ, and they spoke the word of Elohim with boldness.
\v 32 The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and being. Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.
\v 33 With great power, the sheliḥim gave their witness of the resurrection of the Master ישוע. Great favor was on them all.
\v 34 For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,
\v 35 and laid them at the feet of the sheliḥim, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need.
\v 36 Yoseph, who by the sheliḥim was also called Barnava (which is, being translated, 'Son of Encouragement'), a Levite, a man of the Kuprite people,
\v 37 having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the sheliḥim.
\c 5
\s1 Ḥananyah and Sapphir
\p
\v 1 But a certain man named Ḥananyah, with Sapphir, his wife, sold a possession,
\v 2 and kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the feet of the sheliḥim.
\v 3 But Kepha said, "Ḥananyah, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Set-apart Ruaḥ, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
\v 4 While you kept it, did it not remain your own? After it was sold, was it not in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to Elohim."
\p
\v 5 Ḥananyah, hearing these words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard.
\v 6 The young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.
\v 7 About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.
\v 8 Kepha answered her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much." She said, "Yes, for so much."
\p
\v 9 But Kepha asked her, "How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Ruaḥ of יהוה? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
\p
\v 10 She fell down immediately at his feet, and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.
\v 11 Great fear came on the whole assembly, and on all who heard these things.
\p
\v 12 By the hands of the sheliḥim many signs and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one accord in Shelomoh's porch.
\v 13 None of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them.
\v 14 More of those believing were added to יהוה, multitudes of both men and women.
\v 15 They even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as Kepha came by, at the least his shadow might come over some of them.
\v 16 The multitude also came together from the cities around Yerushalayim, bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed.
\s1 Imprisonment and Release
\p
\v 17 But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,
\v 18 and laid hands on the sheliḥim, and put them in public custody.
\v 19 But a messenger of יהוה opened the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,
\v 20 "Go stand and speak in the Temple to the people all the words of this life."
\p
\v 21 When they heard this, they entered into the Temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the Sanhedrin together, and all the assembly of elders of the children of Yisra'el, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
\v 22 But the officers who came did not find them in the prison. They returned and reported,
\v 23 "We found the prison shut and locked, and the guards stood before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!"
\p
\v 24 Now when the captain of the Temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.
\v 25 One came and told them, "Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the Temple, standing and teaching the people."
\v 26 Then the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them.
\p
\v 27 When they had brought them, they set them before the Sanhedrin. The high priest questioned them,
\v 28 saying, "Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this Name? Behold, you have filled Yerushalayim with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us."
\p
\v 29 But Kepha and the sheliḥim answered, "We must obey Elohim rather than men.
\v 30 The Elohim of our fathers raised up ישוע, whom you killed, hanging Him on a tree.
\v 31 Elohim exalted Him, His right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Yisra'el, and remission of sins.
\v 32 We are witnesses of these things; and so also is the Set-apart Ruaḥ, whom Elohim has given to those who obey Him."
\s1 Gamali'el's Counsel
\p
\v 33 But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and were wanting to kill them.
\v 34 But one stood up in the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamali'el, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the men out for a little while.
\v 35 He said to them, "You men of Yisra'el, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do.
\v 36 For before these days Theudas rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.
\v 37 After this man, Yehudah of the Galil rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him. He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.
\v 38 Now I tell you, withdraw from these men, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown.
\v 39 But if it is of Elohim, you will not be able to overthrow them, and you would even be found to be fighting against Elohim!"
\p
\v 40 They agreed with him. Summoning the sheliḥim, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the Name of ישוע, and let them go.
\v 41 They therefore departed from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the His Name.
\p
\v 42 Every day, in the Temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming ישוע the Messiah.
\c 6
\s1 Seven Chosen to Serve
\p
\v 1 Now in those days, when the number of the talmidim was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.
\v 2 The twelve summoned the multitude of the talmidim and said, "It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of Elohim and serve tables.
\v 3 Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Ruaḥ [of יהוה] and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
\v 4 But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."
\p
\v 5 These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephanos, a man full of faith and of the Set-apart Ruaḥ, Philippos, Proḥorus, Nikanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nikolaos, a proselyte of Antioch;
\v 6 whom they set before the sheliḥim. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
\v 7 The word of Elohim increased and the crowd of the talmidim multiplied in Yerushalayim exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
\s1 Stephanos' Dispute
\p
\v 8 Stephanos, full of favor and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.
\v 9 But some of those who were of the synagogue called "The Freedmen", and of the Kurenes, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Kilikia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephanos.
\v 10 They were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Ruaḥ by which he spoke.
\v 11 Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Mosheh and Elohim."
\v 12 They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the Sanhedrin,
\v 13 and set up false witnesses who said, "This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this set-apart place and the law.
\v 14 For we have heard him say that this ישוע of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Mosheh delivered to us."
\v 15 All who sat in the Sanhedrin, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of a messenger.
\c 7
\s1 Stephanos' Speech
\p
\v 1 The high priest said, "Are these things so?"
\v 2 He said, "Brothers and fathers, listen. The Elohim of glory appeared to our father Avraham, when he was in Aram-Naharayim, before he lived in Ḥaran,
\v 3 and said to him, 'Get out of your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.'
\v 4 Then he came out of the land of the Kaldeans, and lived in Ḥaran. From there, when his father was dead, Elohim moved him into this land, where you are now living.
\v 5 He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that He would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no child.
\v 6 Elohim spoke in this way: that his seed would live as sojourners in a foreign land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
\v 7 'I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,' said Elohim, 'and after that will they come out, and serve Me in this place.'
\v 8 He gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Avraham brought forth Yitsḥaq, and circumcised him the eighth day. Yitsḥaq brought forth Ya'aqov, and Ya'aqov brought forth the twelve patriarchs.
\p
\v 9 "The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Yoseph, sold him into Mitsrayim. Elohim was with him,
\v 10 and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Mitsrayim. He made him governor over Mitsrayim and all his house.
\v 11 Now a famine came over all of Mitsrayim and Kena'an, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.
\v 12 But when Ya'aqov heard that there was grain in Mitsrayim, he sent out our fathers the first time.
\v 13 On the second time Yoseph was made known to his brothers, and Yoseph's race was revealed to Pharaoh.
\v 14 Yoseph sent, and summoned Ya'aqov, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five beings.
\v 15 Ya'aqov went down into Mitsrayim, and he died, himself and our fathers,
\v 16 and they were brought back to Shekhem, and laid in the tomb that Avraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Ḥamor in Shekhem.
\p
\v 17 "But as the time of the promise came close which Elohim had sworn to Avraham, the people grew and multiplied in Mitsrayim,
\v 18 until 'there arose a different king, who did not know Yoseph.'
\v 19 The same took advantage of our people, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they would not stay alive.
\v 20 At that time Mosheh was born, and was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three new moons in his father's house.
\v 21 When he was thrown out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son.
\v 22 Mosheh was instructed in all the wisdom of the Mitsrites. He was mighty in his words and works.
\v 23 But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Yisra'el.
\v 24 Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Mitsrite.
\v 25 He supposed that his brothers understood that Elohim, by his hand, was giving them deliverance; but they did not understand.
\p
\v 26 "The day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, 'Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?'
\v 27 But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Mitsrite yesterday?'
\v 29 Mosheh fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he brought forth two sons.
\p
\v 30 "When forty years were fulfilled, a messenger [of יהוה] appeared in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
\v 31 When Mosheh saw it, he wondered at the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of יהוה came to him,
\v 32 'I am the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Avraham, the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya'aqov.' Mosheh trembled, and dared not look.
\v 33 יהוה said to him, 'Take off your sandals, for the place where you stand is set-apart ground.
\v 34 I have surely seen the affliction of My people that is in Mitsrayim, and have heard their groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into Mitsrayim.'
\p
\v 35 "This Mosheh, whom they refused, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'—Elohim has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the messenger who appeared to him in the bush.
\v 36 This man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Mitsrayim, in the Sea of Reeds, and in the wilderness for forty years.
\v 37 This is that Mosheh, who said to the children of Yisra'el, 'יהוה our Elohim will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me.'
\v 38 This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the messenger that spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received living words to give to us,
\v 39 to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but rejected him, and turned back in their hearts to Mitsrayim,
\v 40 saying to Aharon, 'Make us elohim that will go before us, for as for this Mosheh, who led us out of the land of Mitsrayim, we do not know what has become of him.'
\v 41 They made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
\v 42 But Elohim turned, and gave them up to serve the army of the heavens, as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'Did you offer to Me slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Yisra'el?
\v 43 You took up the tabernacle of Moloḥ, the star of your el Rephan, the figures which you made to bow down to. I will carry you away beyond Bavel.'
\p
\v 44 "Our fathers had the Tabernacle of the Witness in the wilderness, even as He who spoke to Mosheh commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen;
\v 45 which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Yehoshua when they entered into the possession of the nations, whom Elohim drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David,
\v 46 who found favor in the sight of Elohim, and asked to find a habitation for the Elohim of Ya'aqov.
\v 47 But Shelomoh built Him a house.
\v 48 However, Elyon does not dwell in dwelling places made with hands, as the prophet says,
\v 49 'heaven is My throne, and the earth a footstool for My feet. What kind of house will you build Me?' says יהוה. 'Or what is the place of My rest?
\v 50 Did My hand not make all these things?'
\p
\v 51 "You stiff-necked and non-circumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Set-apart Ruaḥ! As your fathers did, so you do.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.
\v 53 You received the Torah as it was ordained by messengers, and did not guard it!"
\s1 The Stoning of Stephanos
\p
\v 54 Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth.
\v 55 But he, being full of the Set-apart Ruaḥ, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of Elohim, and ישוע standing from the right hand of Elohim,
\v 56 and said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing from the right hand of Elohim!"
\p
\v 57 But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at him with one accord.
\v 58 They threw him out of the city, and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Sha'ul.
\v 59 They stoned Stephanos as he called out, saying, "Master ישוע, receive my spirit!"
\v 60 He kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, "Master, do not hold this sin against them!" When he had said this, he fell asleep.
\c 8
\s1 Sha'ul Persecutes the Assembly
\p
\v 1 Sha'ul was consenting to his death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Yerushalayim in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Yehudah and Shom'ron, except for the sheliḥim.
\v 2 Devout men buried Stephanos, and lamented greatly over him.
\v 3 But Sha'ul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison.
\v 4 Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around proclaiming the word.
\v 5 Philippos went down to the city of Shom'ron, and proclaimed to them the Messiah.
\v 6 The crowds listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philippos, when they heard and saw the signs which he did.
\v 7 For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.
\v 8 There was great joy in that city.
\s1 Shimon the Sorcerer
\p
\v 9 But there was a certain man, Shimon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Shom'ron, making himself out to be some great one,
\v 10 to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the power of Elohim called 'Great.'"
\v 11 They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.
\v 12 But when they believed Philippos proclaiming good news concerning the Kingdom of Elohim and the Name of ישוע Messiah, they were immersed, both men and women.
\v 13 Shimon himself also believed. Being immersed, he continued with Philippos. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed.
\p
\v 14 Now when the sheliḥim who were at Yerushalayim heard that Shom'ron had received the word of Elohim, they sent Kepha and Yoḥanan to them,
\v 15 who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Set-apart Ruaḥ;
\v 16 for it had not yet fallen on them. They had only been immersed in the Name of the Master ישוע.
\v 17 Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Set-apart Ruaḥ.
\v 18 Now when Shimon saw that the Ruaḥ was given through the laying on of the hands of the sheliḥim, he offered them money,
\v 19 saying, "Give me also this power, that whomever I lay my hands on may receive the Set-apart Ruaḥ."
\v 20 But Kepha said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of Elohim with money!
\v 21 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before Elohim.
\v 22 Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask the Master if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.
\v 23 For I see that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."
\p
\v 24 Shimon answered, "Pray for me to יהוה, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me."
\p
\v 25 They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of יהוה, returned to Yerushalayim, and proclaimed the good news to many villages of the Shomeronites.
\v 26 But a messenger of יהוה spoke to Philippos, saying, "Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Yerushalayim to Gaza. This is a wilderness."
\s1 Philippos and the Kushite Eunuch
\p
\v 27 He arose and went; and behold, there was a man of Kush, a eunuch of great authority under Kandake, queen of the Kushites, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Yerushalayim to bow down.
\v 28 He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Yeshayahu.
\p
\v 29 The Ruaḥ said to Philippos, "Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."
\p
\v 30 Philippos ran to him, and heard him reading Yeshayahu the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
\p
\v 31 He said, "How can I, unless someone explains it to me?" He begged Philippos to come up and sit with him.
\v 32 Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter. As a lamb before his shearer is silent, so He does not open His mouth.
\v 33 In His humiliation, His judgment was taken away. Who will declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth."
\p
\v 34 The eunuch answered Philippos, "Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?"
\p
\v 35 Philippos opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, proclaimed to him about ישוע.
\v 36 As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being immersed?"
\p
\v 37 [Philippos said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." He answered, "I believe that ישוע Messiah is the Son of Elohim."]
\v 38 He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philippos and the eunuch, and he immersed him.
\p
\v 39 When they came up out of the water, the Ruaḥ of יהוה caught Philippos away, and the eunuch did not see him anymore, for he went on his way rejoicing.
\v 40 But Philippos was found at Ashdod. Passing through, he proclaimed the good news to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
\c 9
\s1 Sha'ul on the Road to Dammeseq
\p
\v 1 But Sha'ul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the talmidim of the Master, went to the high priest,
\v 2 and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Dammeseq, that if he found any who were of The Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Yerushalayim.
\v 3 As he traveled, he got close to Dammeseq, and suddenly a light from the heavens shone around him.
\v 4 He fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, "Sha'ul, Sha'ul, why do you persecute me?"
\p
\v 5 He said, "Who are You, Master?" The Master said, "I am ישוע, whom you are persecuting.
\v 6 But rise up, and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do."
\p
\v 7 The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one.
\v 8 Sha'ul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and brought him into Dammeseq.
\v 9 He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.
\p
\v 10 Now there was a certain talmid at Dammeseq named Ḥananyah. יהוה said to him in a vision, "Ḥananyah!" He said, "Behold, it is me, Master."
\p
\v 11 The Master said to him, "Arise, and go to the street which is called 'Straight,' and inquire in the house of Yehudah for one named Sha'ul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,
\v 12 and [in a vision] he saw a man named Ḥananyah coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight."
\p
\v 13 But Ḥananyah answered, "Master, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to Your set-apart ones at Yerushalayim.
\v 14 Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your Name."
\p
\v 15 But יהוה said to him, "Go your way, for he is My chosen vessel to bear My Name before the nations and kings, and the children of Yisra'el.
\v 16 For I will show him how many things he must suffer for My Name's sake."
\p
\v 17 Ḥananyah departed, and entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, "Brother Sha'ul, the Master, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Set-apart Ruaḥ."
\v 18 Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was immersed.
\v 19 He took food and was strengthened. [Sha'ul stayed several days with the talmidim who were at Dammeseq.]
\v 20 Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed ישוע, that He is the Son of Elohim.
\v 21 All who heard him were amazed, and said, "Is this not he who in Yerushalayim made havoc of those who called on this Name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!"
\s1 Sha'ul in Dammeseq and Yerushalayim
\p
\v 22 But Sha'ul increased more in strength, and confounded the Yehudim who lived at Dammeseq, proving that this is the Messiah.
\v 23 When many days were fulfilled, the Yehudim conspired together to kill him,
\v 24 but their plot became known to Sha'ul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,
\v 25 but his talmidim took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
\v 26 When Sha'ul had come to Yerushalayim, he tried to join himself to the talmidim; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a talmid.
\v 27 But Barnava took him, and brought him to the sheliḥim, and declared to them how יהוה had appeared to him on the way, and that He had spoken to him, and how at Dammeseq he had proclaimed boldly in the Name of ישוע.
\v 28 He was with them entering into Yerushalayim,
\v 29 proclaiming boldly in the Name of the Master. He spoke and disputed against the Hellenists, but they were seeking to kill him.
\v 30 When the brothers knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus.
\v 31 So the assembly throughout all Yehudah and the Galil and Shom'ron had peace, and was built up. It was multiplied, walking in the fear of יהוה and in the comfort of the Set-apart Ruaḥ.
\s1 Healing of Aineas
\p
\v 32 As Kepha went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the set-apart ones who lived at Lod.
\v 33 There he found a certain man named Aineas, who had been bedridden from eight years, because he was paralyzed.
\v 34 Kepha said to him, "Aineas, ישוע Messiah heals you. Get up and make your bed!" Immediately he arose.
\v 35 All who lived at Lod and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Master.
\s1 Raising of Dorkas
\p
\v 36 Now there was at Yapho a certain talmid named Tsebiyah, which when translated, is called Dorkas. This woman was full of good works and acts of kindness which she did.
\v 37 In those days, she became sick, and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.
\v 38 As Lod was near Yapho, the talmidim, hearing that Kepha was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, "Do not delay in coming to us."
\v 39 Kepha got up and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper room. All the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorkas had made while she was with them.
\v 40 Kepha sent them all out, and knelt down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, "Tsebiyah, get up!" She opened her eyes, and when she saw Kepha, she sat up.
\v 41 He gave her his hand, and raised her up. Calling the set-apart ones and widows, he presented her alive.
\v 42 And it became known throughout all Yapho, and many believed in the Master.
\v 43 He stayed many days in Yapho with a tanner named Shimon.
\c 10
\s1 Kepha and Cornelius
\p
\v 1 Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the cohort that is called Italian,
\v 2 a devout man, and one who feared Elohim with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to Elohim.
\v 3 At about the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision a messenger of Elohim coming to him, and saying to him, "Cornelius!"
\p
\v 4 He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, "What is it, Master?" He said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before Elohim.
\v 5 Now send men to Yapho, and get Shimon, who is also called Kepha.
\v 6 He lodges with a tanner named Shimon, whose house is by the sea.
\p
\v 7 When the messenger who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually.
\v 8 Having explained everything to them, he sent them to Yapho.
\s1 Kepha's Vision
\p
\v 9 Now on the next day as they were on their journey, and got close to the city, Kepha went up on the housetop to pray at about noon.
\v 10 He became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a state of astonishment.
\v 11 He saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,
\v 12 in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the heavens.
\v 13 A voice came to him, "Rise, Kepha, slaughter and eat!"
\p
\v 14 But Kepha said, "Not so, Master; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."
\p
\v 15 A voice came out to him again the second time, "What Elohim has cleansed, you must not call unclean."
\v 16 This was done three times, and immediately the container was received up into heaven.
\v 17 Now while Kepha was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Shimon's house, stood before the gate,
\v 18 and called and asked whether Shimon, who was also called Kepha, was lodging there.
\v 19 While Kepha was pondering the vision, the Ruaḥ said to him, "Behold, three men seek you.
\v 20 But arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them."
\p
\v 21 Kepha went down to the men, and said, "Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?"
\p
\v 22 They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears Elohim, and well-spoken of by all the nation of the Yehudim, was directed by a set-apart messenger to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say."
\v 23 So he called them in and provided a place to stay. On the next day he arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Yapho accompanied him.
\v 24 On the next day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends.
\v 25 When Kepha entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and bowed down before him.
\v 26 But Kepha raised him up, saying, "Stand up! I myself am also a man."
\v 27 As he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together.
\v 28 He said to them, "You yourselves know how it is unlawful for a man who is a Yehudite to join himself or come near a Gentile, but Elohim has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
\v 29 Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"
\p
\v 30 Cornelius said, "Four days ago, to this very hour, I was praying in my house in the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
\v 31 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of Elohim.
\v 32 Send therefore to Yapho, and summon Shimon, who is also called Kepha. He lodges in the house of a tanner named Shimon, by the sea.'
\v 33 Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of Elohim to hear all things that have been commanded you by Elohim."
\s1 Nations Hear the Good News
\p
\v 34 Kepha opened his mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that Elohim does not show favoritism;
\v 35 but in every nation he who fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him.
\v 36 The word which He sent to the children of Yisra'el, proclaiming good news of peace by ישוע Messiah—He is Master of all—
\v 37 you yourselves know what happened, which was proclaimed throughout all Yehudah, beginning from the Galil, after the immersion which Yoḥanan proclaimed;
\v 38 even ישוע of Nazareth, how Elohim anointed Him with the Set-apart Ruaḥ and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for Elohim was with Him.
\v 39 We are witnesses of everything He did both in the country of the Yehudim, and in Yerushalayim; whom they also killed, hanging Him on a tree.
\v 40 Elohim raised Him up the third day, and gave Him to be revealed,
\v 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by Elohim, to us, who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.
\v 42 He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that this is He who is appointed by Elohim as the Judge of the living and the dead.
\v 43 All the prophets testify about Him, that through His Name everyone who believes in Him will receive remission of sins."
\p
\v 44 While Kepha was still speaking these words, the Set-apart Ruaḥ fell on all those who heard the word.
\v 45 They of the circumcision who were believing were amazed, as many came with Kepha, because the gift of the Set-apart Ruaḥ was also poured out on the nations.
\v 46 For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying Elohim. Then Kepha answered,
\v 47 "Can anyone forbid these people from being immersed with water? They have received the Set-apart Ruaḥ just like us."
\v 48 He commanded them to be immersed in the Name of ישוע Messiah. Then they asked him to stay some days.
\c 11
\s1 Kepha Reports at Yerushalayim
\p
\v 1 Now the sheliḥim and the brothers who were in Yehudah heard that the nations had also received the word of Elohim.
\v 2 When Kepha had come up to Yerushalayim, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,
\v 3 saying, "You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!"
\p
\v 4 But Kepha began, and explained to them in order, saying,
\v 5 "I was in the city of Yapho praying, and in a state of astonishment I saw a vision: a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me.
\v 6 When I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the heavens.
\v 7 I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Kepha, slaughter and eat!'
\v 8 But I said, 'Not so, Master, for nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'
\v 9 But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, saying, 'What Elohim has cleansed, you do not call unclean.'
\v 10 This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.
\v 11 Behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.
\v 12 The Ruaḥ told me to go with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house.
\p
\v 13 "He told us how he had seen the messenger standing in his house, and saying to him, 'Send to Yapho, and get Shimon, who is called Kepha,
\v 14 who will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your house.'
\v 15 As I began to speak, the Set-apart Ruaḥ fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.
\v 16 I remembered the word of the Master, how He said, 'Yoḥanan indeed immersed in water, but you will be immersed in the Set-apart Ruaḥ.'
\v 17 If then Elohim gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Master ישוע Messiah, who was I, that I could withstand Elohim?"
\p
\v 18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified Elohim, saying, "Then Elohim has also granted to the nations repentance to life!"
\s1 The Assembly at Antioch
\p
\v 19 They therefore who were scattered abroad by the affliction that arose about Stephanos traveled as far as Phoenicia, Kupros, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Yehudim only.
\v 20 But there were some of them, men of Kupros and Kurene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, proclaiming the Master ישוע.
\p
\v 21 The hand of יהוה was with them, and a great number believed and turned to יהוה.
\v 22 The report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Yerushalayim. They sent out Barnava to go as far as Antioch,
\v 23 who, when he had come, and had seen the favor of Elohim, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain near to יהוה.
\v 24 For he was a good man, and full of the Set-apart Ruaḥ and of faith, and crowds were added to יהוה.
\p
\v 25 Barnava went out to Tarsus to look for Sha'ul.
\v 26 When he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they were gathered together with the assembly, and taught crowds. The talmidim were first called 'Christians' in Antioch.
\p
\v 27 Now in these days, prophets came down from Yerushalayim to Antioch.
\v 28 One of them named Ḥagav rose, and indicated by the Ruaḥ that there should be a great famine all over the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius.
\v 29 As any of the talmidim had plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Yehudah;
\v 30 which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnava and Sha'ul.
\c 12
\s1 Kepha's Arrest and Deliverance
\p
\v 1 Now about that time, King Herod stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly.
\v 2 He killed Ya'aqov, the brother of Yoḥanan, with the sword.
\v 3 When he saw that it pleased the Yehudim, he proceeded to seize Kepha also. This was during the Days of Unleavened Bread.
\v 4 When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Pesaḥ.
\v 5 Kepha therefore was guarded in the prison, but prayer was being made fervently by the assembly to Elohim for him.
\v 6 The same night when Herod was about to bring him out, Kepha was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.
\p
\v 7 And behold, a messenger of יהוה stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Kepha on the side, and woke him up, saying, "Stand up quickly!" His chains fell off from his hands.
\v 8 The messenger said to him, "Get dressed and put on your sandals." He did so. He said to him, "Put on your cloak, and follow me."
\v 9 And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the messenger was real, but thought he saw a vision.
\v 10 When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went out, and went down one street, and immediately the messenger departed from him.
\p
\v 11 When Kepha had come to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that יהוה has sent out His messenger and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the Yehudite people were expecting."
\v 12 Thinking about that, he came to the house of Miryam, the mother of Yoḥanan who was called Markos, where many were gathered together and were praying.
\v 13 When Kepha knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.
\v 14 When she recognized Kepha's voice, she did not open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that Kepha was standing in front of the gate.
\p
\v 15 They said to her, "You are crazy!" But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his messenger."
\v 16 But Kepha continued knocking. When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.
\v 17 But he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how יהוה had brought him out of the prison. He said, "Tell these things to Ya'aqov, and to the brothers." Then he departed, and went to another place.
\p
\v 18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Kepha.
\v 19 When Herod had sought for him, and did not find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Yehudah to Caesarea, and stayed there.
\s1 Death of Herod
\p
\v 20 Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tsor and Tsidon. They came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastos, the king's personal aide, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.
\v 21 On an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them.
\v 22 The people shouted, "The voice of an el, and not of a man!"
\v 23 Immediately a messenger of יהוה struck him, because he did not give Elohim the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.
\p
\v 24 But the word of Elohim grew and multiplied.
\v 25 Barnava and Sha'ul returned to Yerushalayim, when they had fulfilled their service, also taking with them Yoḥanan who was called Markos.
\c 13
\s1 Barnava and Sha'ul Sent Out
\p
\v 1 Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnava, Shimon who was called Niger, Lucius of Kurene, Menaḥem the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Sha'ul.
\v 2 As they served יהוה and fasted, the Set-apart Ruaḥ said, "Separate Barnava and Sha'ul for me, for the work to which I have called them."
\p
\v 3 Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
\v 4 So, being sent out by the Set-apart Ruaḥ, they went down to Seleukia. From there they sailed to Kupros.
\v 5 When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of Elohim in the Yehudite synagogues. They had also Yoḥanan as their attendant.
\v 6 When they had gone through the whole island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Yehudite, whose name was Bar-Yeshua,
\v 7 who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnava and Sha'ul, and sought to hear the word of Elohim.
\p
\v 8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so indeed is his name by translation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.
\v 9 But Sha'ul, also called Paulus, filled with the Set-apart Ruaḥ, fastened his eyes on him,
\v 10 and said, "Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of יהוה?
\v 11 Now, behold, the hand of יהוה is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!" Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
\v 12 Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of יהוה.
\p
\v 13 Now Sha'ul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. Yoḥanan departed from them and returned to Yerushalayim.
\v 14 But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.
\v 15 After the reading of the Torah and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak."
\p
\v 16 Sha'ul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, "Men of Yisra'el, and you who fear Elohim, listen.
\v 17 The Elohim of this people Yisra'el chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as sojourners in the land of Mitsrayim, and with an uplifted arm, He led them out of it.
\v 18 For about forty years He endured their ways in the wilderness.
\v 19 When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Kena'an, He gave them their land for an inheritance,
\v 20 for about four hundred fifty years. And after these things He gave them judges until Shemu'el the prophet.
\v 21 Afterward they asked for a king, and Elohim gave to them Sha'ul the son of Qish, a man of the tribe of Benyamin, for forty years.
\v 22 When He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, to whom He also testified, 'I have found David the son of Yishai, a man after My heart, who will do all My will.'
\p
\v 23 "From this man's seed Elohim has, according to His promise, raised up a savior to Yisra'el: ישוע,
\v 24 after Yoḥanan had first proclaimed the immersion of repentance to all the people of Yisra'el, before His coming;
\v 25 as Yoḥanan was fulfilling his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not He. But behold, one comes after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
\v 26 Men, brothers, children of the offspring of Avraham, and those among you who fear Elohim, the word of this salvation is sent out to us.
\p
\v 27 "For those who dwell in Yerushalayim, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning Him.
\v 28 Though they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate to have Him killed.
\v 29 When they had fulfilled all things that were written about Him, they took Him down from the tree, and laid Him in a tomb.
\v 30 But Elohim raised Him from the dead,
\v 31 and He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from the Galil to Yerushalayim, who are His witnesses to the people.
\v 32 We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,
\v 33 that Elohim has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that He raised up ישוע. As it is also written in the second psalm, 'You are My Son. Today I have brought You forth.'
\p
\v 34 "Concerning that He raised Him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, He has spoken thus: 'I will give you the set-apart and faithful blessings of David.'
\v 35 Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'You will not allow Your Set-apart One to see decay.'
\v 36 For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of Elohim, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw decay.
\v 37 But He whom Elohim raised up saw no decay.
\v 38 Be it known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,
\v 39 and by Him everyone who believes is declared right from all sins from which you were not able to be declared right by the Torah of Mosheh.
\v 40 Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:
\v 41 'Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which you will in no way believe, even if one declares it to you.'"
\p
\v 42 As they went out of the synagogue, they begged that these words might be proclaimed to them the next Sabbath.
\v 43 Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Yehudim and of the El-fearing proselytes followed Sha'ul and Barnava; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the favor of Elohim.
\v 44 The next Sabbath, almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of Elohim.
\v 45 But when the Yehudim saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Sha'ul, and blasphemed.
\s1 Sha'ul Turns to the Nations
\p
\v 46 Sha'ul and Barnava spoke out boldly, and said, "It was necessary that the word of Elohim should be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold, we turn to the nations.
\v 47 For so has יהוה commanded us, saying, 'I have set you as a light for the nations, that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"
\p
\v 48 As the nations heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of Elohim. As many as were appointed to everlasting life believed.
\v 49 The word of יהוה was spread abroad throughout all the region.
\v 50 But the Yehudim stirred up the El-fearing, prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Sha'ul and Barnava, and threw them out of their borders.
\v 51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconion.
\v 52 The talmidim were filled with joy and with the Set-apart Ruaḥ.
\c 14
\s1 Acceptance and Opposition
\p
\v 1 In Iconion, they entered together into the synagogue of the Yehudim, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Yehudim and of Greeks believed.
\v 2 But the disobedient Yehudim stirred up and embittered the beings of the nations against the brothers.
\v 3 Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in יהוה, who testified to the word of His favor, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
\v 4 But the multitude of the city was divided. Part sided with the Yehudim, and part with the sheliḥim.
\v 5 When some of both the nations and the Yehudim, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,
\v 6 they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lukaonia, Lustra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.
\v 7 There they proclaimed the good news.
\p
\v 8 At Lustra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.
\v 9 He was listening to Sha'ul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be saved,
\v 10 said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" He leaped up and walked.
\v 11 When the crowds saw what Sha'ul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, "The elohim have come down to us in the likeness of men!"
\v 12 They called Barnava "Zeus," and Sha'ul "Hermes", because he was the chief speaker.
\v 13 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a slaughtering along with the crowds.
\p
\v 14 But when the sheliḥim, Barnava and Sha'ul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the crowd, crying out,
\v 15 "Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living Elohim, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
\v 16 who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.
\v 17 Yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from the heavens and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."
\p
\v 18 Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the crowds from making a slaughtering to them.
\v 19 But some Yehudim from Antioch and Iconion came there, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Sha'ul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
\v 20 But as the talmidim stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnava to Derbe.
\v 21 When they had proclaimed the good news to that city, and had made many talmidim, they returned to Lustra, Iconion, and Antioch,
\v 22 confirming the beings of the talmidim, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of Elohim.
\p
\v 23 When they had appointed elders for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Master, in whom they had believed.
\v 24 They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.
\v 25 When they had spoken the word [of יהוה] in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
\v 26 From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the favor of Elohim for the work which they had fulfilled.
\v 27 When they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that Elohim had done with them, and that He had opened a door of faith to the nations.
\v 28 They stayed there with the talmidim for a long time.
\c 15
\s1 Yerushalayim Council
\p
\v 1 Certain men came down from Yehudah and taught the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Mosheh, you cannot be saved."
\v 2 Therefore when Sha'ul and Barnava had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Sha'ul and Barnava, and some others of them, to go up to Yerushalayim to the sheliḥim and elders about this question.
\v 3 They, being sent on their way by the assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Shom'ron, declaring the conversion of the nations. They caused great joy to all the brothers.
\v 4 When they had come to Yerushalayim, they were received by the assembly and the sheliḥim and the elders, and they reported all things that Elohim had done with them.
\p
\v 5 Moreover some of those of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to guard the Torah of Mosheh."
\p
\v 6 The sheliḥim and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.
\v 7 When there had been much discussion, Kepha rose up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that a good while ago Elohim made a choice among us, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the good news, and believe.
\v 8 Elohim, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Set-apart Ruaḥ, just like He did to us.
\v 9 He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
\v 10 Now therefore why do you tempt Elohim, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the talmidim which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\v 11 But by the favor of the Master ישוע, we believe to be saved in the same manner as them also."
\p
\v 12 All the multitude kept silence, and they listened to Barnava and Sha'ul reporting what signs and wonders Elohim had done among the nations through them.
\v 13 After they were silent, Ya'aqov answered, "Brothers, listen to me.
\v 14 Shimon has reported how Elohim first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for His Name.
\v 15 This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,
\v 16 'After these things I will return. I will again build the Tabernacle of David, which has fallen. I will again build its ruins. I will set it up,
\v 17 That the rest of men may seek after יהוה; all the nations who are called by My Name, says יהוה, who does all these things,
\v 18 known from the age.'
\p
\v 19 "Therefore my judgment is that we do not trouble those from among the nations who turn to Elohim,
\v 20 but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from whoring, from what is strangled, and from blood.
\v 21 For Mosheh from generations of old has in every city those who proclaim him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
\p
\v 22 Then it seemed good to the sheliḥim and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Sha'ul and Barnava: Yehudah called Barsabbas, and Shila, chief men among the brothers.
\v 23 They wrote these things by their hand: "The sheliḥim, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the nations in Antioch, Syria, and Kilikia: greetings.
\v 24 Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your beings;
\v 25 it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnava and Sha'ul,
\v 26 men who have risked their lives for the Name of our Master ישוע Messiah.
\v 27 We have sent therefore Yehudah and Shila, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.
\v 28 For it seemed good to the Ruaḥ, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things:
\v 29 that you abstain from things slaughtered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from whoring, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. Farewell."
\p
\v 30 So, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.
\v 31 When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.
\v 32 Yehudah and Shila, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and strengthened them.
\v 33 After they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the ones who sent them.
\v 34 [But it seemed good to Shila to remain.]
\v 35 But Sha'ul and Barnava stayed in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of יהוה, with many others also.
\p
\v 36 After some days Sha'ul said to Barnava, "Let us return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of יהוה, to see how they are doing."
\v 37 Barnava planned to take Yoḥanan, who was called Markos, with them also.
\v 38 But Sha'ul thought it better not to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and did not go with them to do the work.
\v 39 Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnava took Markos with him, and sailed away to Kupros,
\v 40 but Sha'ul chose Shila, and went out, being commended by the brothers to the favor of Elohim.
\v 41 He went through Syria and Kilikia, strengthening the assemblies.
\c 16
\s1 Timotheos Joins Sha'ul and Shila
\p
\v 1 He came to Derbe and Lustra: and behold, a certain talmid was there, named Timotheos, the son of a believing Yehudite woman; but his father was Greek.
\v 2 The brothers who were at Lustra and Iconion gave a good witness about him.
\v 3 Sha'ul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Yehudim who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was Greek.
\v 4 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to guard which had been ordained by the sheliḥim and elders who were at Yerushalayim.
\v 5 So the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
\p
\v 6 When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Set-apart Ruaḥ to speak the word in Asia.
\v 7 When they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Ruaḥ of ישוע did not allow them.
\v 8 Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
\v 9 A vision appeared to Sha'ul in the night. There was a male of Makedonia standing, begging him, and saying, "Come over into Makedonia and help us."
\v 10 When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Makedonia, concluding that our Master had called us to proclaim the good news to them.
\v 11 Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrake, and the day following to Neapolis;
\v 12 and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Makedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.
\p
\v 13 On the Sabbath day we went outside of the gate by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together.
\v 14 A certain woman named Ludia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who feared Elohim, heard us; whose heart our Master opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Sha'ul.
\v 15 When she and her household were immersed, she begged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to our Master, come into my house, and stay." So she persuaded us.
\s1 Sha'ul and Shila in Prison
\p
\v 16 As we were going to prayer, a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.
\v 17 Following Sha'ul and us, she cried out, "These men are bondservants of El Elyon, who proclaim to us a way of salvation!"
\v 18 She was doing this for many days. But Sha'ul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the Name of ישוע Messiah to come out of her!" It came out that very hour.
\v 19 But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Sha'ul and Shila, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
\v 20 When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men, being Yehudim, are agitating our city,
\v 21 and advocate customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans."
\p
\v 22 The crowd rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to guard them safely,
\v 24 who, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.
\p
\v 25 But about midnight Sha'ul and Shila were praying and singing hymns to Elohim, and the prisoners were listening to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened.
\v 27 The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
\v 28 But Sha'ul cried with a loud voice, saying, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!"
\p
\v 29 He called for lights, sprang in, fell down trembling before Sha'ul and Shila,
\v 30 brought them out, and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
\s1 The Jailer Believes
\p
\v 31 They said, "Believe in the Master ישוע Messiah, and you will be saved, you and your household."
\v 32 They spoke the word of יהוה to him, and to all who were in his house.
\p
\v 33 He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately immersed, he and all his household.
\v 34 He brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having believed in Elohim.
\p
\v 35 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, "Let those men go."
\p
\v 36 The jailer reported these words to Sha'ul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace."
\p
\v 37 But Sha'ul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No, most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!"
\p
\v 38 The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,
\v 39 and they came and begged them. When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.
\v 40 They went out of the prison, and entered into Ludia's house. When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.
\c 17
\s1 Sha'ul at Thessalonike
\p
\v 1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonike, where there was a Yehudite synagogue.
\v 2 Sha'ul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
\v 3 explaining and demonstrating that the Messiah had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This ישוע, whom I proclaim to you, is the Messiah."
\p
\v 4 Some of them were persuaded, and joined Sha'ul and Shila, of the El-fearing Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women.
\v 5 But the Yehudim, having become envious, took along some evil men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Iason, they sought to bring them out to the people.
\v 6 When they did not find them, they dragged Iason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying, "These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,
\v 7 whom Iason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, ישוע."
\v 8 The crowd and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.
\v 9 When they had taken security from Iason and the rest, they let them go.
\s1 Sha'ul at Berea
\p
\v 10 The brothers immediately sent Sha'ul and Shila away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the Yehudite synagogue.
\v 11 Now these were nobler than those in Thessalonike, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
\v 12 Many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few men.
\v 13 But when the Yehudim of Thessalonike had knowledge that the word of Elohim was proclaimed by Sha'ul at Berea also, they came there likewise, agitating the crowds.
\v 14 Then the brothers immediately sent out Sha'ul to go as far as to the sea, and Shila and Timotheos still stayed there.
\v 15 But those who escorted Sha'ul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a command with Shila and Timotheos that they should come to him very quickly, they departed.
\s1 Sha'ul at Athens
\p
\v 16 Now while Sha'ul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.
\v 17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Yehudim and the El-fearing men, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also were conversing with him. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "He seems to be advocating foreign deities," because he proclaimed ישוע and the resurrection.
\s1 Teaching on the Hill of Ares [Mars]
\p
\v 19 They took hold of him, and brought him to the Hill of Ares, saying, "May we know what this renewed teaching is, which is spoken by you?
\v 20 For you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean."
\v 21 Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some renewed thing.
\p
\v 22 Sha'ul stood in the middle of the Hill of Ares, and said, "You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things.
\v 23 For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your reverence, I found also an altar with this inscription: 'to an unknown el.' Therefore what you revere in ignorance, this I announce to you.
\v 24 The Elohim who made the world and all things in it, He, being Master of heaven and earth, does not dwell in dwelling places made with hands,
\v 25 neither is He served by men's hands, as though He needed anything, seeing He Himself gives life and breath to all, and all things.
\v 26 He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed times, and the boundaries of their dwellings,
\v 27 that they should seek יהוה, if perhaps they might reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.
\p
\v 28 "'For in Him we live, and move, and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'
\v 29 Being then the offspring of Elohim, we ought not to think that the Divine is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man.
\v 30 The times of ignorance therefore Elohim overlooked. But now He commands that all people everywhere should repent,
\v 31 because He has appointed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has ordained; of which He has given faith to all men, in that He has raised Him from the dead."
\p
\v 32 Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, "We want to hear you again concerning this."
\p
\v 33 Thus Sha'ul went out from among them.
\v 34 But certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was Dionusos the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
\c 18
\s1 Sha'ul at Korinth
\p
\v 1 After these things Sha'ul departed from Athens, and came to Korinth.
\v 2 He found a certain Yehudite named Aquila, a man of the people of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy, with his wife Priskilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Yehudim to depart from Rome. He came to them,
\v 3 and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.
\v 4 He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Yehudim and Greeks.
\v 5 But when Shila and Timotheos came down from Makedonia, Sha'ul was compelled by the word, testifying to the Yehudim that ישוע was the Messiah.
\v 6 When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the nations!"
\p
\v 7 He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Ioustus, one who feared Elohim, whose house was next door to the synagogue.
\v 8 Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Master with all his house. Many of the Korinthians, when they heard, believed and were immersed.
\v 9 יהוה said to Sha'ul in the night by a vision, "Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent;
\v 10 for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city."
\p
\v 11 He lived there a year and six new moons, teaching the word of Elohim among them.
\v 12 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Yehudim with one accord rose up against Sha'ul and brought him before the judgment seat,
\v 13 saying, "This man persuades men to fear Elohim in a way contrary to the law."
\p
\v 14 But when Sha'ul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Yehudim, "If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of evil crime, O Yehudim, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;
\v 15 but if there are questions about a word and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I do not want to be a judge of these matters."
\v 16 So he drove them from the judgment seat.
\p
\v 17 Then they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. None of these things mattered to Gallio.
\p
\v 18 Sha'ul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priskilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Kegcreai, for he had a vow.
\v 19 They arrived at Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Yehudim.
\v 20 When they asked him to stay a longer time, he declined;
\v 21 but taking his leave of them, he said, "[I must by all means keep this coming Feast in Yerushalayim, but] I will return again to you if Elohim wills." Then he set sail from Ephesus.
\v 22 When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.
\v 23 Having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the talmidim.
\s1 Apollos Speaking Boldly
\p
\v 24 Now a certain Yehudite named Apollos, of the Alexandrian people, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures.
\v 25 This man had been instructed in the way of יהוה; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning ישוע, although he knew only the immersion of Yoḥanan.
\v 26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priskilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of Elohim more accurately.
\p
\v 27 When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the talmidim to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through favor;
\v 28 for he powerfully refuted the Yehudim, publicly showing by the Scriptures that ישוע was the Messiah.
\c 19
\s1 Sha'ul in Ephesus
\p
\v 1 While Apollos was at Korinth, Sha'ul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain talmidim.
\v 2 He said to them, "Did you receive the Set-apart Ruaḥ when you believed?" They said to him, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Set-apart Ruaḥ."
\p
\v 3 He said, "Into what then were you immersed?" They said, "Into Yoḥanan's immersion."
\p
\v 4 Sha'ul said, "Yoḥanan indeed immersed with the immersion of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in ישוע."
\p
\v 5 When they heard this, they were immersed in the Name of the Master ישוע.
\v 6 When Sha'ul had laid his hands on them, the Set-apart Ruaḥ came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied.
\v 7 They were about twelve men in all.
\v 8 He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three new moons, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of Elohim.
\p
\v 9 But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of The Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the talmidim, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
\v 10 This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of יהוה, both Yehudim and Greeks.
\s1 Sons of Skeva
\p
\v 11 Elohim worked special miracles by the hands of Sha'ul,
\v 12 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.
\v 13 But some of the wandering Yehudim, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the Name of the Master ישוע, saying, "I adjure you by ישוע whom Sha'ul proclaims."
\v 14 There were seven sons of one Skeva, a Yehudite chief priest, who did this.
\p
\v 15 The evil spirit answered, "ישוע I know, and Sha'ul I know, but who are you?"
\v 16 The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered all of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
\v 17 This became known to all, both Yehudim and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the Name of the Master ישוע was magnified.
\v 18 Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.
\v 19 Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted their price, and found it to be fifty thousand drachmas.
\v 20 So the word of the Master was growing and becoming mighty.
\p
\v 21 Now after these things had ended, Sha'ul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Makedonia and Achaia, to go to Yerushalayim, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
\s1 Riot in Ephesus
\p
\v 22 Having sent into Makedonia two of those who served him, Timotheos and Erastos, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
\v 23 About that time there arose no small stir concerning The Way.
\v 24 For a certain man named Demetrios, a silversmith, who made silver dwelling places of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,
\v 25 whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, "Masters, you know that by this business we have our wealth.
\v 26 You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Sha'ul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no elohim, that are made with hands.
\v 27 Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disregard, but also that the temple of the great eloah Artemis will be counted as nothing; she is about to be pulled down from her majesty, whom all Asia and the world fears."
\p
\v 28 When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
\v 29 The city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarḥos, men of Makedonia, Sha'ul's companions in travel.
\v 30 When Sha'ul wanted to enter in to the people, the talmidim did not allow him.
\v 31 Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.
\v 32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them did not know why they had come together.
\v 33 They brought Alexandros out of the crowd, the Yehudim putting him forward. Alexandros informed with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people.
\v 34 But when they perceived that he was a Yehudite, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
\p
\v 35 When the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?
\v 36 Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
\v 37 For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our eloah.
\v 38 If therefore Demetrios and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another.
\v 39 But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.
\v 40 For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning today's riot, there being no cause. Concerning it, we would not be able to give an account of this commotion."
\p
\v 41 When he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
\c 20
\s1 Sha'ul in Makedonia and Greece
\p
\v 1 After the uproar had ceased, Sha'ul sent for the talmidim and, having encouraged them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Makedonia.
\v 2 When he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words, he came into Yavan.
\v 3 When he had spent three new moons there, and a plot was made against him by Yehudim as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Makedonia.
\v 4 These accompanied him: Sopater of Berea, son of Pyrrus; Aristarḥos and Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timotheos; and Tuḥikos and Trophimos of Asia.
\v 5 But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.
\v 6 We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.
\p
\v 7 On day one of the week, we came together to break bread and Sha'ul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight.
\v 8 There were many lights in the upper room where we were gathered together.
\v 9 A certain young man named Eutuḥos sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Sha'ul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third floor, and was taken up dead.
\v 10 Sha'ul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is in him."
\p
\v 11 When he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.
\v 12 They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.
\p
\v 13 But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending to take Sha'ul aboard there; for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.
\v 14 When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitulene.
\v 15 [Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos, and the following day we came to Miletos.]
\v 16 For Sha'ul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Yerushalayim on the day of Pentecost.
\s1 Farewell to Ephesus
\p
\v 17 From Miletos he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly.
\v 18 When they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,
\v 19 serving the Master with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Yehudim;
\v 20 how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,
\v 21 testifying both to Yehudim and to Greeks repentance toward Elohim, and faith toward our Master ישוע.
\p
\v 22 "Now, behold, I go bound by the Ruaḥ to Yerushalayim, not knowing what will happen to me there;
\v 23 except that the Set-apart Ruaḥ testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.
\v 24 But I make my life an account of nothing precious to myself, so that I may finish my race, and the ministry which I received from the Master ישוע, to fully testify to the good news of the favor of Elohim.
\p
\v 25 "Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about proclaiming the Kingdom, will see my face no more.
\v 26 Therefore I testify to you today that I am clean from the blood of all men,
\v 27 for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of Elohim.
\v 28 Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Set-apart Ruaḥ has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of Elohim which He purchased with His own blood.
\v 29 For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
\v 30 Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the talmidim after them.
\v 31 Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.
\v 32 Now, I entrust you to Elohim, and to the word of His favor, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are set apart.
\v 33 I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me.
\v 35 In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Master ישוע, that He Himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
\p
\v 36 When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
\v 37 They all wept a lot, and fell on Sha'ul's neck and kissed him,
\v 38 sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
\c 21
\s1 Sha'ul Sails from Miletos
\p
\v 1 When we had departed from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to Kos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
\v 2 Having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.
\v 3 When we had come in sight of Kupros, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tsor, for there the ship was to unload her cargo.
\v 4 Having found the talmidim, we stayed there seven days. These said to Sha'ul through the Ruaḥ, that he should not go up to Yerushalayim.
\v 5 When those days were over, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.
\v 6 After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.
\p
\v 7 When we had finished the voyage from Tsor, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.
\v 8 On the next day we went out, and came to Caesarea. We entered into the house of Philippos the messenger of the good news, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
\v 9 Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
\v 10 As we stayed there some days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Yehudah.
\v 11 Coming to us, and taking Sha'ul's belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, "Thus says the Set-apart Ruaḥ: 'So will the Yehudim at Yerushalayim bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the nations.'"
\p
\v 12 When we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Yerushalayim.
\v 13 Then Sha'ul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Yerushalayim for the Name of the Master ישוע."
\p
\v 14 When he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The will of יהוה be done."
\s1 Sha'ul at Yerushalayim; Seized at the Temple
\p
\v 15 After these days we , having prepared, went up to Yerushalayim.
\v 16 Some of the talmidim from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Kupros, an early talmid, with whom we would stay.
\p
\v 17 When we had come to Yerushalayim, the brothers received us gladly.
\v 18 The day following, Sha'ul went in with us to Ya'aqov; and all the elders were present.
\v 19 When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things which Elohim had worked among the nations through his ministry.
\v 20 They, when they heard it, glorified Elohim. They said to him, "You see, brother, how many tens of thousands there are among the Yehudim of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Torah.
\v 21 They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Yehudim who are among the nations to forsake Mosheh, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.
\v 22 What then? They will certainly hear that you have come.
\p
\v 23 "Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.
\v 24 Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk guarding the Torah.
\v 25 But concerning the nations who believe, we have written our decision; they should guard themselves from things slaughtered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from whoring."
\p
\v 26 Then Sha'ul took the men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the Temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.
\v 27 When the seven days were almost completed, the Yehudim from Asia, when they saw him in the Temple, stirred up all the crowd and laid hands on him,
\v 28 crying out, "Men of Yisra'el, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the Torah, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the Temple, and has defiled this set-apart place!"
\v 29 For they had previously seen Trophimos, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Sha'ul had brought him into the Temple.
\p
\v 30 All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They seized Sha'ul and dragged him out of the Temple. Immediately the doors were shut.
\v 31 As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Yerushalayim was in an uproar.
\v 32 Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Sha'ul.
\v 33 Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.
\v 34 Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd. When he could not find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.
\p
\v 35 When he came to the stairs, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;
\v 36 for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, "Away with him!"
\v 37 As Sha'ul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, "May I speak something to you?" He said, "Do you know Greek?
\v 38 Are you not then the Mitsrite, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?"
\p
\v 39 But Sha'ul said, "I am a Yehudite, from Tarsus in Kilikia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."
\p
\v 40 When he had given him permission, Sha'ul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,
\c 22
\s1 Sha'ul's Defense before the Yehudim
\p
\v 1 "Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now make to you."
\p
\v 2 When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. He said,
\v 3 "I am indeed a Yehudite, born in Tarsus of Kilikia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamali'el, instructed according to the strict tradition of the law of our fathers, being zealous for Elohim, even as you all are today.
\v 4 I persecuted this 'Way' to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
\v 5 As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and traveled to Dammeseq to bring them also who were there to Yerushalayim in bonds to be punished.
\v 6 As I made my journey, and came close to Dammeseq, about noon, suddenly a great light shone around me from the heavens.
\v 7 I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, 'Sha'ul, Sha'ul, why are you persecuting Me?'
\v 8 I answered, 'Who are You, Master?' He said to me, 'I am ישוע of Nazareth, whom you persecute.'
\p
\v 9 "Those who were with me indeed saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of Him who spoke to me.
\v 10 I said, 'What shall I do, Master?' The Master said to me, 'Arise, and go into Dammeseq. There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.'
\v 11 When I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Dammeseq.
\v 12 One Ḥananyah, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Yehudim who lived in Dammeseq,
\v 13 came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Sha'ul, receive your sight!' In that very hour I looked up at him.
\v 14 He said, 'The Elohim of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from His mouth.
\v 15 For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
\v 16 Now why do you wait? Arise, be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on His Name.'
\p
\v 17 "When I had returned to Yerushalayim, and while I prayed in the Temple, I fell into a state of astonishment,
\v 18 and saw Him saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Yerushalayim quickly, because they will not receive witness concerning Me from you.'
\v 19 I said, 'Master, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in You.
\v 20 When the blood of Stephanos, Your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.'
\p
\v 21 "He said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the nations.'"
\p
\v 22 They listened to him until he said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, "Rid the earth of this fellow, for he is not fit to live!"
\p
\v 23 As they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,
\v 24 the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like that.
\v 25 When they stretched him out with thongs, Sha'ul asked the centurion who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?"
\p
\v 26 When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, "What are you about to do? This man is a Roman!"
\p
\v 27 The commanding officer came and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes."
\p
\v 28 The commanding officer answered, "I bought my citizenship for a great price." Sha'ul said, "But I was born a Roman."
\p
\v 29 Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.
\v 30 But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Yehudim, he freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together, and brought Sha'ul down and set him before them.
\c 23
\s1 Sha'ul before the Sanhedrin
\p
\v 1 Sha'ul, looking steadfastly at the Sanhedrin, said, "Brothers, I have lived before Elohim in all good conscience until today."
\p
\v 2 The high priest, Ḥananyah, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
\p
\v 3 Then Sha'ul said to him, "Elohim will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the Torah, and command me to be struck contrary to the Torah?"
\p
\v 4 Those who stood by said, "Do you malign the high priest of Elohim?"
\p
\v 5 Sha'ul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"
\v 6 But when Sha'ul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"
\p
\v 7 When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the crowd was divided.
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor messenger, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.
\v 9 A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' part stood up, and contended, saying, "We find no evil in this man. What if a spirit or messenger has spoken to him?"
\v 10 When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Sha'ul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.
\p
\v 11 The following night, the Master stood by him, and said, "Take courage, for as you have testified about Me at Yerushalayim, so you must testify also at Rome."
\s1 Plot to Kill Sha'ul
\p
\v 12 When it was day, the Yehudim banded together, and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Sha'ul.
\v 13 There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.
\v 14 They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Sha'ul.
\v 15 Now therefore, you with the Sanhedrin inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are ready to kill him before he comes near."
\p
\v 16 But Sha'ul's sister's son heard they were lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Sha'ul.
\v 17 Sha'ul summoned one of the centurions, and said, "Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him."
\p
\v 18 So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer, and said, "Sha'ul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to tell you."
\p
\v 19 The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"
\p
\v 20 He said, "The Yehudim have agreed to ask you to bring Sha'ul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.
\v 21 Therefore do not yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."
\s1 Sha'ul Moved to Caesarea
\p
\v 22 So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, "Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me."
\v 23 He called to himself two of the centurions, and said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night."
\v 24 He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Sha'ul on one, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
\v 25 He wrote a letter like this:
\p
\v 26 "Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
\v 27 This man was seized by the Yehudim, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
\v 28 Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin.
\v 29 I found him to be accused about questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of death or of imprisonment.
\v 30 When I was told that the Yehudim lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you."
\p
\v 31 So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Sha'ul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
\v 32 But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks.
\v 33 When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Sha'ul to him.
\v 34 When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he understood that he was from Kilikia, he said,
\v 35 "I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive." He commanded that he be guarded in Herod's palace.
\c 24
\s1 Sha'ul before Felix
\p
\v 1 After five days, the high priest, Ḥananyah, came down with some of the elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Sha'ul.
\v 2 When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that reforms are coming to this nation by your foresight,
\v 3 we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
\v 4 But, that I do not delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.
\v 5 For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Yehudim throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
\v 6 He even tried to profane the Temple, and we arrested him,
\v 7 [and we would have judged him in accordance with our law. But the commander Lysias came and took him from us with much violence.]
\v 8 By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him."
\p
\v 9 The Yehudim also joined in the attack, believing that these things were so.
\v 10 When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Sha'ul answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,
\v 11 seeing that you can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to bow down at Yerushalayim.
\v 12 In the Temple they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.
\v 13 Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.
\v 14 But this I confess to you, that after 'The Way,' which they call a sect, so I serve the Elohim of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the Torah, and which are written in the prophets;
\v 15 having hope toward Elohim, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust.
\v 16 Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward Elohim and men.
\p
\v 17 "Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;
\v 18 amid which certain Yehudim from Asia found me purified in the Temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.
\v 19 They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.
\v 20 Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin,
\v 21 unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!'"
\p
\v 22 But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning 'The Way,' deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case."
\v 23 He ordered the centurion that Sha'ul should be guarded, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his own people to serve him or to visit him.
\v 24 But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Yehudite, and sent for Sha'ul, and heard him concerning the faith in Messiah ישוע.
\v 25 As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you."
\v 26 Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Sha'ul, [that he might release him.] Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.
\v 27 But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Yehudim, Felix left Sha'ul in bonds.
\c 25
\s1 Sha'ul before Festus
\p
\v 1 Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Yerushalayim from Caesarea.
\v 2 Then the high priest and the principal men of the Yehudim informed him against Sha'ul, and they begged him,
\v 3 asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Yerushalayim; plotting to kill him on the way.
\v 4 However Festus answered that Sha'ul should be guarded at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly.
\v 5 "Let them therefore," he said, "that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him."
\p
\v 6 When he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Sha'ul to be brought.
\v 7 When he had come, the Yehudim who had come down from Yerushalayim stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove,
\v 8 while he said in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Yehudim, nor against the Temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all."
\p
\v 9 But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Yehudim, answered Sha'ul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Yerushalayim, and be judged by me there concerning these things?"
\p
\v 10 But Sha'ul said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Yehudim, as you also know very well.
\v 11 For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!"
\p
\v 12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall go."
\p
\v 13 Now when some days had passed, King Agrippas and Bernike arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.
\v 14 As they were staying there many days, Festus laid Sha'ul's case before the king, saying, "There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;
\v 15 about whom, when I was at Yerushalayim, the chief priests and the elders of the Yehudim informed me, asking for a sentence against him.
\v 16 To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, before the accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.
\v 17 When therefore they had come together here, I did not delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought.
\v 18 Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evils as I supposed;
\v 19 but had certain questions against him about their own religion, and about one ישוע, who had died, whom Sha'ul believed to be alive.
\v 20 Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Yerushalayim and there be judged concerning these matters.
\v 21 But when Sha'ul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be guarded until I could send him to Caesar."
\p
\v 22 Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he said, "you shall hear him."
\s1 Sha'ul before Agrippas
\p
\v 23 So on the next day, when Agrippas and Bernike had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and the principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Sha'ul was brought in.
\p
\v 24 Festus said, "King Agrippas, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Yehudim petitioned me, both at Yerushalayim and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
\v 25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him,
\v 26 of whom I have no certain thing to write to my master. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippas, that after examination, I may have something to write.
\v 27 For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him."
\c 26
\s1 Sha'ul's Defense before Agrippas
\p
\v 1 Agrippas said to Sha'ul, "You may speak for yourself." Then Sha'ul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.
\v 2 "I think myself happy, King Agrippas, that I am to make my defense before you today concerning all the things that I am accused by the Yehudim,
\v 3 especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Yehudim. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.
\p
\v 4 "Indeed, all the Yehudim know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Yerushalayim;
\v 5 having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
\v 6 Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by Elohim to our fathers,
\v 7 which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Yehudim, O King!
\v 8 Why is it judged unfaithful with you, if Elohim raises the dead?
\v 9 I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the Name of ישוע of Nazareth.
\v 10 This I also did in Yerushalayim. I both closed up many of the set-apart ones in prisons – having received authority from the chief priests – and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.
\v 11 Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
\p
\v 12 "Whereupon as I traveled to Dammeseq with the authority and commission from the chief priests,
\v 13 at noon, O king, I saw on the way a light from the heavens, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me.
\v 14 When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Sha'ul, Sha'ul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
\p
\v 15 "I said, 'Who are You, Master?' "He said, 'I am ישוע, whom you are persecuting.
\v 16 But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you;
\v 17 delivering you from the people, and from the nations, to whom I send you,
\v 18 to open their eyes, to turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to Elohim, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are set apart by faith in Me.'
\p
\v 19 "Therefore, King Agrippas, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
\v 20 but declared first to them of Dammeseq, at Yerushalayim, and throughout all the country of Yehudah, and also to the nations, that they should repent and turn to Elohim, doing works worthy of repentance.
\v 21 For this reason the Yehudim seized me in the Temple, and tried to kill me.
\v 22 Having therefore obtained the help that is from Elohim, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Mosheh said would happen,
\v 23 how the Messiah must suffer, and how, from the resurrection of the dead, He would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the nations."
\p
\v 24 As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Sha'ul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!"
\p
\v 25 But he said, "I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness.
\v 26 For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner.
\v 27 King Agrippas, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
\p
\v 28 Agrippas said to Sha'ul, "With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a 'Christian'?"
\p
\v 29 Sha'ul said, "I pray to Elohim, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me today, might become such as I am, except for these bonds."
\p
\v 30 The king rose up with the governor, and Bernike, and those who sat with them.
\v 31 When they had withdrawn, they spoke to one another, saying, "This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
\v 32 Agrippas said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
\c 27
\s1 Sha'ul Sent to Rome
\p
\v 1 When it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Sha'ul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Iulius, of the Augustan band.
\v 2 Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarḥos, a Makedonian of Thessalonike, being with us.
\p
\v 3 The next day, we touched at Tsidon. Iulius treated Sha'ul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself.
\v 4 Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Kupros, because the winds were contrary.
\v 5 When we had sailed across the sea which is off Kilikia and Pamphylia, we came to Mura, a city of Lukia.
\v 6 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board.
\p
\v 7 When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Knidos, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
\v 8 With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasaia.
\p
\v 9 When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Sha'ul admonished them,
\v 10 and said to them, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
\v 11 But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Sha'ul.
\v 12 Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.
\s1 Shipwreck
\p
\v 13 When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.
\v 14 But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Eurakulon.
\v 15 When the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along.
\v 16 Running under the lee of a small island called Kauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.
\v 17 After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Surtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along.
\v 18 As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.
\v 19 On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands.
\v 20 When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.
\p
\v 21 When they had been long without food, Sha'ul stood up in the middle of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.
\v 22 Now I exhort you to take courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
\v 23 For there stood by me this night a messenger, belonging to the Elohim whose I am and whom I serve,
\v 24 saying, 'Do not be afraid, Sha'ul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, Elohim has granted you all those who sail with you.'
\v 25 Therefore, sirs, take courage! For I believe Elohim, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.
\v 26 But we must run aground on a certain island."
\p
\v 27 But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.
\v 28 They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms. After a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and prayed for daylight.
\v 30 As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,
\v 31 Sha'ul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
\p
\v 33 While the day was coming on, Sha'ul begged them all to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.
\v 34 Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads."
\v 35 When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to Elohim in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat.
\v 36 Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.
\v 37 In all, we were two hundred seventy-six beings on the ship.
\v 38 When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
\v 39 When it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it.
\v 40 Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
\v 41 But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.
\p
\v 42 The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.
\v 43 But the centurion, desiring to save Sha'ul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;
\v 44 and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So they all escaped safely to the land.
\c 28
\s1 Safety at Malta
\p
\v 1 When we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Malta.
\v 2 The natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
\v 3 But when Sha'ul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
\v 4 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet 'Justice' has not allowed to live."
\v 5 However he shook off the creature into the fire, and was not harmed.
\v 6 But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was an el.
\p
\v 7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for three days.
\v 8 The father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Sha'ul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.
\v 9 Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured.
\v 10 They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.
\s1 Sha'ul's Arrival at Rome
\p
\v 11 After three new moons, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Brothers."
\v 12 Touching at Surakousai, we stayed there three days.
\v 13 From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,
\v 14 where we found brothers, and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome.
\v 15 From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Sha'ul saw them, he thanked Elohim, and took courage.
\v 16 When we entered into Rome, Sha'ul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
\p
\v 17 After three days Sha'ul called together those who were the leaders of the Yehudim. When they had come together, he said to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Yerushalayim into the hands of the Romans,
\v 18 who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.
\v 19 But when the Yehudim spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.
\v 20 For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Yisra'el I am bound with this chain."
\p
\v 21 They said to him, "We neither received letters from Yehudah concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.
\v 22 But we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."
\p
\v 23 When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about the Kingdom of Elohim, and persuading them concerning ישוע, both from the Torah of Mosheh and from the prophets, from morning until evening.
\v 24 Some were persuaded the things which were spoken, and some did not believe.
\v 25 When they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Sha'ul had spoken one word, "The Set-apart Ruaḥ spoke rightly through Yeshayahu, the prophet, to your fathers,
\v 26 saying, 'Go to this people, and say, "in hearing, you will hear, but will in no way understand. In seeing, you will see, but will in no way perceive."
\v 27 For this people's heart has grown callous. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.'
\p
\v 28 "Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of Elohim is sent to the nations, and they will listen."
\p
\v 29 [When he had said these words, the Yehudim departed, having a great dispute among themselves.]
\v 30 Sha'ul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him,
\v 31 proclaiming the Kingdom of Elohim, and teaching the things concerning the Master ישוע Messiah with all boldness, without hindrance.
