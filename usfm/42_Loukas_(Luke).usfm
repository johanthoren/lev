\s1 Introduction
\p
\v 1 Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
\v 2 even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,
\v 3 it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;
\v 4 that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
\s1 Birth of Yoḥanan the Immerser Foretold
\p
\v 5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Yehudah, a certain priest named Zekharyah, of the priestly division of Aviyah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aharon, and her name was Elisheva.
\v 6 They were both righteous before Elohim, walking blamelessly in all the commands and righteous deeds of יהוה.
\v 7 But they had no child, because Elisheva was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.
\v 8 Now while he executed the priest's office before Elohim in the order of his division,
\v 9 according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the dwelling place of יהוה and burn incense.
\v 10 The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.
\p
\v 11 A messenger of יהוה appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
\v 12 Zekharyah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
\v 13 But the messenger said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zekharyah, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elisheva, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Yoḥanan.
\v 14 You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.
\v 15 For he will be great in the sight of יהוה, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Set-apart Ruaḥ, even from his mother's womb.
\v 16 He will turn many of the children of Yisra'el to יהוה their Elohim.
\v 17 He will go before Him in the spirit and power of Eliyahu, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for יהוה."
\p
\v 18 Zekharyah said to the messenger, "How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."
\p
\v 19 The messenger answered him, "I am Gavri'el, who stands in the presence of Elohim. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.
\v 20 Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
\p
\v 21 The people were waiting for Zekharyah, and they marveled that he delayed in the dwelling place.
\v 22 When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the dwelling place. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.
\v 23 When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.
\v 24 After these days Elisheva, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five new moons, saying,
\v 25 "Thus has יהוה done to me in the days in which He looked at me, to take away my reproach among men."
\s1 Birth of ישוע Foretold
\p
\v 26 Now in the sixth new moon, the messenger Gavri'el was sent from Elohim to a city of the Galil, named Nazareth,
\v 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Yoseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Miryam.
\v 28 Having come in, the messenger said to her, "Rejoice, you highly favored one! יהוה is with you."
\p
\v 29 But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
\v 30 The messenger said to her, "Do not be afraid, Miryam, for you have found favor with Elohim.
\v 31 Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and give birth to a son, and will call His Name 'ישוע.'
\v 32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of Elyon. יהוה Elohim will give Him the throne of His father, David,
\v 33 and He will reign over the house of Ya'aqov to the ages. There will be no end to His Kingdom."
\p
\v 34 Miryam said to the messenger, "How can this be, seeing I have not known a man?"
\p
\v 35 The messenger answered her, "The Set-apart Ruaḥ will come on you, and the power of Elyon will overshadow you. Therefore also the set-apart One who is born will be called the Son of Elohim.
\v 36 Behold, Elisheva, your relative, also has conceived a son, in her old age; and this is the sixth new moon with her who was called barren.
\v 37 For nothing is impossible with Elohim."
\p
\v 38 Miryam said, "Behold, the servant of יהוה; let it be done to me according to your word." The messenger departed from her.
\s1 Miryam Visits Elisheva
\p
\v 39 Miryam arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Yehudah,
\v 40 and entered into the house of Zekharyah and greeted Elisheva.
\v 41 When Elisheva heard Miryam's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elisheva was filled with the Set-apart Ruaḥ.
\v 42 She called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
\v 43 Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Master should come to me?
\v 44 For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
\v 45 Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from יהוה!"
\s1 Miryam's Words of Praise
\p
\v 46 Miryam said, "My being magnifies יהוה.
\v 47 My spirit has rejoiced in Elohim my Savior,
\v 48 for He has looked at the humble state of His servant. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
\v 49 For He who is mighty has done great things for me. Set-apart is His Name.
\v 50 His loving-kindness is for generations of generations on those who fear Him.
\v 51 He has shown strength with His arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
\v 52 He has put down princes from their thrones. And has exalted the lowly.
\v 53 He has filled the hungry with good things. He has sent the rich away empty.
\v 54 He has given help to Yisra'el, His servant, that he might remember loving-kindness,
\v 55 as He spoke to our fathers, to Avraham and his seed to the age."
\p
\v 56 Miryam stayed with her about three new moons, and then returned to her house.
\s1 Birth of Yoḥanan
\p
\v 57 Now the time that Elisheva should give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son.
\v 58 Her neighbors and her relatives heard that יהוה had magnified His loving-kindness towards her, and they rejoiced with her.
\v 59 On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zekharyah, after the name of his father.
\v 60 His mother answered, "Not so; but he will be called Yoḥanan."
\p
\v 61 They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."
\v 62 They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
\p
\v 63 He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is Yoḥanan." They all marveled.
\v 64 His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing Elohim.
\v 65 Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Yehudah.
\v 66 All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, "What then will this child be?" The hand of יהוה was with him.
\s1 Zekharyah's Words of Praise, Prophecy
\p
\v 67 His father, Zekharyah, was filled with the Set-apart Ruaḥ, and prophesied, saying,
\v 68 "Blessed be יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, for He has visited and redeemed His people;
\v 69 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David
\v 70 (as He spoke by the mouth of His set-apart prophets who have been from the age),
\v 71 salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
\v 72 to show loving-kindness towards our fathers, to remember His set-apart covenant,
\v 73 the oath which He swore to Avraham, our father,
\v 74 to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, should serve Him without fear,
\v 75 in set-apartness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.
\p
\v 76 "And you, child, will be called a prophet of Elyon, for you will go before יהוה to prepare His ways,
\v 77 to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,
\v 78 because of the tender loving-kindness of our Elohim, whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,
\v 79 to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace."
\p
\v 80 The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the wildernesses until the day of his public appearance to Yisra'el.
\p
\c 2
\s1 Birth of ישוע
\p
\v 1 Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.
\v 2 This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
\v 3 All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.
\v 4 Yoseph also went up from the Galil, out of the city of Nazareth, into Yehudah, to the city of David, which is called Beth-leḥem, because he was of the house and family of David;
\v 5 to enroll himself with Miryam, who was betrothed to him, being pregnant.
\p
\v 6 While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth.
\v 7 She gave birth to her Firstborn Son. She wrapped Him in bands of cloth, and laid Him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the guestroom.
\v 8 There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and guarding watch by night over their flock.
\v 9 Behold, a messenger of יהוה stood by them, and the glory of יהוה shone around them, and they feared with great fear.
\v 10 The messenger said to them, "Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.
\v 11 For there is born to you today, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Messiah the Master.
\v 12 This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough."
\v 13 Suddenly, there was with the messenger a multitude of the heavenly army praising Elohim, and saying,
\p
\v 14 "Glory to Elohim in the highest; on earth: peace among whom He is pleased."
\p
\v 15 When the messengers went away from them into the heavens, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go to Beth-leḥem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which יהוה has made known to us."
\v 16 They came with haste, and found both Miryam and Yoseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
\v 17 When they saw it, they made known the saying which was spoken to them about this Child.
\v 18 All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.
\v 19 But Miryam kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
\v 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising Elohim for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.
\s1 ישוע's Circumcision and Presentation at the Temple
\p
\v 21 When eight days were fulfilled to circumcise Him, His Name was called ישוע, which was given by the messenger before He was conceived in the womb.
\p
\v 22 When the days of their purification according to the Torah of Mosheh were fulfilled, they brought Him up to Yerushalayim, to present Him to יהוה
\v 23 (as it is written in the Torah of יהוה, "Every male who opens the womb shall be called set-apart to יהוה,")
\v 24 and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Torah of יהוה, "A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
\p
\v 25 Behold, there was a man in Yerushalayim whose name was Shimon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Yisra'el, and the Set-apart Ruaḥ was on him.
\v 26 It had been revealed to him by the Set-apart Ruaḥ that he should not see death before he had seen the Messiah of יהוה.
\v 27 He came in the Ruaḥ into the Temple. When the parents brought in the child, ישוע, that they might do concerning Him according to the custom of the Torah,
\v 28 then he received Him into his arms, and blessed Elohim, and said,
\v 29 "Now You are releasing Your bondservant, Master, according to Your word, in peace;
\v 30 for my eyes have seen Your salvation,
\v 31 which You have prepared before the face of all peoples;
\v 32 a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of Your people Yisra'el."
\p
\v 33 Yoseph and His mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning Him,
\v 34 and Shimon blessed them, and said to Miryam, his mother, "Behold, this Child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Yisra'el, and for a sign which is spoken against.
\v 35 Yes, a sword will pierce through your own being, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
\p
\v 36 There was one Ḥannah, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanu'el, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
\v 37 and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who did not depart from the Temple, serving with fastings and petitions night and day.
\v 38 Coming up at that very hour, giving thanks to יהוה, and spoke of Him to all those who were looking for redemption in Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 39 When they had accomplished all things that were according to the Torah of יהוה, they returned into the Galil, to their own city, Nazareth.
\v 40 The Child was growing, and was becoming strong, being filled with wisdom, and the favor of Elohim was upon Him.
\s1 ישוע in the Temple at Twelve Years Old
\p
\v 41 His parents went every year to Yerushalayim at the Feast of the Pesaḥ.
\v 42 When He was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast,
\v 43 and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy ישוע stayed behind in Yerushalayim. His parents did not know it,
\v 44 but supposing Him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they looked for Him among their relatives and acquaintances.
\v 45 When they did not find Him, they returned to Yerushalayim, looking for Him.
\v 46 After three days they found Him in the Temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.
\v 47 All who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.
\v 48 When they saw Him, they were astonished, and His mother said to Him, "Son, why have You treated us this way? Behold, Your father and I were anxiously looking for You."
\p
\v 49 He said to them, "Why were you looking for Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?"
\v 50 They did not understand the saying which He spoke to them.
\v 51 And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
\v 52 And ישוע increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with Elohim and men.
\c 3
\s1 Work of Yoḥanan the Immerser
\p
\v 1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Yehudah, and Herod being tetrarch of the Galil, and his brother Philippos tetrarch of the region of Yetur and Traḥonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
\v 2 in the high priesthood of Ḥananyah and Qayapha, the word of Elohim came to Yoḥanan, the son of Zekharyah, in the wilderness.
\v 3 He came into all the region around the Yarden, proclaiming the immersion of repentance for remission of sins.
\v 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Yeshayahu the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of יהוה. Make His paths straight.
\v 5 Every valley will be filled. Every mountain and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become straight, and the rough ways smooth.
\v 6 All flesh will see the salvation of Elohim.'"
\p
\v 7 He said therefore to the crowds who went out to be immersed by him, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Avraham for our father;' for I tell you that Elohim is able to raise up children to Avraham from these stones!
\v 9 Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire."
\p
\v 10 The crowds asked him, "What then must we do?"
\p
\v 11 He answered them, "He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise."
\p
\v 12 Tax collectors also came to be immersed, and they said to him, "Teacher, what must we do?"
\v 13 He said to them, "Collect no more than that which is appointed to you."
\v 14 Soldiers also asked him, saying, "What about us? What must we do?" He said to them, "Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages."
\p
\v 15 As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning Yoḥanan, whether perhaps he was the Messiah,
\v 16 Yoḥanan answered them all, "I indeed immerse you with water, but He comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will immerse you in the Set-apart Ruaḥ and fire,
\v 17 whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
\p
\v 18 Then with many other exhortations he proclaimed good news to the people,
\v 19 but Herod the tetrarch – being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done –
\v 20 added this also to them all, that he closed up Yoḥanan in prison.
\s1 Immersion of ישוע
\p
\v 21 Now when all the people were immersed, ישוע also had been immersed, and was praying. The heavens were opened,
\v 22 and the Set-apart Ruaḥ descended in a bodily form like a dove on Him; and a voice came out of the heavens, saying "You are My beloved Son. In You I am well-pleased."
\p
\v 23 ישוע himself, when He began to teach, was about thirty years old, being son (as was supposed) of Yoseph, of Eli,
\v 24 of Methuselaḥ, of Levi, of Malki, of Yanna, of Yoseph,
\v 25 of Mattithyahu, of Amos, of Naḥum, of Elihoenai, of Nogah,
\v 26 of Ma'ath, of Mattithyahu, of Shimi, of Yoseph, of Yehudah,
\v 27 of Yoḥanan, of Rephayah, of Zerubbavel, of Shealti'el, of Neri,
\v 28 of Malki, of Addi, of Qasam, of Almodad, of Er,
\v 29 of Yehoshua, of Eliezer, of Yoram, of Methuselaḥ, of Levi,
\v 30 of Shimon, of Yehudah, of Yoseph, of Yonan, of Elyaqim,
\v 31 of Melea, of Menan, of Mattatha, of Nathan, of David,
\v 32 of Yishai, of Oved, of Boaz, of Salmon, of Naḥshon,
\v 33 of Amminadav, of Aram, of Ḥetsron, of Perets, of Yehudah,
\v 34 of Ya'aqov, of Yitsḥaq, of Avraham, of Teraḥ, of Naḥor,
\v 35 of Serug, of Reu, of Peleg, of Ever, of Shelaḥ,
\v 36 of Kena'an, of Arpakshad, of Shem, of Noaḥ, of Lamekh,
\v 37 of Methuselaḥ, of Ḥanokh, of Yared, of Mahalale'el, of Qenan,
\v 38 of Enosh, of Sheth, of Adam, of Elohim.

\s1 Temptation of ישוע
\p
\v 1 ישוע, full of the Set-apart Ruaḥ, returned from the Yarden, and was led by the Ruaḥ into the wilderness
\v 2 for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. When they were completed, He was hungry.
\v 3 The devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of Elohim, command this stone to become bread."
\p
\v 4 ישוע answered him, saying, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, [but by every word of Elohim.]'"
\p
\v 5 He, leading Him up, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
\v 6 The devil said to Him, "I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.
\v 7 If You therefore will bow down before me, it will all be Yours."
\p
\v 8 ישוע answered him, "[Get behind me Satan!] For it is written, 'You shall bow down to יהוה your Elohim, and you shall serve Him only.'"
\p
\v 9 He led Him to Yerushalayim, and set Him on the pinnacle of the Temple, and said to Him, "If You are the Son of Elohim, cast Yourself down from here,
\v 10 for it is written, 'He will put His messengers in charge of you, to guard you;'
\v 11 and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.'"
\p
\v 12 ישוע answering, said to him, "It has been said, 'You shall not tempt יהוה your Elohim.'"
\p
\v 13 When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from Him until another time.
\v 14 ישוע returned in the power of the Ruaḥ into the Galil, and news about Him spread through all the surrounding area.
\v 15 He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
\s1 Teaching in Nazareth
\p
\v 16 He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. He entered, as was His custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.
\v 17 The book of the prophet Yeshayahu was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
\p
\v 18 "The Ruaḥ of יהוה is on Me, because He has anointed Me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent Me [to heal the broken hearted], to proclaim release to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed,
\v 19 and to proclaim the acceptable year of יהוה."
\p
\v 20 He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on Him.
\v 21 He began to tell them, "Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."
\p
\v 22 All testified about Him, and wondered at the favorable words which proceeded out of His mouth, and they said, "Is this not Yoseph's son?"
\p
\v 23 He said to them, "Doubtless you will tell me this parable, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Kaphar-naḥum, do also here in your hometown.'"
\p
\v 24 He said, "Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.
\v 25 But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Yisra'el in the days of Eliyahu, when the heavens were closed up for three years and six new moons, when a great famine came over all the land.
\v 26 Eliyahu was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Tsidon, to a woman who was a widow.
\v 27 There were many lepers in Yisra'el in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed except Na'aman, the Aramean."
\p
\v 28 They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things.
\v 29 They rose up, threw Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw Him off the cliff.
\v 30 But He, passing through the middle of them, went His way.
\s1 Demon Cast Out
\p
\v 31 He came down to Kaphar-naḥum, a city of the Galil. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,
\v 32 and they were astonished at His teaching, for His word was with authority.
\v 33 In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
\v 34 saying, "Ah! what have we to do with You, ישוע of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You and who You are: the Set-apart One of Elohim!"
\p
\v 35 ישוע rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!" When the demon had thrown him down in the middle of them, he came out of him, having done him no harm.
\p
\v 36 Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, "What is this word? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!"
\v 37 News about Him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
\s1 Healing of Kepha's Mother-in-Law and Others
\p
\v 38 He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Shimon's house. Shimon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged Him for her.
\v 39 He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.
\v 40 When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them, and healed them.
\v 41 Demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, "You are the Son of Elohim!" Rebuking them, He did not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Messiah.
\p
\v 42 When it was day, He departed and went into a wilderness region, and the crowds looked for Him, and came to Him, and held on to Him, so that He would not go away from them.
\v 43 But He said to them, "I must proclaim the good news of the Kingdom of Elohim to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent."
\v 44 He was proclaiming in the synagogues of Yehudah.
\c 5
\s1 The First Talmidim
\p
\v 1 Now while the crowd pressed on Him and heard the word of Elohim, He was standing by the lake of Kinnereth.
\v 2 He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
\v 3 He entered into one of the boats, which was Shimon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.
\v 4 When He had finished speaking, He said to Shimon, "Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch."
\p
\v 5 Shimon answered him, "Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at Your word I will let down the nets."
\v 6 When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.
\v 7 They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.
\v 8 But Shimon Kepha, when he saw it, fell down at ישוע's knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Master."
\v 9 For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;
\v 10 and so also were Ya'aqov and Yoḥanan, sons of Zevadyahu, who were partners with Shimon. ישוע said to Shimon, "Do not be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive."
\p
\v 11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed Him.
\s1 Healing of a Leper and Paralytic
\p
\v 12 While He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw ישוע, he fell on his face, and begged Him, saying, "Master, if You want to, You can make me clean."
\p
\v 13 He stretched out His hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean." Immediately the leprosy left him.
\v 14 He commanded him to tell no one, "But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Mosheh commanded, for a witness to them."
\v 15 But the report concerning Him spread much more, and great crowds came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.
\v 16 But He withdrew Himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
\p
\v 17 On one of those days, He was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of the Galil, Yehudah, and Yerushalayim. The power of יהוה was with Him to heal.
\v 18 Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before ישוע.
\v 19 Not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the middle before ישוע.
\v 20 Seeing their faith, He said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."
\p
\v 21 The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but Elohim alone?"
\p
\v 22 But ישוע, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?
\v 23 Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?'
\v 24 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" (he said to the paralyzed man), "I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house."
\p
\v 25 Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying Elohim.
\v 26 Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified Elohim. They were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."
\s1 Calling of Levi
\p
\v 27 After these things He went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, "Follow Me!"
\p
\v 28 He left everything, and rose up and followed Him.
\v 29 Levi made a great feast for Him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.
\v 30 Their scribes and the Pharisees grumbled against His talmidim, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"
\v 31 ישוע answered them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
\v 32 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
\p
\v 33 They said to Him, "Yoḥanan's talmidim often fast and pray, likewise also the talmidim of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink."
\p
\v 34 He said to them, "Can you make the sons of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
\v 35 But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days."
\v 36 He also told a parable to them. "No one puts a piece from a renewed garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the renewed, and also the piece from the renewed will not match the old.
\v 37 No one puts new wine into old wine skins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.
\v 38 But new wine must be put into renewed wine skins.
\v 39 No man having drunk old wine desires new, for he says, 'The old is better.'"
\c 6
\s1 Master of the Sabbath
\p
\v 1 Now on the Sabbath, He was going through the grain fields. His talmidim plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.
\v 2 But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"
\p
\v 3 ישוע, answering them, said, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;
\v 4 how he entered into the house of Elohim, and took and ate the set-apart bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?"
\v 5 He said to them, "The Son of Man is Master of the Sabbath."
\p
\v 6 It also happened on another Sabbath that He entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.
\v 7 The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether He would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against Him.
\v 8 But He knew their thoughts; and He said to the man who had the withered hand, "Rise up, and stand in the middle." He arose and stood.
\v 9 Then ישוע said to them, "I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to destroy?"
\v 10 He looked around at them all, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was restored [as the other].
\v 11 But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to ישוע.
\s1 Choosing the Twelve
\p
\v 12 In these days, He went out to the mountain to pray, and He continued all night in prayer to Elohim.
\v 13 When it was day, He called His talmidim, and from them He chose twelve, whom He also named sheliḥim:
\v 14 Shimon, whom He also named Kepha; Andreas, his brother; Ya'aqov; Yoḥanan; Philippos; Bar-Talmai;
\v 15 Mattithyahu; Taom; Ya'aqov, the son of Ḥeleph; Shimon, who was called the Zealot;
\v 16 Yehudah the son of Ya'aqov; and Yehudah Ish-Qerioth, who also became a traitor.
\v 17 He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a large crowd of His talmidim, and a great number of the people from all Yehudah and Yerushalayim, and the sea coast of Tsor and Tsidon, who came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases;
\v 18 as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.
\v 19 All the crowd sought to touch Him, for power came out of Him and healed them all.
\p
\v 20 He lifted up His eyes to His talmidim, and said, "Blessed are you who are poor, the Kingdom of Elohim is yours.
\v 21 "Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
\v 22 "Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake.
\v 23 Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.
\p
\v 24 "But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.
\v 25 Woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
\v 26 Woe, when men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.
\p
\v 27 "But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
\v 28 bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.
\v 29 To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your coat also.
\v 30 Give to everyone who asks you, and do not ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.
\p
\v 31 "As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.
\v 32 If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.
\v 35 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of Elyon; for He is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
\p
\v 36 "Therefore be kind, even as your Father is also kind.
\v 37 Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free.
\p
\v 38 "Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you."
\p
\v 39 He spoke a parable to them. "Can the blind guide the blind? Will they both not fall into a pit?
\v 40 A talmid is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.
\v 41 Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye, but do not consider the beam that is in your own eye?
\v 42 Or how can you tell your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye.
\v 43 For there is no good tree that produces bad fruit; nor again a bad tree that produces good fruit.
\v 44 For each tree is known from its own fruit. For people do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.
\v 45 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.
\s1 Builders and Foundations
\p
\v 46 "Why do you call Me, 'Master, Master,' and do not do the things which I say?
\v 47 Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.
\v 48 He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was built well.
\v 49 But he who hears, and does not do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great."
\c 7
\s1 Healing of a Centurion's Servant
\p
\v 1 After He had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, He entered into Kaphar-naḥum.
\v 2 A certain centurion's bondservant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.
\v 3 When he heard about ישוע, he sent to Him elders of the Yehudim, asking Him to come and save his bondservant.
\v 4 When they came to ישוע, they begged Him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for You to do this for him,
\v 5 for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us."
\v 6 ישוע went with them. When He was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, "Master, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy for You to come under my roof.
\v 7 Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.
\v 8 For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my bondservant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
\p
\v 9 When ישוע heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd who followed Him, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Yisra'el."
\v 10 Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the bondservant who had been sick was well.
\p
\v 11 Soon afterwards, He went to a city called Na'ah. His talmidim, along with a great crowd, went with Him.
\v 12 Now when He came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only begotten son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.
\v 13 When the Master saw her, He had compassion on her, and said to her, "Do not cry."
\v 14 He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I tell you, arise!"
\v 15 He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And He gave him to his mother.
\p
\v 16 Fear took hold of all, and they glorified Elohim, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us!" and, "Elohim has visited His people!"
\v 17 This report went out concerning Him in the whole of Yehudah, and in all the surrounding region.
\s1 Questions from Yoḥanan
\p
\v 18 The talmidim of Yoḥanan told him about all these things.
\v 19 Yoḥanan, calling to himself two of his talmidim, sent them to ישוע, saying, "Are You the one who is coming, or should we look for another?"
\v 20 When the men had come to him, they said, "Yoḥanan the Immerser has sent us to You, saying, 'Are You He who comes, or should we look for another?'"
\p
\v 21 In that hour He cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind He gave sight.
\v 22 ישוע answered them, "Go and tell Yoḥanan the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news proclaimed to them.
\v 23 Blessed is he who does not stumble in Me."
\p
\v 24 When Yoḥanan's messengers had departed, he began to tell the crowds about Yoḥanan, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.
\v 26 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.
\v 27 This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.'
\p
\v 28 "For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than Yoḥanan, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Elohim is greater than he."
\p
\v 29 When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared Elohim to be just, having been immersed with Yoḥanan's immersion.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of Elohim, not being immersed by him themselves.
\p
\v 31 "To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?
\v 32 They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call to one another, saying, 'We piped to you, and you did not dance. We mourned, and you did not weep.'
\v 33 For Yoḥanan the Immerser came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
\v 35 Wisdom is justified by all her children."
\p
\v 36 One of the Pharisees invited Him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat at the table.
\v 37 Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that He was reclining in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment.
\v 38 Standing behind at His feet weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed His feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
\v 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw it, he said to himself, "This man, if He were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches Him, that she is a sinner."
\s1 Parable of Two Debtors
\p
\v 40 ישוע answered him, "Shimon, I have something to tell you." He said, "Teacher, say on."
\p
\v 41 "A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
\v 42 When they could not pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?"
\p
\v 43 Shimon answered, "He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most." He said to him, "You have judged correctly."
\p
\v 44 Turning to the woman, He said to Shimon, "Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.
\v 45 You gave Me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet.
\v 46 You did not anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with ointment.
\v 47 Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."
\v 48 He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
\p
\v 49 Those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"
\p
\v 50 He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."
\c 8
\s1 Service of Women
\p
\v 1 Soon afterwards, He went about through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of Elohim. With Him were the twelve,
\v 2 and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Miryam who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;
\v 3 and Yoanna, the wife of Ḥuzas, Herod's steward; Shoshannah; and many others; who served them from their possessions.
\v 4 When a great crowd came together, and people from every city were coming to Him, He spoke by a parable.
\s1 Parable of the Sower
\p
\v 5 "The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the heavens devoured it.
\v 6 Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
\v 7 Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.
\v 8 Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and produced one hundred times as much fruit." As He said these things, He called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
\p
\v 9 Then His talmidim asked Him, "What does this parable mean?"
\p
\v 10 He said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Elohim, but to the rest it is given in parables; that 'seeing they may not perceive, and hearing they may not understand.'
\v 11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of Elohim.
\v 12 Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.
\v 13 Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.
\v 14 That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.
\v 15 Those in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance.
\s1 Teaching about the Lamp
\p
\v 6 "No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.
\v 17 For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light.
\v 18 Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has."
\p
\v 19 His mother and brothers came to Him, and they could not come near Him for the crowd.
\v 20 Some people told Him, "Your mother and Your brothers stand outside, desiring to see You."
\p
\v 21 But He answered them, "My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of Elohim, and do it."
\s1 Calming of the Storm
\p
\v 22 Now on one of those days, He entered into a boat, Himself and His talmidim, and He said to them, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake." So they launched out.
\v 23 But as they sailed, He fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.
\v 24 They came to Him, and awoke Him, saying, "Master, master, we are dying!" He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.
\v 25 He said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being afraid they marveled, saying to one another, "Who is this then, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?"
\v 26 They arrived at the country of the Girgashites, which is opposite the Galil.
\s1 Demons Cast Out into Swine
\p
\v 27 When ישוע stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met Him. He wore no clothes, and did not live in a house, but in the tombs.
\v 28 When he saw ישוע, he cried out, and fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have to do with You, ישוע, You Son of El Elyon? I beg You, do not torment me!"
\v 29 For ישוע was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was guarded, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the wildernesses.
\p
\v 30 ישוע asked him, "What is your name?" He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.
\v 31 They begged Him that He would not command them to go into the abyss.
\v 32 Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain, and they begged Him that He would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.
\v 33 The demons came out of the man, and entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.
\v 34 When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
\p
\v 35 People went out to see what had happened. They came to ישוע, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at ישוע' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
\v 36 Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was saved.
\v 37 All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.
\v 38 But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged Him that he might go with Him, but ישוע sent him away, saying,
\v 39 "Return to your house, and declare what great things Elohim has done for you." He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things ישוע had done for him.
\s1 Miracles of Healing
\p
\v 40 When ישוע returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.
\v 41 Behold, there came a man named Yair, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at ישוע's feet, and begged Him to come into his house,
\v 42 for he had an only begotten daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds pressed against Him.
\v 43 A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, [who had spent all her living on physicians,] and could not be healed by any,
\v 44 came behind Him, and touched the tsitsit of His cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.
\p
\v 45 ישוע said, "Who touched Me?" When all denied it, Kepha and those with him said, "Master, the crowds press and jostle You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'"
\p
\v 46 But ישוע said, "Someone did touch Me, for I perceived that power has gone out of Me."
\v 47 When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before Him declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she was healed immediately.
\v 48 He said to her, "Daughter, take courage. Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."
\p
\v 49 While He still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue's house came, saying to him, "Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Teacher."
\p
\v 50 But ישוע hearing it, answered him, "Do not be afraid. Only believe, and she will be saved."
\v 51 When He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter in, except Kepha, Yoḥanan, Ya'aqov, the father of the child, and her mother.
\v 52 All were weeping and mourning her, but He said, "Do not weep. She is not dead, but sleeping."
\p
\v 53 They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.
\v 54 But He put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, He called, saying, "Child, arise!"
\v 55 Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.
\v 56 Her parents were amazed, but He commanded them to tell no one what had been done.
\c 9
\s1 Authority of the Twelve
\p
\v 1 He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
\v 2 He sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of Elohim and to heal the sick.
\v 3 He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats each.
\v 4 Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.
\v 5 As many as do not receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a witness against them."
\p
\v 6 They departed, and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the good news, and healing everywhere.
\v 7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that Yoḥanan had risen from the dead,
\v 8 and by some that Eliyahu had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
\v 9 Herod said, "Yoḥanan I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?" He sought to see Him.
\p
\v 10 The sheliḥim, when they had returned, told Him what things they had done. He took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Beth-tsaida.
\v 11 But the crowds, perceiving it, followed Him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of Elohim, and He cured those who needed healing.
\v 12 The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to Him, "Send the crowd away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a wilderness region."
\s1 Feeding Five Thousand
\p
\v 13 But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people."
\v 14 For they were about five thousand men. He said to His talmidim, "Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
\v 15 They did so, and made them all sit down.
\p
\v 16 He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the heavens, He blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the talmidim to set before the crowd.
\v 17 They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.
\p
\v 18 As he was praying alone, the talmidim were with Him, and He asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
\v 19 They answered, "'Yoḥanan the Immerser,' but others say, 'Eliyahu,' and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again."
\p
\v 20 He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Kepha answered, "The Messiah of Elohim."
\p
\v 21 But He warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,
\v 22 saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up."
\p
\v 23 He said to all, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his stake daily, and follow Me.
\v 24 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for My sake, the same will save it.
\v 25 For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?
\v 26 For whoever will be ashamed of Me and of My words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when He comes in His glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the set-apart messengers.
\v 27 But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of Elohim."
\s1 Vision of Transformation
\p
\v 28 About eight days after these sayings, He took with Him Kepha, Yoḥanan, and Ya'aqov, and went up onto the mountain to pray.
\v 29 As He was praying, the appearance of His face was altered, and His clothing became white and dazzling.
\v 30 Behold, two men were talking with Him, who were Mosheh and Eliyahu,
\v 31 who appeared in glory, and spoke of His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 32 Now Kepha and those who were with Him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory, and the two men who stood with Him.
\v 33 As they were parting from Him, Kepha said to ישוע, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents: one for You, and one for Mosheh, and one for Eliyahu," not knowing what he said.
\p
\v 34 While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.
\v 35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My Son, My Chosen One. Listen to Him!"
\v 36 When the voice came, ישוע was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
\p
\v 37 On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met Him.
\v 38 Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, "Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only begotten child.
\v 39 Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.
\v 40 I begged your talmidim to cast it out, and they could not."
\p
\v 41 ישוע answered, "Unfaithful and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."
\p
\v 42 While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But ישוע rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
\v 43 They were all astonished at the majesty of Elohim. But while all were marveling at all the things which ישוע did, He said to his talmidim,
\v 44 "Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men."
\v 45 But they did not understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.
\s1 Test of Greatness
\p
\v 46 There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.
\v 47 ישוע, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by His side,
\v 48 and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in My Name receives Me. Whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great."
\p
\v 49 Yoḥanan answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your Name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us."
\v 50 ישוע said to him, "Do not forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us."
\p
\v 51 It came to be, when the days were near for His ascension, He intently set His face to go to Yerushalayim,
\v 52 and sent messengers before His face. They went, and entered into a village of the Shomeronites, so as to prepare for Him.
\v 53 They did not receive Him, because He was traveling with His face set towards Yerushalayim.
\v 54 When His talmidim, Ya'aqov and Yoḥanan, saw this, they said, "Master, do You want us to command fire to come down from the heavens, and destroy them?"
\p
\v 55 But He turned and rebuked them, [and said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are;
\v 56 for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them."] And they went to another village.
\v 57 As they went on the way, a certain man said to Him, "I want to follow You wherever You go, Master."
\s1 Cost of Following ישוע
\p
\v 58 ישוע said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heavens have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head."
\v 59 He said to another, "Follow Me!" But he said, "Master, allow me first to go and bury my father."
\v 60 But ישוע said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of Elohim."
\v 61 Another also said, "I want to follow You, Master, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house."
\v 62 But ישוע said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of Elohim."
\c 10
\s1 Seventy[-Two] Sent Out
\p
\v 1 Now after these things, the Master also appointed seventy-two others, and sent them two by two ahead of Him into every city and place, where He was about to come.
\v 2 Then He said to them, "The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Master of the harvest, that He may send out laborers into His harvest.
\v 3 Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.
\v 4 Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way.
\v 5 Into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'
\v 6 If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.
\v 7 Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.
\v 8 Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.
\v 9 Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, 'The Kingdom of Elohim has come near to you.'
\v 10 But into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,
\v 11 'Even the dust from your city that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this: the Kingdom of Elohim has come near to you.'
\v 12 I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sedom than for that city.
\p
\v 13 "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Beth-tsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tsor and Tsidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 14 But it will be more tolerable for Tsor and Tsidon in the judgment than for you.
\v 15 You, Kaphar-naḥum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down to Sheol.
\v 16 Whoever listens to you listens to Me, and whoever rejects you rejects Me. Whoever rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me."
\s1 The Seventy[-Two] Return with Joy
\p
\v 17 The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, "Master, even the demons are subject to us in Your Name!"
\p
\v 18 He said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.
\v 19 Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you.
\v 20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens."
\p
\v 21 In that same hour ישוע rejoiced in the Set-apart Ruaḥ, and said, "I thank You, O Father, Master of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in Your eyes."
\p
\v 22 "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal Him."
\p
\v 23 Turning to the talmidim, He said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,
\v 24 for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them."
\p
\v 25 Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?"
\p
\v 26 He said to him, "What is written in the Torah? How do you read it?"
\p
\v 27 He answered, "You shall love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart, with all your being, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."
\p
\v 28 He said to him, "You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live."
\p
\v 29 But he, desiring to justify himself, asked ישוע, "Who is my neighbor?"
\s1 The Good Shomeronite
\p
\v 30 ישוע answered, "A certain man was going down from Yerushalayim to Yeriḥo, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
\v 31 By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
\v 32 In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
\v 33 But a certain Shomeronite, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw, he was moved with compassion,
\v 34 came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
\v 35 On the next day he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'
\v 36 Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?"
\p
\v 37 He said, "He who showed loving-kindness to him." Then ישוע said to him, "Go and do likewise."
\s1 Martha and Miryam
\p
\v 38 As they went on their way, He entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received Him.
\v 39 She had a sister called Miryam, who also sat at the feet of ישוע, and heard His word.
\v 40 But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to Him, and said, "Master, do you not care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me."
\p
\v 41 ישוע answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,
\v 42 but one thing is needed. Miryam has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her."
\p
\c 11
\s1 Teaching about Prayer
\p
\v 1 When He finished praying in a certain place, one of His talmidim said to Him, "Master, teach us to pray, just as Yoḥanan also taught his talmidim."
\p
\v 2 He said to them, "When you pray, say, '[Our] Father [in the heavens], may Your Name be kept set-apart. May Your Kingdom come. [May Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.]
\v 3 "'Give us each day our daily bread.
\v 4 Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. Bring us not into temptation, [but deliver us from the evil one].'"
\p
\v 5 He said to them, "Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
\v 6 for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,'
\v 7 and he from within will answer and say, 'Do not bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give it to you'?
\v 8 I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.
\p
\v 9 "I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.
\v 10 For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
\p
\v 11 "Which of you fathers, if your son asks for [bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for] a fish, he will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?
\v 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
\v 13 If you then, being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Set-apart Ruaḥ to those who ask Him?"
\s1 A House Divided
\p
\v 14 He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds marveled.
\v 15 But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."
\v 16 Others, testing Him, sought from him a sign from heaven.
\v 17 But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.
\v 18 If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
\v 19 But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.
\v 20 But if I by the finger of Elohim cast out demons, then the Kingdom of Elohim has come to you.
\p
\v 21 "When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.
\v 22 But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he believed, and divides his plunder.
\p
\v 23 "He that is not with Me is against Me. He who does not gather with Me scatters.
\v 24 The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, 'I will turn back to my house from which I came out.'
\v 25 When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.
\v 26 Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first."
\p
\v 27 It came about, as He said these things, a certain woman out of the crowd lifted up her voice, and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!"
\p
\v 28 But He said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of Elohim, and guard it."
\s1 The Sign of Yonah
\p
\v 29 When the crowds were gathering together to him, He began to say, "This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Yonah [the prophet].
\v 30 For even as Yonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.
\v 31 The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shelomoh; and behold, one greater than Shelomoh is here.
\v 32 The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the proclaiming of Yonah, and behold, one greater than Yonah is here.
\p
\v 33 "No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.
\v 34 The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.
\v 35 Therefore see whether the light that is in you is not darkness.
\v 36 If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light."
\s1 Woes to the Pharisees
\p
\v 37 Now as He spoke, a Pharisee asked Him to dine with Him. He went in, and sat at the table.
\v 38 When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that He had not first washed Himself before dinner.
\v 39 The Master said to him, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
\v 40 You foolish ones, did He who made the outside not make the inside also?
\v 41 But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.
\v 42 But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of Elohim. You should have done these, and not neglected the other.
\v 43 Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.
\v 44 Woe to you, [scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!] For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them do not know it."
\p
\v 45 One of the lawyers answered Him, "Teacher, in saying this you insult us also."
\p
\v 46 He said, "Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves will not even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.
\v 47 Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
\v 48 So you are witnesses and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.
\v 49 Therefore also the wisdom of Elohim said, 'I will send to them prophets and sheliḥim; and some of them they will kill and persecute,
\v 50 that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
\v 51 from the blood of Havel to the blood of Zekharyah, who perished between the altar and the set-apart place.' Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
\v 52 Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered."
\p
\v 53 As He went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of Him;
\v 54 lying in wait for Him, and seeking to catch Him in something He might say, that they might accuse Him.
\c 12
\s1 Leaven of the Pharisees
\p
\v 1 Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, He began to tell His talmidim first of all, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
\v 2 But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.
\v 3 Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.
\s1 Fear Elohim
\p
\v 4 "I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
\v 5 But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear Him, who after He has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear Him.
\p
\v 6 "Are five sparrows not sold for two cents? Not one of them is forgotten by Elohim.
\v 7 But the very hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore do not be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
\p
\v 8 "I tell you, everyone who confesses Me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the messengers of Elohim;
\v 9 but he who denies Me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the messengers of Elohim.
\v 10 Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Set-apart Ruaḥ will not be forgiven.
\v 11 When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;
\v 12 for the Set-apart Ruaḥ will teach you in that same hour what you must say."
\p
\v 13 One of the people of the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
\p
\v 14 But He said to him, "Man, who made Me a judge or a divider over you?"
\v 15 He said to them, "Beware! Guard yourselves against all covetousness, for a man's life does not consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses."
\s1 Parable of the Rich Fool
\p
\v 16 He spoke a parable to them, saying, "The ground of a certain rich man produced abundantly.
\v 17 He reasoned within himself, saying, 'What will I do, because I do not have room to store my crops?'
\v 18 He said, 'This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all the grain and my goods.
\v 19 I will tell my being, "Being, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry."'
\p
\v 20 "But Elohim said to him, 'You foolish one, tonight your being is required of you. The things which you have prepared—whose will they be?'
\v 21 So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward Elohim."
\s1 Teaching about Worry
\p
\v 22 He said to His talmidim, "Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.
\v 23 Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
\v 24 Consider the ravens: they do not sow, they do not reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and Elohim feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!
\v 25 Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?
\v 26 If then you are not able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?
\v 27 Consider the lilies, how they grow. They do not toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Shelomoh in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
\v 28 But if this is how Elohim clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith?
\v 29 Do not seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.
\v 30 For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.
\v 31 But seek His Kingdom, and these things will be added to you.
\v 32 Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.
\v 33 Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\s1 Be Ready for Service
\p
\v 35 "Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning.
\v 36 Be like men watching for their master, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.
\v 37 Blessed are those bondservants, whom the master will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.
\v 38 They will be blessed whether he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.
\v 39 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have [watched, and] not allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 40 Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you do not expect him."
\p
\v 41 Kepha said to Him, "Master, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?"
\p
\v 42 The Master said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?
\v 43 Blessed is that bondservant whom his master will find doing so when he comes.
\v 44 Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.
\v 45 But if that bondservant says in his heart, 'My master delays his coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,
\v 46 then the master of that bondservant will come in a day when he is not expecting him, and in an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.
\v 47 That bondservant, who knew his master's will, and did not prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,
\v 48 but he who did not know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.
\s1 Not Peace, but Divison
\p
\v 49 "I came to throw fire on the earth. I desire that it were already kindled.
\v 50 But I have an immersion to be immersed with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!
\v 51 Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.
\v 52 For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
\v 53 They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."
\p
\v 54 He said to the crowds also, "When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.
\v 55 When a south wind blows, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens.
\v 56 You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the heavens, but how is it that you do not interpret this time?
\v 57 Why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?
\v 58 For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
\v 59 I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny."
\c 13
\s1 Call to Repent
\p
\v 1 Now there were some present at the same time who told Him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
\v 2 ישוע answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered these things?
\v 3 I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.
\v 4 Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Shiloaḥ fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Yerushalayim?
\v 5 I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way."
\p
\v 6 He spoke this parable. "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.
\v 7 He said to the vine dresser, 'Behold, these three years now I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?'
\v 8 He answered, 'Master, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.
\v 9 If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.'"
\s1 Healing on the Sabbath
\p
\v 10 He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.
\v 11 Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up.
\v 12 When ישוע saw her, He called her, and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity."
\v 13 He laid His hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified Elohim.
\p
\v 14 The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because ישוע had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, "There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!"
\p
\v 15 Therefore the Master answered him, "You hypocrites! Does each one of you not free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water?
\v 16 Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Avraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?"
\p
\v 17 As He said these things, all His adversaries were disappointed, and all the crowd rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.
\s1 Parable of the Mustard Seed; Parable of Leaven
\p
\v 18 He said, "What is the Kingdom of Elohim like? To what shall I compare it?
\v 19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a tree, and the birds of the heavens live in its branches."
\p
\v 20 Again He said, "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of Elohim?
\v 21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."
\s1 Teaching in Villages
\p
\v 22 He went on His way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Yerushalayim.
\v 23 One said to Him, "Master, are they few who are saved?" He said to them,
\v 24 "Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.
\v 25 When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, 'Master, open to us!' then he will answer and tell you, 'I do not know you or where you come from.'
\v 26 Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'
\v 27 He will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of lawlessness.'
\v 28 There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Avraham, Yitsḥaq, Ya'aqov, and all the prophets, in the Kingdom of Elohim, and yourselves being thrown outside.
\v 29 They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of Elohim.
\v 30 Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last."
\p
\v 31 In that same hour some Pharisees came, saying to Him, "Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill You."
\p
\v 32 He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow, and the third day I will be perfected.
\v 33 Nevertheless I must go on My way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside of Yerushalayim.'
\p
\v 34 "Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!
\v 35 Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see Me, until you say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the Name of יהוה!'"
\c 14
\s1 Healing on the Sabbath
\p
\v 1 When He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching Him.
\v 2 Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of Him.
\v 3 ישוע, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?"
\p
\v 4 But they were silent. He took him, and healed him, and let him go.
\v 5 He answered them, "Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, would not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?"
\p
\v 6 They could not answer Him regarding these things.
\s1 Parable of the Wedding Feast
\p
\v 7 He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when He noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,
\v 8 "When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,
\v 9 and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, 'Make room for this person.' Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.
\v 10 But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored before all who sit at the table with you.
\v 11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
\p
\v 12 He also said to the one who had invited Him, "When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back.
\v 13 But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;
\v 14 and you will be blessed, because they do not have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous."
\p
\v 15 When one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, "Blessed is he who will eat bread in the Kingdom of Elohim!"
\s1 Parable of the Supper
\p
\v 16 But He said to him, "A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.
\v 17 He sent out his bondservant at supper time to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'
\v 18 They all as one began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.'
\v 19 Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.'
\v 20 Another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'
\v 21 That bondservant came, and told his master these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his bondservant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.'
\p
\v 22 "The bondservant said, 'Master, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.'
\p
\v 23 "The master said to the bondservant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
\v 24 For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.'"
\p
\v 25 Now great crowds were going with him. He turned and said to them,
\v 26 "If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My talmid.
\v 27 Whoever does not bear his own stake, and come after Me, cannot be My talmid.
\v 28 For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?
\v 29 Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,
\v 30 saying, 'This man began to build, and was not able to finish.'
\v 31 Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
\v 32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.
\v 33 So therefore whoever of you who does not renounce all that he has, he cannot be My talmid.
\v 34 Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?
\v 35 It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
\p
\c 15
\s1 Lost Sheep
\p
\v 1 Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to Him to hear Him.
\v 2 The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, "This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them."
\p
\v 3 He told them this parable:
\v 4 "Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?
\v 5 When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
\v 6 When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'
\v 7 "I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.
\s1 Lost Coin
\p
\v 8 "Or what woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma coin, would not light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?
\v 9 When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.'
\v 10 Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the messengers of Elohim over one sinner repenting."
\s1 Prodigal Son
\p
\v 11 He said, "A certain man had two sons.
\v 12 The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of your property.' He divided his livelihood between them.
\v 13 Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living.
\v 14 When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.
\v 15 He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
\v 16 He wanted to be satisfied from the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.
\v 17 But when he came to himself he said, 'How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare, and I am dying with hunger!
\v 18 I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your eyes.
\v 19 I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants."'
\p
\v 20 "He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
\v 21 The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your eyes. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
\p
\v 22 "But the father said to his bondservants, 'Quickly, bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.
\v 23 Bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let us eat, and celebrate;
\v 24 for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.' They began to celebrate.
\p
\v 25 "Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
\v 26 He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.
\v 27 He said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.'
\v 28 But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.
\v 29 But he answered his father, 'Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a command of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.
\v 30 But when your son came, who has devoured your living with whores, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.'
\p
\v 31 "He said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
\v 32 But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and lived. He was lost, and is found.'"
\c 16
\s1 The Unrighteous Steward
\p
\v 1 He also said to His talmidim, "There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions.
\v 2 He called him, and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'
\p
\v 3 "The manager said within himself, 'What will I do, seeing that my master is taking away the management position from me? I do not have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.
\v 4 I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.'
\v 5 Calling each one of his master's debtors to him, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my master?'
\v 6 He said, 'A hundred baths of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
\v 7 Then he said to another, 'How much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred cors of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'
\p
\v 8 "His master commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this age are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.
\v 9 I tell you, make for yourselves friends from means of unrighteous mammon, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the everlasting tents.
\v 10 He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.
\v 11 If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you the true riches?
\v 12 If you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?
\v 13 No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You are not able to serve Elohim and mammon."
\p
\v 14 The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at Him.
\v 15 He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but Elohim knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of Elohim.
\v 16 The Torah and the prophets were until Yoḥanan. From that time the good news of the Kingdom of Elohim is proclaimed, and everyone is forcing his way into it.
\v 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one stroke of a pen in the Torah to fall.
\v 18 Everyone who sends away his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is sent away from a husband commits adultery.
\s1 Elazar and the Rich Man
\p
\v 19 "Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.
\v 20 A certain beggar, named Elazar, was taken to his gate, full of sores,
\v 21 and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
\v 22 The beggar died, and he was carried away by the messengers to Avraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried.
\v 23 In Sheol, he lifted up his eyes, being in trial, and saw Avraham far off, and Elazar at his bosom.
\v 24 He cried and said, 'Father Avraham, be kind to me, and send Elazar, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.'
\p
\v 25 "But Avraham said, 'Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Elazar, in the same way, bad things. But here he is now comforted, and you are in anguish.
\v 26 Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that no one may cross over from there to us.'
\p
\v 27 "He said, 'I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house;
\v 28 for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they will not also come into this place of torment.'
\p
\v 29 "But Avraham said to him, 'They have Mosheh and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'
\p
\v 30 "He said, 'No, father Avraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
\p
\v 31 "He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Mosheh and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.'"
\c 17
\s1 Teachings about Forgiveness, Faith
\p
\v 1 He said to the talmidim, "It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!
\v 2 It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
\v 3 Be careful. If your brother sins [against you], rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.
\v 4 If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him."
\p
\v 5 The sheliḥim said to the Master, "Increase our faith."
\p
\v 6 The Master said, "If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.
\v 7 But who is there among you, having a bondservant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down at the table,'
\v 8 and will not rather tell him, 'Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink'?
\v 9 Does he thank that bondservant because he did the things that were commanded?
\v 10 Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy bondservants. We have done our duty.'"
\s1 Ten Lepers Cleansed
\p
\v 11 As He was on His way to Yerushalayim, He was passing along the borders of Shom'ron and the Galil.
\v 12 As He entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met Him, who stood at a distance.
\v 13 They lifted up their voices, saying, "ישוע, Master, be kind to us!"
\p
\v 14 When He saw them, He said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." As they went, they were cleansed.
\v 15 One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying Elohim with a loud voice.
\v 16 He fell on his face at the feet of ישוע, giving Him thanks; and he was a Shomeronite.
\v 17 ישוע answered, "Were not the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?
\v 18 Were there none found who returned to give glory to Elohim, except this stranger?"
\v 19 Then He said to him, "Get up, and go your way. Your faith has saved you."
\p
\v 20 Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of Elohim would come, He answered them, "The Kingdom of Elohim does not come with observation;
\v 21 neither will they say, 'Look, here!' or, 'there!' for behold, the Kingdom of Elohim is within you."
\s1 Return of the Son of Man
\p
\v 22 He said to the talmidim, "The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
\v 23 They will tell you, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Do not go away, nor follow after them,
\v 24 for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the heavens, shines to the other part under the heavens; so will the Son of Man be in His day.
\v 25 But first, He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
\v 26 As it was in the days of Noaḥ, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.
\v 27 They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noaḥ entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
\v 28 Likewise, even as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
\v 29 but in the day that Lot went out from Sedom, it rained fire and sulfur from the heavens, and destroyed them all.
\v 30 It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
\v 31 In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.
\v 32 Remember Lot's wife!
\v 33 Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.
\v 34 I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.
\v 35 There will be two women grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left.
\v 36 [Two men will be in the field; one will be taken, the other will be left."]
\p
\v 37 They, answering, asked him, "Where, Master?" He said to them, "Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together."
\c 18
\s1 Parables on Prayer
\p
\v 1 He also spoke a parable to them that it is necessary for them to always pray, and not give up,
\v 2 saying, "There was a judge in a certain city who did not fear Elohim, and did not respect man.
\v 3 A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'
\v 4 He would not for a while, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear Elohim, nor respect man,
\v 5 yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.'"
\p
\v 6 The Master said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
\v 7 Will not Elohim avenge His chosen ones, who are crying out to Him day and night, and yet He exercises patience with them?
\v 8 I tell you that He will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?"
\s1 The Pharisee and the Tax Collector
\p
\v 9 He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.
\v 10 Two men went up into the Temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.
\v 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: 'Elohim, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
\v 12 I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.'
\v 13 But the tax collector, standing far away, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'Elohim, be kind to me, a sinner!'
\v 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."
\p
\v 15 They were also bringing their babies to Him, that He might touch them. But when the talmidim saw it, they rebuked them.
\v 16 ישוע summoned them, saying, "Allow the little children to come to me, and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of Elohim belongs to such as these.
\v 17 Most certainly, I tell you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of Elohim like a little child, he will in no way enter into it."
\p
\s1 Rich Ruler
\v 18 A certain ruler asked Him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?"
\p
\v 19 ישוע asked him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one—Elohim.
\v 20 You know the commands: 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not murder,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false witness,' 'Honor your father and your mother.'"
\p
\v 21 He said, "I have guarded all these things from my youth up."
\p
\v 22 When ישוע heard, He said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me."
\p
\v 23 But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.
\p
\v 24 ישוע, seeing that he became very sad, said, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of Elohim!
\v 25 For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Elohim."
\p
\v 26 Those who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"
\v 27 But He said, "The things which are impossible with men are possible with Elohim."
\p
\v 28 Kepha said, "Look, we have left all our possessions, and followed You."
\p
\v 29 He said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the Kingdom of Elohim,
\v 30 who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come, everlasting life."
\p
\v 31 He took the twelve aside, and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Yerushalayim, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed.
\v 32 For He will be delivered up to the nations, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.
\v 33 They will scourge and kill Him. On the third day, He will rise again."
\p
\v 34 They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not understand the things that were said.
\s1 Blind Man Healed
\p
\v 35 As He came near Yeriḥo, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.
\v 36 Hearing a crowd going by, he asked what this meant.
\v 37 They told him that ישוע of Nazareth was passing by.
\v 38 He cried out, "ישוע, You son of David, be kind to me!"
\v 39 Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, "You son of David, be kind to me!"
\p
\v 40 Standing still, ישוע commanded him to be brought to Him. When he had come near, He asked him,
\v 41 "What do you want Me to do?" He said, "Master, that I may see again."
\p
\v 42 ישוע said to him, "Receive your sight. Your faith has saved you."
\v 43 Immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying Elohim. All the people, when they saw it, praised Elohim.
\c 19
\s1 Zakai the Tax Collector
\p
\v 1 He entered and was passing through Yeriḥo.
\v 2 There was a man named Zakai. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.
\v 3 He was trying to see who ישוע was, and could not because of the crowd, because he was short.
\v 4 He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way.
\v 5 When ישוע came to the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zakai, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house."
\v 6 He hurried, came down, and received Him joyfully.
\v 7 When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, "He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner."
\p
\v 8 Zakai stood and said to the Master, "Behold, Master, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much."
\p
\v 9 ישוע said to him, "Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Avraham.
\v 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost."
\s1 Parable of Ten Minas
\p
\v 11 As they heard these things, He went on and told a parable, because He was near Yerushalayim, and they supposed that the Kingdom of Elohim would be revealed immediately.
\v 12 He said therefore, "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
\v 13 He called ten bondservants of his, and gave them ten mina coins, and told them, 'Conduct business until I come.'
\v 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'
\p
\v 15 "When he had come back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded these bondservants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.
\v 16 The first came before him, saying, 'Master, your mina has made ten more minas.'
\p
\v 17 "He said to him, 'Well done, you good bondservant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'
\p
\v 18 "The second came, saying, 'Your mina, Master, has made five minas.'
\p
\v 19 "So he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.'
\v 20 Another came, saying, 'Master, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,
\v 21 for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.'
\p
\v 22 "He said to him, 'Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you evil bondservant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow.
\v 23 Then why did you not deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?'
\v 24 He said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.'
\p
\v 25 "They said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas!'
\v 26 'For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away.
\v 27 But bring those enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.'"
\s1 Entering Yerushalayim
\p
\v 28 Having said these things, He went on ahead, going up to Yerushalayim.
\v 29 When He came near to Beth-phag and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, He sent two of his talmidim,
\v 30 saying, "Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, which no man had ever sat upon. Untie it, and bring it.
\v 31 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say to him: 'The Master needs it.'"
\p
\v 32 Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them.
\v 33 As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
\v 34 They said, "The Master needs it."
\v 35 They brought it to ישוע. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set ישוע on them.
\v 36 As he went, they spread their cloaks on the road.
\v 37 As He was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the talmidim began to rejoice and praise Elohim with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,
\v 38 saying, "Blessed is the King who comes in the Name of יהוה! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!"
\p
\v 39 Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, rebuke Your talmidim!"
\p
\v 40 He answered them, "I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out."
\s1 Weeping for Yerushalayim
\p
\v 41 When He came near, He saw the city and wept over it,
\v 42 saying, "If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are hidden from your eyes.
\v 43 For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,
\v 44 and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you did not know the time of your visitation."
\s1 Driving the Money Changers out of the Temple
\p
\v 45 He entered into the Temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,
\v 46 saying to them, "It is written, 'My house will be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of robbers!'"
\p
\v 47 He was teaching daily in the Temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy Him.
\v 48 They could not find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that He said.
\c 20
\s1 Authority of ישוע Questioned
\p
\v 1 On one of those days, as He was teaching the people in the Temple and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and scribes came to Him with the elders.
\v 2 They asked Him, "Tell us: by what authority do You do these things? Or who is giving You this authority?"
\p
\v 3 He answered them, "I also will ask you one question. Tell me:
\v 4 the immersion of Yoḥanan, was it from heaven, or from men?"
\p
\v 5 They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'
\v 6 But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that Yoḥanan was a prophet."
\v 7 They answered that they did not know where it was from.
\p
\v 8 ישוע said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
\s1 Parable of the Vineyard
\p
\v 9 He began to tell the people this parable. "A man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.
\v 10 At the proper season, he sent a bondservant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.
\v 11 He sent yet another bondservant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
\v 12 He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out.
\v 13 The master of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that they will respect him.'
\p
\v 14 "But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'
\v 15 They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the master of the vineyard do to them?
\v 16 He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others." When they heard it, they said, "May it never be!"
\p
\v 17 But He looked at them, and said, "Then what is this that is written, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief cornerstone?'
\v 18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust."
\s1 Render to Caesar the things of Caesar
\p
\v 19 The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him that very hour, but they feared the people—for they knew He had spoken this parable against them.
\v 20 They watched Him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap Him in something He said, so as to deliver Him up to the power and authority of the governor.
\v 21 They asked Him, "Teacher, we know that You say and teach what is right, and You are not partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of Elohim.
\v 22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
\p
\v 23 But He perceived their craftiness, and said to them, "[Why do you test Me?]
\v 24 Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?" They answered, "Caesar's."
\v 25 He said to them, "Then give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to Elohim the things of Elohim."
\p
\v 26 And they were not able to seize Him in His words before the people. They marveled at His answer, and were silent.
\s1 Sadducees Question the Resurrection
\p
\v 27 Some of the Sadducees came to Him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.
\v 28 They asked Him, "Teacher, Mosheh wrote to us that if a man's brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed for his brother.
\v 29 There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.
\v 30 The second [took her as wife, and he died childless.]
\v 31 And the third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.
\v 32 Afterward the woman also died.
\v 33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as a wife."
\p
\v 34 ישוע said to them, "The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.
\v 35 But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
\v 36 For they cannot die any more, for they are like the messengers, and are children of Elohim, being children of the resurrection.
\v 37 But that the dead are raised, even Mosheh showed at the bush, when he called יהוה 'The Elohim of Avraham, the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya'aqov.'
\v 38 Now He is not the Elohim of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to Him."
\p
\v 39 Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, You speak well."
\v 40 They did not dare to ask Him any more questions.
\s1 Whose Son is Messiah?
\p
\v 41 He said to them, "Why do they say that the Messiah is David's son?
\v 42 David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'יהוה said to my Master, "Sit at My right hand,
\v 43 until I make Your enemies the footstool of Your feet."'
\v 44 David therefore calls Him Master, so how is He his son?"
\s1 Beware of the Scribes
\p
\v 45 In the hearing of all the people, He said to His talmidim,
\v 46 "Beware of those scribes who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at Feasts;
\v 47 who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater judgment."
\c 21
\s1 Widow's Copper Coins
\p
\v 1 He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury.
\v 2 He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small copper coins.
\v 3 He said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,
\v 4 for all these put in gifts [for Elohim] from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on."
\p
\v 5 As some were talking about the Temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, He said,
\v 6 "As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down."
\p
\v 7 They asked Him, "Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?"
\p
\v 8 He said, "Watch out that you do not get led astray, for many will come in My Name, saying, 'I am,' and, 'The time is at hand.' Therefore do not follow them.
\v 9 When you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately."
\s1 Things to Come
\p
\v 10 Then He said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
\v 11 There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.
\v 12 But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for My Name's sake.
\v 13 It will turn out as a witness for you.
\v 14 Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,
\v 15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.
\v 16 You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death.
\v 17 You will be hated by all men for My Name's sake.
\v 18 And not a hair of your head will perish.
\p
\v 19 "By your endurance you will win your lives.
\p
\v 20 "But when you see Yerushalayim surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.
\v 21 Then let those who are in Yehudah flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the middle of her depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein.
\v 22 For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
\v 23 Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people.
\v 24 They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Yerushalayim will be trampled down by the nations, until the times of the nations are fulfilled.
\s1 Return of the Son of Man
\p
\v 25 There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;
\v 26 men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
\v 27 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
\v 28 But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near."
\p
\v 29 He told them a parable. "See the fig tree, and all the trees.
\v 30 When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.
\v 31 Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of Elohim is near.
\v 32 Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all are accomplished.
\v 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.
\p
\v 34 "So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly.
\v 35 For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.
\v 36 Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man."
\p
\v 37 Every day ישוע was teaching in the Temple, and every night He would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet.
\v 38 All the people came early in the morning to Him in the Temple to hear Him.
\c 22
\s1 Plot to Kill ישוע
\p
\v 1 Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Pesaḥ, was approaching.
\v 2 The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Him to death, for they feared the people.
\v 3 Satan entered into Yehudah, who was also called Ish-Qerioth, who was counted with the twelve.
\v 4 He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver Him to them.
\v 5 They were glad, and agreed to give him money.
\v 6 He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver Him to them in the absence of the crowd.
\s1 Last Supper
\p
\v 7 The Day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Pesaḥ must be slaughtered.
\v 8 He sent Kepha and Yoḥanan, saying, "Having gone, prepare the Pesaḥ for us, that we might eat."
\p
\v 9 They said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare?"
\p
\v 10 He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.
\v 11 Tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room, in which I might eat the Pesaḥ with My talmidim?"'
\v 12 He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there."
\p
\v 13 They went, found things as He had told them, and they prepared the Pesaḥ.
\v 14 When the hour had come, He reclined with His sheliḥim.
\v 15 He said to them, "With desire I have desired to eat this Pesaḥ with you before I suffer,
\v 16 for I tell you, I will by no means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of Elohim."
\v 17 He received a cup, and when He had given thanks, He said, "Take this, and share it among yourselves,
\v 18 for I tell you, I will not drink from now on from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of Elohim comes."
\p
\v 19 He took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke, and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me."
\v 20 Likewise, He took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the renewed covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.
\v 21 But behold, the hand of him who betrays Me is with Me on the table.
\v 22 The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom He is betrayed!"
\p
\v 23 They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
\s1 Who is Greatest
\p
\v 24 There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
\v 25 He said to them, "The kings of the nations hold it over them, and those who have authority over them are called 'benefactors.'
\v 26 But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.
\v 27 For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.
\v 28 But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.
\v 29 I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on Me,
\v 30 that you may eat and drink at My table in My Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Yisra'el."
\p
\v 31 [The Master said], "Shimon, Shimon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat,
\v 32 but I prayed for you, that your faith would not fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers."
\p
\v 33 He said to Him, "Master, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death!"
\p
\v 34 He said, "I tell you, Kepha, a rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know Me three times."
\p
\v 35 He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing."
\p
\v 36 Then He said to them, "But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, must sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
\v 37 For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in Me: 'He was numbered with the lawless.' For that which concerns Me has an end."
\p
\v 38 They said, "Master, behold, here are two swords." He said to them, "That is enough."
\s1 Prayer in the Garden
\p
\v 39 He came out, and went, as His custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His talmidim also followed Him.
\v 40 When He was at the place, He said to them, "Pray that you do not enter into temptation."
\p
\v 41 He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and prayed,
\v 42 saying, "Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Nevertheless, not My will, but Yours, be done."
\p
\v 43 A messenger from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.
\v 44 Being in agony He prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.]
\p
\v 45 When He rose up from His prayer, He came to the talmidim, and found them sleeping because of grief,
\v 46 and said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."
\s1 Betrayal and Arrest
\p
\v 47 While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd, and He who was called Yehudah, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to ישוע to kiss Him.
\v 48 But ישוע said to him, "Yehudah, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"
\p
\v 49 When those who were around Him saw what was about to happen, they said to Him, "Master, shall we strike with the sword?"
\v 50 A certain one of them struck the bondservant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
\p
\v 51 But ישוע answered, "Permit this much"—and He touched his ear, and healed him.
\v 52 ישוע said to the chief priests, captains of the Temple, and elders, who had come against Him, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
\v 53 When I was with you in the Temple daily, you did not stretch out your hands against Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
\s1 Kepha's Denial
\p
\v 54 They seized Him, and led Him away, and brought Him into the high priest's house. But Kepha followed from a distance.
\v 55 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Kepha sat among them.
\v 56 A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, "This man also was with Him."
\p
\v 57 He denied ישוע, saying, "Woman, I do not know Him."
\p
\v 58 After a little while someone else saw him, and said, "You also are one of them!" But Kepha answered, "Man, I am not!"
\p
\v 59 After about one hour passed, another confidently insisted, saying, "Truly this man also was with Him, for he is a Galilean!"
\p
\v 60 But Kepha said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about!" Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
\v 61 The Master turned, and looked at Kepha. Then Kepha remembered the Master's word, how He said to him, "Before the rooster crows today you will deny Me three times."
\v 62 He went out, and wept bitterly.
\p
\v 63 The men who held ישוע mocked Him and beat Him.
\v 64 Having blindfolded Him, they [struck Him on the face and] asked Him, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?"
\v 65 They spoke many other things against Him, insulting Him.
\s1 ישוע Before the Sanhedrin
\p
\v 66 As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Him away into their Sanhedrin, saying,
\v 67 "If You are the Messiah, tell us." But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe,
\v 68 and if I ask, you will in no way answer Me or let Me go.
\v 69 But from now on the Son of Man will be sitting at the right hand of the power of Elohim."
\p
\v 70 They all said, "Are you then the Son of Elohim?" He said to them, "You say that I am."
\v 71 They said, "Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from His own mouth!"
\c 23
\s1 ישוע Before Pilate
\p
\v 1 The whole company of them rose up and brought Him before Pilate.
\v 2 They began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Messiah, a king."
\p
\v 3 Pilate asked Him, "Are you the King of the Yehudim?" He answered him, "So you say."
\v 4 Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."
\v 5 But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Yehudah, beginning from the Galil even to this place."
\v 6 But when Pilate heard [the Galil mentioned], he asked if the man was a Galilean.
\v 7 When he found out that He was in Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Yerushalayim during those days.
\s1 ישוע Before Herod
\p
\v 8 Now when Herod saw ישוע, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him. He hoped to see some miracle done by Him.
\v 9 He questioned him with many words, but He gave no answers.
\v 10 The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing Him.
\v 11 Herod with his soldiers humiliated Him and mocked Him. Dressing Him in luxurious clothing, they sent Him back to Pilate.
\v 12 Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.
\s1 Pilate Seeks to Release ישוע
\p
\v 13 Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
\v 14 and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined Him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse Him.
\v 15 Neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.
\v 16 I will therefore chastise Him and release Him."
\p
\v 17 Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the Feast.]
\v 18 But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this man! Release to us Bar-Abba!"—
\v 19 one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
\p
\v 20 Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release ישוע,
\v 21 but they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify Him!"
\p
\v 22 He said to them the third time, "Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and release Him."
\v 23 But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that He might be crucified. Their voices [and the voices of the chief priests] prevailed.
\v 24 Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.
\v 25 He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered ישוע up to their will.
\s1 Shimon Carries the Stake
\p
\v 26 When they led him away, they grabbed one Shimon of Kurene, coming from the country, and laid on him the stake, to carry it after ישוע.
\v 27 A great multitude of the people followed Him, including women who also mourned and lamented Him.
\v 28 But ישוע, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Yerushalayim, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
\v 29 For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
\v 30 Then they will begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover us.'
\v 31 For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?"
\p
\v 32 There were also others, two criminals, led with Him to be put to death.
\s1 ישוע Crucified
\p
\v 33 When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
\v 34 [ישוע said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."] Dividing His garments among them, they cast lots.
\v 35 The people stood watching. The rulers also scoffed at Him, saying, "He saved others. Let Him save Himself, if this is the Messiah of Elohim, His chosen one!"
\p
\v 36 The soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him and offering Him vinegar,
\v 37 and saying, "If You are the King of the Yehudim, save Yourself!"
\v 38 An inscription was also written over Him [in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew]: "This is the King of the Yehudim."
\p
\v 39 One of the criminals who was hanged insulted Him, saying, "You are the Messiah, are You not? Save Yourself and us!"
\v 40 But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Do you not even fear Elohim, seeing you are under the same judgment?
\v 41 And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."
\v 42 He said, "ישוע, remember me when You come into Your Kingdom."
\v 43 He said to him, "Assuredly I tell you today, you will be with Me in Paradise."
\p
\v 44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
\v 45 The sun's light failed, and the veil of the dwelling place was torn in two.
\v 46 ישוע, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit!" Having said this, He breathed His last.
\v 47 When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified Elohim, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man."
\v 48 All the crowds that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.
\v 49 All His acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from the Galil, stood at a distance, watching these things.
\s1 Burial of ישוע
\p
\v 50 Behold, a man named Yoseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man
\v 51 (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Ramah, a city of the Yehudim, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of Elohim:
\v 52 this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of ישוע.
\v 53 He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.
\v 54 It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.
\v 55 The women, who had come with Him out of the Galil, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how His body was laid.
\v 56 They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the command.
\c 24
\s1 The Resurrection
\p
\v 1 But on day one of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
\v 2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
\v 3 They entered in, and did not find the body of Master ישוע.
\v 4 While they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.
\v 5 Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. They said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
\v 6 He is not here, but is risen. Remember what He told you when He was still in the Galil,
\v 7 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?"
\v 8 They remembered His words,
\v 9 returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
\v 10 Now they were Miryam from Magdala, Yoanna, and Miryam the mother of Ya'aqov. The other women with them told these things to the sheliḥim.
\v 11 These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they did not believe them.
\v 12 But Kepha got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen by themselves, and he departed by himself, wondering what had happened.
\s1 Road to Emmaus
\p
\v 13 Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Yerushalayim.
\v 14 They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.
\v 15 While they talked and questioned together, ישוע Himself came near, and went with them.
\v 16 But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.
\v 17 He said to them, "What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?"
\v 18 One of them, named Kleopas, answered Him, "Are you the only stranger in Yerushalayim who does not know the things which have happened there in these days?"
\v 19 He said to them, "What things?" They said to him, "The things concerning ישוע, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before Elohim and all the people;
\v 20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to the judgment of death, and crucified Him.
\v 21 But we were hoping that it was He who would redeem Yisra'el. Yes, and besides all this, this brings the third day since these things happened.
\v 22 Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;
\v 23 and when they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of messengers, who said that He was alive.
\v 24 Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they did not see Him."
\v 25 He said to them, "Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
\v 26 Did the Messiah not have to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?"
\v 27 Beginning from Mosheh and from all the prophets, He explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.
\v 28 They came near to the village, where they were going, and He acted like He would go further.
\v 29 They urged Him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is almost over." He went in to stay with them.
\v 30 When He had sat down at the table with them, He took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, He gave it to them.
\v 31 Their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him, and He vanished out of their sight.
\v 32 They said to one another, "Were our hearts not burning within us, while He spoke to us along the way, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?"
\v 33 They rose up that very hour, returned to Yerushalayim, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
\v 34 saying, "The Master is risen indeed, and has appeared to Shimon!"
\v 35 They related the things that happened along the way, and how He was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
\s1 Other Appearances
\p
\v 36 As they said these things, ישוע Himself stood among them, and said to them, "Peace be to you."
\v 37 But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
\v 38 He said to them, "Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?
\v 39 See My hands and My feet, that it is truly Me. Touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have." [
\v 40 When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.]
\v 41 While they still could not believe it for their joy, and wondered, He said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
\p
\v 42 They gave him a piece of a broiled fish [and some honeycomb].
\v 43 He took them, and ate in front of them.
\v 44 He said to them, "This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the Torah of Mosheh, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning Me must be fulfilled."
\v 45 Then He opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.
\v 46 He said to them, "Thus it is written, for the Messiah to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
\v 47 and that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His Name to all the nations, beginning at Yerushalayim.
\v 48 You are witnesses of these things.
\v 49 Behold, I send out the promise of My Father on you. But wait in the city of Yerushalayim until you are clothed with power from on high."
\p
\v 50 He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands, and blessed them.
\v 51 While He blessed them, He withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.
\v 52 And they, having bowed down to Him, returned to Yerushalayim with great joy,
\v 53 and were continually in the Temple, blessing Elohim.
