\v 1 Shelomoh the son of David was firmly established in his kingdom, and יהוה his Elohim was with him, and made him exceedingly great.
\v 2 Shelomoh spoke to all Yisra'el, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every prince in all Yisra'el, the heads of the fathers' households.
\v 3 So Shelomoh, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Givon; for the Tent of Appointment of Elohim was there, which Mosheh the servant of יהוה had made in the wilderness.
\v 4 But David had brought the ark of Elohim up from Qiryath Yearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Yerushalayim.
\v 5 Moreover the copper altar that Betsal'el the son of Uri, the son of Ḥur, had made was there before the Tabernacle of יהוה; and Shelomoh and the assembly were seeking counsel there.
\v 6 Shelomoh went up there to the copper altar before יהוה, which was at the Tent of Appointment, and offered one thousand ascension offerings on it.
\p
\v 7 That night, Elohim appeared to Shelomoh and said to him, "Ask for what you want Me to give you."
\p
\v 8 Shelomoh said to Elohim, "You have shown great loving-kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place.
\v 9 Now, יהוה Elohim, let Your promise to David my father be faithful; for You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
\v 10 Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?"
\p
\v 11 Elohim said to Shelomoh, "Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor yet have you asked for long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people, over whom I have made you king,
\v 12 therefore wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you had, and none after you will have."
\p
\v 13 So Shelomoh came from the high place that was at Givon, from before the Tent of Appointment, to Yerushalayim; and he reigned over Yisra'el.
\p
\v 14 Shelomoh gathered chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Yerushalayim.
\v 15 The king made silver and gold to be as common as stones in Yerushalayim, and he made cedars to be as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.
\v 16 The horses which Shelomoh had were brought out of Mitsrayim and from Que. The king's merchants purchased them from Que.
\v 17 They brought up and brought out of Mitsrayim a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty. They also exported them to the Ḥittite kings and the Aramean kings.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now Shelomoh decided to build a house for the Name of יהוה, and a house for his kingdom.
\v 2 Shelomoh counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.
\v 3 Shelomoh sent to Ḥuram the king of Tsor, saying, "As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me.
\v 4 Behold, I am about to build a house for the Name of יהוה my Elohim, to dedicate it to Him, to burn before Him incense of sweet spices, for the continual show bread, and for the ascension offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set Feasts of יהוה our Elohim. This is an ordinance forever to Yisra'el.
\p
\v 5 "The house which I am building will be great; for our Elohim is greater than all elohim.
\v 6 But who is able to build Him a house, since the heavens and the heaven of the heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I then, that I should build Him a house, except just to burn incense before Him?
\v 7 Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, in silver, in copper, in iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Yehudah and in Yerushalayim, whom David my father provided.
\v 8 Send me also cedar trees, cypress trees, and algum trees out of Levanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Levanon. Behold, my servants will be with your servants,
\v 9 even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful.
\v 10 Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand cors of beaten wheat, twenty thousand baths of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
\p
\v 11 Then Ḥuram the king of Tsor answered in writing, which he sent to Shelomoh, "Because יהוה loves His people, He has made you king over them."
\v 12 Ḥuram continued, "Blessed be יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, who made the heavens and the earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who would build a house for יהוה, and a house for his kingdom.
\v 13 Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, of Ḥuram my father's,
\v 14 the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tsor, skillful to work in gold, in silver, in copper, in iron, in stone, in timber, and in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving and to devise any device; that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my master David your father.
\v 15 Now therefore the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my master has spoken of, let him send to his servants;
\v 16 and we will cut wood out of Levanon, as much as you need. We will bring it to you in floats by sea to Yapho; and you shall carry it up to Yerushalayim."
\p
\v 17 Shelomoh counted all the sojourners of the men who were in the land of Yisra'el, after the numbering with which David his father had counted them; and they found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.
\v 18 He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to assign the people their work.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Then Shelomoh began to build the house of יהוה at Yerushalayim on Mount Moriah, where יהוה appeared to David his father, which he prepared in the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Yevusite.
\v 2 He began to build in the second day of the second new moon, in the fourth year of his reign.
\v 3 Now these are the foundations which Shelomoh laid for the building of the house of Elohim. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits.
\v 4 The porch that was in front, its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
\v 5 He made the larger room with a ceiling of cypress wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains.
\v 6 He decorated the house with precious stones for beauty. The gold was gold from Parvaim.
\v 7 He also overlaid the house, the beams, the thresholds, its walls, and its doors with gold; and engraved keruvim on the walls.
\p
\v 8 He made the most set-apart place. Its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
\v 9 The weight of the nails was fifty sheqels of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms with gold.
\p
\v 10 In the most set-apart place he made two keruvim by carving; and they overlaid them with gold.
\v 11 The wings of the keruvim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other keruv.
\v 12 The wing of the other keruv was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other keruv.
\v 13 The wings of these keruvim spread themselves out twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
\v 14 He made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with keruvim.
\p
\v 15 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits height, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
\v 16 He made chains in the inner set-apart place, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
\v 17 He set up the pillars before the Temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Yakin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then he made an altar of copper, twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high.
\v 2 Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim. It was round, five cubits high, and thirty cubits in circumference.
\v 3 Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
\v 4 It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward.
\v 5 It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths.
\v 6 He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them. The things that belonged to the ascension offering were washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
\p
\v 7 He made the ten menorot of gold according to the judgment concerning them; and he set them in the Temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
\v 8 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the Temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. He made one hundred basins of gold.
\v 9 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with copper.
\v 10 He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
\p
\v 11 Ḥuram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Ḥuram finished doing the work that he did for King Shelomoh in the house of Elohim:
\v 12 the two pillars, the bowls, the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,
\v 13 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.
\v 14 He also made the bases, and he made the basins on the bases;
\v 15 one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.
\v 16 Ḥuram his father also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for King Shelomoh, for the house of יהוה, of bright copper.
\v 17 The king cast them in the plain of the Yarden, in the clay ground between Sukkoth and Tseredah.
\v 18 Thus Shelomoh made all these vessels in great abundance; for the weight of the copper could not be determined.
\p
\v 19 Shelomoh made all the vessels that were in the house of Elohim, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them;
\v 20 and the menorot with their lamps, to burn according to the judgment before the inner set-apart place, of pure gold;
\v 21 and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold that was perfect gold;
\v 22 and the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans of pure gold. As for the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most set-apart place and the doors of the main hall of the Temple were of gold.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Thus all the work that Shelomoh did for the house of יהוה was finished. Shelomoh brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Elohim.
\p
\v 2 Then Shelomoh assembled the elders of Yisra'el, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' households of the children of Yisra'el, to Yerushalayim, to bring up the ark of the covenant of יהוה out of the city of David, which is Tsion.
\v 3 So all the men of Yisra'el assembled themselves to the king at the Feast, which was in the seventh new moon.
\v 4 All the elders of Yisra'el came. The Levites took up the ark;
\v 5 and they brought up the ark, the Tent of Appointment, and all the set-apart vessels that were in the Tent; these the priests the Levites brought up.
\v 6 King Shelomoh and all the congregation of Yisra'el, who were assembled to him, were before the ark, slaughtering sheep and cattle that could not be counted or counted for multitude.
\v 7 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of יהוה to its place, into the inner set-apart place of the house, to the most set-apart place, even under the wings of the keruvim.
\v 8 For the keruvim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the keruvim covered the ark and its poles above.
\v 9 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark in front of the inner set-apart place; but they were not seen outside; and it is there to this day.
\v 10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Mosheh put at Ḥorev, when יהוה cut a covenant with the children of Yisra'el, when they came out of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 11 When the priests had come out of the set-apart place (for all the priests who were present had set themselves apart, and did not guard their divisions;
\v 12 also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Yeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets);
\v 13 when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking יהוה; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised יהוה, saying, "For He is good; for His loving-kindness endures for ever!" then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of יהוה,
\v 14 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of יהוה filled the house of Elohim.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Then Shelomoh said, "יהוה has said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.
\v 2 But I have built You a house and home, a place for You to dwell in forever."
\p
\v 3 The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Yisra'el: and all the assembly of Yisra'el stood.
\v 4 He said, "Blessed be יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, who spoke with His mouth to David my father, and has with His hands fulfilled it, saying,
\v 5 'Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Mitsrayim, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Yisra'el to build a house in, that My Name might be there and I chose no man to be prince over My people Yisra'el;
\v 6 but now I have chosen Yerushalayim, that My Name might be there; and I have chosen David to be over My people Yisra'el.'
\v 7 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the Name of יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 8 But יהוה said to David my father, 'Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for My Name, you did well that it was in your heart;
\v 9 nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who will come out of your loins, he shall build the house for My Name.'
\p
\v 10 "יהוה has performed His word that He spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Yisra'el, as יהוה promised, and have built the house for the Name of יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 11 There I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of יהוה, which He cut with the children of Yisra'el."
\p
\v 12 He stood before the altar of יהוה in the presence of all the assembly of Yisra'el, and spread out his hands
\v 13 (for Shelomoh had made a copper basin, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court; and he stood on it, and knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Yisra'el, and spread out his hands toward the heavens)
\v 14 and he said, "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, there is no Elohim like You in heavens or on earth; You who guard covenant and loving-kindness with Your servants who walk before You with all their heart;
\v 15 who have guarded with Your servant David my father that which You promised him. Yes, You spoke with Your mouth, and have fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is today.
\p
\v 16 "Now therefore, יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, guard with Your servant David my father that which You have promised him, saying, 'There shall not be cut off from you a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Yisra'el, if only your children guard their way, to walk in My Torot as you have walked before Me.'
\v 17 Now therefore, יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, let Your word be faithful, which You spoke to Your servant David.
\v 18 But will Elohim indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heaven of the heavens cannot contain You; how much less this house which I have built!?
\v 19 Yet have respect for the prayer of Your servant, and to his petition, יהוה my Elohim, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant prays before You;
\v 20 that Your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place where You have said that You would put Your Name; to listen to the prayer which Your servant will pray toward this place.
\v 21 Listen to the petitions of Your servant, and of Your people Yisra'el, when they pray toward this place. Yes, hear from Your dwelling place, even from the heavens; and when You hear, forgive.
\p
\v 22 "If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before Your altar in this house;
\v 23 then hear from the heavens, act, and judge Your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his way on his own head; and declaring the righteous right, to give him according to his righteousness.
\p
\v 24 "If Your people Yisra'el are struck down before the enemy because they have sinned against You, and they turn again and confess Your Name, and pray and make petition before You in this house;
\v 25 then hear from the heavens, and forgive the sin of Your people Yisra'el, and bring them again to the land which You gave to them and to their fathers.
\v 26 When the heavens are closed up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You; if they pray toward this place, and confess Your Name, and turn from their sin, when You afflict them;
\v 27 then hear in the heavens, and forgive the sin of Your servants of Your people Yisra'el, when You teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on Your land, which You have given to Your people for an inheritance.
\p
\v 28 "If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is;
\v 29 whatever prayer and petition is made by any man, or by all Your people Yisra'el, who will each know his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread out his hands toward this house;
\v 30 then hear from the heavens Your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You, even You only, know the hearts of the children of men)
\v 31 that they may fear You, to walk in Your ways, so long as they live in the land which You gave to our fathers.
\p
\v 32 "Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of Your people Yisra'el, when he comes from a far country for Your great Name's sake, and Your mighty hand, and Your outstretched Arm; when they come and pray toward this house;
\v 33 then hear from the heavens, even from Your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to You for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Your Name and fear You, as do Your people Yisra'el, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your Name.
\p
\v 34 "If Your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way You send them, and they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your Name;
\v 35 then hear from the heavens their prayer and their petition, and maintain their judgment.
\v 36 If they sin against You (for there is no man who does not sin), and You are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near;
\v 37 yet if they come to their senses in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make petition to You in the land of their captivity, saying, 'We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;'
\v 38 if they return to You with all their heart and with all their being in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which You gave to their fathers, and the city which You have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Your Name;
\v 39 then hear from the heavens, even from Your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their judgment, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You.
\p
\v 40 "Now, my Elohim, let, I beg You, let Your eyes be open, and let Your ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.
\v 41 Now therefore arise, יהוה Elohim, into Your resting place, You, and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests, יהוה Elohim, be clothed with salvation, and let Your set-apart ones rejoice in goodness.
\v 42 יהוה Elohim, do not turn away the face of Your anointed. Remember Your loving-kindnesses to David Your servant."
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Now when Shelomoh had finished praying, fire came down from the heavens and consumed the ascension offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of יהוה filled the house.
\v 2 The priests could not enter into the house of יהוה, because the glory of יהוה filled the house of יהוה.
\v 3 All the children of Yisra'el looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of יהוה was on the house. They bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, bowed down, and gave thanks to יהוה, saying, "For He is good; for His loving-kindness endures forever."
\p
\v 4 Then the king and all the people slaughtered sacrifices before יהוה.
\v 5 King Shelomoh slaughtered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of Elohim.
\v 6 The priests stood, according to their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of יהוה, which David the king had made to give thanks to יהוה, when David praised by their ministry, saying "For His loving-kindness endures for ever." The priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Yisra'el stood.
\p
\v 7 Moreover Shelomoh made the middle of the court that was before the house of יהוה set-apart; for there he offered the ascension offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the copper altar which Shelomoh had made was not able to receive the ascension offering, the meal offering, and the fat.
\p
\v 8 So Shelomoh held the Feast at that time for seven days, and all Yisra'el with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Ḥamath to the wadi of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 9 On the Eighth Day, they held a solemn assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the Feast seven days.
\v 10 On the twenty-third day of the seventh new moon, he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that יהוה had shown to David, and to Shelomoh, and to Yisra'el His people.
\p
\v 11 Thus Shelomoh finished the house of יהוה and the king's house; and he successfully completed all that came into Shelomoh's heart to make in the house of יהוה and in his own house.
\v 12 יהוה appeared to Shelomoh by night, and said to him, "I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself for a house of sacrifice.
\p
\v 13 "If I close up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people;
\v 14 if My people, who are called by My Name, will humble themselves, pray, seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways; then I will hear from the heavens, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
\v 15 Now My eyes will be open My ears attentive to prayer that is made in this place.
\v 16 For now I have chosen and made this house set-apart, that My Name may be there forever; and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually.
\p
\v 17 "As for you, if you will walk before Me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will guard My statutes and My judgments;
\v 18 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according to how I cut a covenant with David your father, saying, 'There shall not be cut off from you a man to be ruler in Yisra'el.'
\p
\v 19 "But if you turn away, and forsake My statutes and My commands which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other elohim, and bow down to them;
\v 20 then I will pluck them up by the roots out of My land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made set-apart for My Name, I will cast out of My sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
\v 21 This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, 'Why has יהוה done this to this land and to this house?'
\v 22 They shall answer, 'Because they abandoned יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim, and took other elohim, bowed down to them, and served them. Therefore He has brought all this evil on them.'"
\c 8
\p
\v 1 At the end of twenty years, in which Shelomoh had built the house of יהוה and his own house,
\v 2 Shelomoh built the cities which Ḥuram had given to Shelomoh, and caused the children of Yisra'el to dwell there.
\p
\v 3 Shelomoh went to Ḥamath-Tsovah, and prevailed against it.
\v 4 He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Ḥamath.
\v 5 Also he built Beth Ḥoron the upper and Beth Ḥoron the lower, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
\v 6 and Ba'alath, and all the storage cities that Shelomoh had, and all the cities for his chariots, the cities for his horsemen, and all that Shelomoh desired to build for his pleasure in Yerushalayim, in Levanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\p
\v 7 As for all the people who were left of the Ḥittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Ḥivites, and the Yevusites, who were not of Yisra'el;
\v 8 of their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Yisra'el did not finish off, of them Shelomoh conscripted forced labor to this day.
\v 9 But of the children of Yisra'el, Shelomoh made no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
\v 10 These were the chief officers of King Shelomoh, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.
\p
\v 11 Shelomoh brought up Pharaoh's daughter out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her; for he said, "My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Yisra'el, because the places where the ark of יהוה has come to are set-apart."
\p
\v 12 Then Shelomoh offered ascension offerings to יהוה on the altar of יהוה, which he had built in front of the porch,
\v 13 even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the command of Mosheh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set Feasts, three times per year, during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, during the Feast of Weeks, and during the Feast of Sukkot.
\v 14 He appointed, according to the judgment of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate, for David the man of Elohim had so commanded.
\v 15 They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
\p
\v 16 Now all the work of Shelomoh was prepared from the day of the foundation of the house of יהוה until it was finished. So the house of יהוה was completed.
\p
\v 17 Then Shelomoh went to Etsion Gever and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.
\v 18 Ḥuram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Shelomoh to Ophir, and brought from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought them to King Shelomoh.

\v 1 When the queen of Sheva heard of the fame of Shelomoh, she came to test Shelomoh with hard questions at Yerushalayim, with a very great caravan, including camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. When she had come to Shelomoh, she talked with him about all that was in her heart.
\v 2 Shelomoh answered all her questions. There was not anything hidden from Shelomoh which he did not tell her.
\v 3 When the queen of Sheva had seen the wisdom of Shelomoh, the house that he had built,
\v 4 the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers, their clothing, his cup bearers also, their clothing, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of יהוה; there was no more spirit in her.
\p
\v 5 She said to the king, "It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom.
\v 6 However I did not believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed the fame that I heard!
\v 7 Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom.
\v 8 Blessed be יהוה your Elohim, who delighted in you, to set you on his throne, to be king for יהוה your Elohim; because your Elohim loved Yisra'el, to establish them forever. Therefore He made you king over them, to do judgment and righteousness."
\p
\v 9 She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones. There was never before such spice as the queen of Sheva gave to King Shelomoh.
\v 10 The servants of Ḥuram and the servants of Shelomoh, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones.
\v 11 The king used algum tree wood to make terraces for the house of יהוה and for the king's house, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers. There were none like these seen before in the land of Yehudah.
\v 12 King Shelomoh gave to the queen of Sheva all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
\p
\v 13 Now the weight of gold that came to Shelomoh in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
\v 14 besides that which the traders and merchants brought. All the kings of Aravia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Shelomoh.
\v 15 King Shelomoh made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold. Six hundred sheqels of beaten gold went to one buckler.
\v 16 He made three hundred shields of beaten gold. Three hundred sheqels of gold went to one shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Levanon.
\v 17 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
\v 18 There were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and armrests on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests.
\v 19 Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps. There was nothing like it made in any other kingdom.
\v 20 All King Shelomoh's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Levanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in the days of Shelomoh.
\v 21 For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with Ḥuram's servants. Once every three years, the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
\p
\v 22 So King Shelomoh exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
\v 23 All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Shelomoh, to hear his wisdom, which Elohim had put in his heart.
\v 24 They each brought tribute, vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armor, spices, horses, and mules every year.
\v 25 Shelomoh had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Yerushalayim.
\v 26 He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Mitsrayim.
\v 27 The king made silver as common in Yerushalayim as stones, and he made cedars to be as abundant as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.
\v 28 They brought horses for Shelomoh out of Mitsrayim and out of all lands.
\p
\v 29 Now the rest of the acts of Shelomoh, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Aḥiyah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Yarovam the son of Nevat?
\v 30 Shelomoh reigned in Yerushalayim over all Yisra'el forty years.
\v 31 Shelomoh slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of his father David: and Reḥavam his son reigned in his place.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Reḥavam went to Shekhem; for all Yisra'el had come to Shekhem to make him king.
\v 2 When Yarovam the son of Nevat heard of it (for he was in Mitsrayim, where he had fled from the presence of King Shelomoh), Yarovam returned out of Mitsrayim.
\v 3 They sent and called him; and Yarovam and all Yisra'el came, and they spoke to Reḥavam, saying,
\v 4 "Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you."
\p
\v 5 He said to them, "Come again to me after three days." So the people departed.
\v 6 King Reḥavam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Shelomoh his father while he yet lived, saying, "What counsel do you give me about how to answer these people?"
\p
\v 7 They spoke to him, saying, "If you are kind to these people, please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever."
\p
\v 8 But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.
\v 9 He said to them, "What counsel do you give, that we may give an answer to these people, who have spoken to me, saying, 'Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?'"
\p
\v 10 The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, "Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;' thus you shall say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
\v 11 Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will do so with scorpions.'"
\p
\v 12 So Yarovam and all the people came to Reḥavam the third day, as the king asked, saying, "Come to me again the third day."
\v 13 The king answered them roughly; and King Reḥavam abandoned the counsel of the old men,
\v 14 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will do so with scorpions."
\p
\v 15 So the king did not listen to the people; for it was brought about by Elohim, that יהוה might establish His word, which He spoke by Aḥiyah the Shilonite to Yarovam the son of Nevat.
\v 16 When all Yisra'el saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, "What portion have we in David? We do not have an inheritance in the son of Yishai! Every man to your tents, Yisra'el! Now see to your own house, David." So all Yisra'el departed to their tents.
\v 17 But as for the children of Yisra'el who lived in the cities of Yehudah, Reḥavam reigned over them.
\v 18 Then King Reḥavam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Yisra'el stoned him to death with stones. King Reḥavam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Yerushalayim.
\v 19 So Yisra'el rebelled against David's house to this day.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 When Reḥavam had come to Yerushalayim, he assembled the house of Yehudah and Benyamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Yisra'el, to bring the kingdom again to Reḥavam.
\v 2 But the word of יהוה came to Shemayahu the man of Elohim, saying,
\v 3 "Speak to Reḥavam the son of Shelomoh, king of Yehudah, and to all Yisra'el in Yehudah and Benyamin, saying,
\v 4 'יהוה says, "You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers! Every man return to his house; for this thing is of Me."'" So they listened to the words of יהוה, and returned from going against Yarovam.
\p
\v 5 Reḥavam lived in Yerushalayim, and built cities for defense in Yehudah.
\v 6 He built Beth-leḥem, Etam, Teqoa,
\v 7 Beth-Tsur, Soko, Adullam,
\v 8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
\v 9 Adoraim, Lakish, Azeqah,
\v 10 Tsorah, Aiyalon, and Ḥevron, which are fortified cities in Yehudah and in Benyamin.
\v 11 He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, oil and wine.
\v 12 He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceedingly strong. Yehudah and Benyamin belonged to him.
\p
\v 13 The priests and the Levites who were in all Yisra'el stood with him out of all their territory.
\v 14 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Yehudah and Yerushalayim; for Yarovam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office to יהוה.
\v 15 He himself appointed priests for the high places, for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made.
\v 16 After them, out of all the tribes of Yisra'el, those who set their hearts to seek יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, came to Yerushalayim to slaughter to יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers.
\v 17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Yehudah, and made Reḥavam the son of Shelomoh strong for three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Shelomoh.
\p
\v 18 Reḥavam took a wife for himself, Maḥalath the daughter of Yerimoth the son of David and of Aviḥayil the daughter of Eliav the son of Yishai.
\v 19 She bore him sons: Yeush, Shemaryah, and Zaham.
\v 20 After her, he took Ma'akah the daughter of Avshalom; and she bore him Aviyah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
\v 21 Reḥavam loved Ma'akah the daughter of Avshalom above all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and brought forth twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
\v 22 Reḥavam appointed Aviyah the son of Ma'akah to be chief, the prince among his brothers; for he intended to make him king.
\v 23 He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Yehudah and Benyamin, to every fortified city. He gave them food in abundance and he sought many wives for them.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 When the kingdom of Reḥavam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the Torah of יהוה, and all Yisra'el with him.
\v 2 In the fifth year of King Reḥavam, Shishaq king of Mitsrayim came up against Yerushalayim – because they had trespassed against יהוה –
\v 3 with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Mitsrayim: the Luvim, the Suqqim, and the Kushites.
\v 4 He took the fortified cities which belonged to Yehudah, and came to Yerushalayim.
\v 5 Now Shemayah the prophet came to Reḥavam, and to the princes of Yehudah, who were gathered together to Yerushalayim because of Shishaq, and said to them, "יהוה says, 'You have forsaken Me, therefore I have also left you in the hand of Shishaq.'"
\p
\v 6 Then the princes of Yisra'el and the king humbled themselves; and they said, "יהוה is righteous."
\p
\v 7 When יהוה saw that they humbled themselves, the word of יהוה came to Shemayah, saying, "They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and My wrath will not be poured out on Yerushalayim by the hand of Shishaq.
\v 8 Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."
\p
\v 9 So Shishaq king of Mitsrayim came up against Yerushalayim and took away the treasures of the house of יהוה and the treasures of the king's house. He took it all away. He also took away the shields of gold which Shelomoh had made.
\v 10 King Reḥavam made shields of copper in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, the guards of the door of the king's house.
\v 11 As often as the king entered into the house of יהוה, the guard came and bore them, then brought them back into the guard room.
\v 12 When he humbled himself, the wrath of יהוה turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether. Moreover, there were good things found in Yehudah.
\p
\v 13 So King Reḥavam strengthened himself in Yerushalayim and reigned; for Reḥavam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Yerushalayim, the city which יהוה had chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra'el to put His Name there. His mother's name was Na'amah the Ammonitess.
\v 14 He did that which was evil, because he did not set his heart to seek יהוה.
\p
\v 15 Now the acts of Reḥavam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemayah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, in the genealogies? There were wars between Reḥavam and Yarovam continually.
\v 16 Reḥavam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; and Aviyah his son reigned in his place.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 In the eighteenth year of King Yarovam, Aviyah began to reign over Yehudah.
\v 2 He reigned three years in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was Mikhayah the daughter of Uri'el of Givah. There was war between Aviyah and Yarovam.
\v 3 Aviyah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Yarovam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.
\v 4 Aviyah stood up on Mount Tsemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephrayim, and said, "Hear me, Yarovam and all Yisra'el:
\v 5 Ought you not to know that יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, gave the kingdom over Yisra'el to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
\v 6 Yet Yarovam the son of Nevat, the servant of Shelomoh the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his master.
\v 7 Vain men were gathered to him, sons of Beliyya'al, who strengthened themselves against Reḥavam the son of Shelomoh, when Reḥavam was young and tender hearted, and could not withstand them.
\p
\v 8 "Now you intend to withstand the kingdom of יהוה in the hand of the sons of David. You are a great multitude, and the golden calves which Yarovam made you for elohim are with you.
\v 9 Have you not driven out the priests of יהוה, the sons of Aharon, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves according to the ways of the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to set himself apart with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of those who are no elohim.
\p
\v 10 "But as for us, יהוה is our Elohim, and we have not forsaken Him. We have priests serving יהוה, the sons of Aharon, and the Levites in their work;
\v 11 and they burn to יהוה every morning and every evening ascension offerings and sweet incense. They also set the show bread in order on the pure table; and the menorah of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening; for we guard the charge of יהוה our Elohim, but you have forsaken Him.
\v 12 Behold, Elohim is with us at our head, and His priests with the trumpets of sounding to sound an alarm against you. Children of Yisra'el, do not fight against יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers; for you will not prosper."
\p
\v 13 But Yarovam caused an ambush to come about behind them; so they were before Yehudah, and the ambush was behind them.
\v 14 When Yehudah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to יהוה, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
\v 15 Then the men of Yehudah gave a shout. As the men of Yehudah shouted, Elohim struck Yarovam and all Yisra'el before Aviyah and Yehudah.
\v 16 The children of Yisra'el fled before Yehudah, and Elohim delivered them into their hand.
\v 17 Aviyah and his people killed them with a great slaughter, so five hundred thousand chosen men of Yisra'el fell down slain.
\v 18 Thus the children of Yisra'el were brought under at that time, and the children of Yehudah prevailed, because they relied on יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers.
\v 19 Aviyah pursued Yarovam, and took cities from him, Beth-El with its villages, Yeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages.
\p
\v 20 Yarovam did not recover strength again in the days of Aviyah. יהוה struck him, and he died.
\v 21 But Aviyah grew mighty, and took for himself fourteen wives, and brought forth twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.
\v 22 The rest of the acts of Aviyah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 So Aviyah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in in city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days, the land was quiet ten years.
\v 2 Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of יהוה his Elohim;
\v 3 for he took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles,
\v 4 and commanded Yehudah to seek יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, and to obey His Torah and command.
\v 5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Yehudah the high places and the sun-pillars; and the kingdom was quiet before him.
\v 6 He built fortified cities in Yehudah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because יהוה had given him rest.
\v 7 For he said to Yehudah, "Let us build these cities, and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought יהוה our Elohim. We have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side." So they built and prospered.
\p
\v 8 Asa had an army of three hundred thousand out of Yehudah who bore bucklers and spears, and two hundred eighty thousand out of Benyamin who bore shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor.
\p
\v 9 Zerah the Kushite came out against them with an army of a million troops and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.
\v 10 Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Tsephathah at Mareshah.
\v 11 Asa cried to יהוה his Elohim, and said, "יהוה, there is no one besides You to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, יהוה our Elohim; for we rely on You, and in Your Name are we come against this multitude. יהוה, You are our Elohim. Do not let man prevail against You."
\p
\v 12 So יהוה struck the Kushites before Asa and before Yehudah; and the Kushites fled.
\v 13 Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and so many of the Kushites fell that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before יהוה and before His army; and they carried away very much spoil.
\v 14 They struck all the cities around Gerar; for the fear of יהוה came on them, and they plundered all the cities; for there was much plunder in them.
\v 15 They also struck the tents of livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Yerushalayim.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 The Ruaḥ of Elohim came on Azaryahu the son of Oded:
\v 2 and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, "Hear me, Asa, and all Yehudah and Benyamin! יהוה is with you, while you are with Him; and if you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.
\v 3 Now for a long time Yisra'el was without the true Elohim, without a teaching priest, and without Torah.
\v 4 But when in their distress they turned to יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, and sought Him, He was found by them.
\v 5 In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands.
\v 6 They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for Elohim troubled them with all adversity.
\v 7 But you be strong, and do not let your hands be slack; for your work will be rewarded."
\p
\v 8 When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he was strengthened, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Yehudah and Benyamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephrayim; and he renewed the altar of יהוה that was before the porch of יהוה.
\v 9 He gathered all Yehudah and Benyamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephrayim, Menasheh, and Shimon; for they came to him out of Yisra'el in abundance when they saw that יהוה his Elohim was with him.
\v 10 So they gathered themselves together at Yerushalayim in the third new moon, in the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.
\v 11 They slaughtered to יהוה in that day, of the plunder which they had brought, seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep.
\v 12 They entered into the covenant to seek יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their being;
\v 13 and that whoever would not seek יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
\v 14 They swore to יהוה with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with shofars.
\v 15 All Yehudah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought Him with their whole desire; and He was found by them. Then יהוה gave them rest all around.
\p
\v 16 Also Ma'akah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; so Asa cut down her image, ground it into dust, and burned it at the wadi Qidron.
\v 17 But the high places were not taken away out of Yisra'el; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
\v 18 He brought the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, gold, and vessels into the house of Elohim.
\v 19 There was no more war to the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, Ba'asha king of Yisra'el went up against Yehudah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Yehudah.
\v 2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of יהוה and of the king's house, and sent to Ben Hadad king of Aram, who lived at Dammeseq, saying,
\v 3 "Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Ba'asha king of Yisra'el, that he may depart from me."
\p
\v 4 Ben Hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Yisra'el; and they struck Iyon, Dan, Aveil Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.
\v 5 When Ba'asha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease.
\v 6 Then Asa the king took all Yehudah, and they carried away the stones of Rama, and its timber, with which Ba'asha had built; and he built Geva and Mitspah with them.
\v 7 At that time Ḥanani the seer came to Asa king of Yehudah, and said to him, "Because you have relied on the king of Aram, and have not relied on יהוה your Elohim, therefore the army of the king of Aram has escaped out of your hand.
\v 8 Were the Kushites and the Luvim not a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? Yet, because you relied on יהוה, He delivered them into your hand.
\v 9 For the eyes of יהוה run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward Him. You have done foolishly in this; for from now on you will have wars."
\p
\v 10 Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
\v 11 Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Yehudah and Yisra'el.
\v 12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa was diseased in his feet. His disease was exceedingly great: yet in his disease he did not seek יהוה, but just the physicians.
\v 13 Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the forty-first year of his reign.
\v 14 They buried him in his own tomb, which he had dug out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers' art; and they made a very great fire for him.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Yehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Yisra'el.
\v 2 He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Yehudah, and set garrisons in the land of Yehudah, and in the cities of Ephrayim, which Asa his father had taken.
\v 3 יהוה was with Yehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and did not seek the Ba'als,
\v 4 but sought to the Elohim of his father, and walked in His commands, and not in the ways of Yisra'el.
\v 5 Therefore יהוה established the kingdom in his hand. All Yehudah brought tribute to Yehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.
\v 6 His heart was lifted up in the ways of יהוה. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Yehudah.
\v 7 Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Ḥayil, Ovadyah, Zekharyah, Nethan'el, and Mikhayahu, to teach in the cities of Yehudah;
\v 8 and with them the Levites, even Shemayahu, Nethanyahu, Zevadyahu, Asah'el, Shemiramoth, Yehonathan, Adoniyahu, Toviyahu, and Tov-Adoniyah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Yehoram, the priests.
\v 9 They taught in Yehudah, having the book of the Torah of יהוה with them. They went about throughout all the cities of Yehudah and taught among the people.
\v 10 The fear of יהוה fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Yehudah, so that they made no war against Yehoshaphat.
\v 11 Some of the Philistines brought Yehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Aravians also brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.
\v 12 Yehoshaphat grew exceedingly great; and he built fortresses and store cities in Yehudah.
\v 13 He had many works in the cities of Yehudah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Yerushalayim.
\v 14 This was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses: From Yehudah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;
\v 15 and next to him Yehoḥanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;
\v 16 and next to him Amasyah the son of Zikri, who willingly offered himself to יהוה, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
\v 17 From Benyamin: Elyada, a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
\v 18 and next to him Yehozavad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready and prepared for war.
\v 19 These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Yehudah.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 Now Yehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he allied himself with Aḥav.
\v 2 After some years, he went down to Aḥav to Shom'ron. Aḥav slaughtered sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilad.
\p
\v 3 Aḥav king of Yisra'el said to Yehoshaphat king of Yehudah, "Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilad?" He answered him, "I am as you are, and my people as your people. We will be with you in the war."
\v 4 Yehoshaphat said to the king of Yisra'el, "Please inquire first for the word of יהוה."
\p
\v 5 Then the king of Yisra'el gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall we go to Ramoth Gilad to battle, or shall I forbear?" They said, "Go up; for Elohim will deliver it into the hand of the king."
\v 6 But Yehoshaphat said, "Is there not a prophet of יהוה here besides, that we may inquire of Him?"
\v 7 The king of Yisra'el said to Yehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of יהוה; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Mikhayahu the son of Yimla." Yehoshaphat said, "Do not let the king say so."
\v 8 Then the king of Yisra'el called an officer, and said, "Get Mikhayahu the son of Yimla quickly."
\v 9 Now the king of Yisra'el and Yehoshaphat the king of Yehudah each sat on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Shom'ron; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
\v 10 Tsidqiyahu the son of Kena'anah made himself horns of iron and said, "יהוה says, 'With these you shall push the Arameans, until they are consumed.'"
\p
\v 11 All the prophets prophesied so, saying, "Go up to Ramoth Gilad, and prosper; for יהוה will deliver it into the hand of the king."
\p
\v 12 The messenger who went to call Mikhayahu spoke to him, saying, "Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let your word therefore, please be like one of theirs, and speak good."
\p
\v 13 Mikhayahu said, "As יהוה lives, what my Elohim says, that will I speak."
\p
\v 14 When he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Mikhah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilad to battle, or shall I forbear?" He said, "Go up, and prosper. They shall be delivered into your hand."
\p
\v 15 The king said to him, "How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the Name of יהוה?"
\p
\v 16 He said, "I saw all Yisra'el scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. יהוה said, 'These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.'"
\p
\v 17 The king of Yisra'el said to Yehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
\p
\v 18 Mikhayahu said, "Therefore hear the word of יהוה: I saw יהוה sitting on His throne, and all the army of the heavens standing on His right hand and on His left.
\v 19 יהוה said, 'Who will entice Aḥav king of Yisra'el, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilad?' One spoke saying in this way, and another saying in that way.
\v 20 A spirit came out, stood before יהוה, and said, 'I will entice him.' "יהוה said to him, 'How?'
\v 21 "He said, 'I will go, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' "He said, 'You will entice him, and will prevail also. Go and do so.'
\p
\v 22 "Now therefore, behold, יהוה has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and יהוה has spoken evil concerning you."
\p
\v 23 Then Tsidqiyahu the son of Kena'anah came near, and struck Mikhayahu on the cheek, and said, "Which way did the Ruaḥ of יהוה go from me to speak to you?"
\p
\v 24 Mikhayahu said, "Behold, you shall see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself."
\p
\v 25 The king of Yisra'el said, "Take Mikhayahu, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Yoash the king's son;
\v 26 and say, 'Thus says the king, "Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace."'"
\p
\v 27 Mikhayahu said, "If you return at all in peace, יהוה has not spoken by me." He said, "Listen, you people, all of you!"
\p
\v 28 So the king of Yisra'el and Yehoshaphat the king of Yehudah went up to Ramoth Gilad.
\v 29 The king of Yisra'el said to Yehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes." So the king of Yisra'el disguised himself; and they went into the battle.
\v 30 Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, "Do not fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Yisra'el."
\p
\v 31 When the captains of the chariots saw Yehoshaphat, they said, "It is the king of Yisra'el!" Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Yehoshaphat cried out, and יהוה helped him; and Elohim moved them to depart from him.
\v 32 When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Yisra'el, they turned back from pursuing him.
\v 33 A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Yisra'el between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, "Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded."
\v 34 The battle increased that day. However the king of Yisra'el propped himself up in his chariot against the Arameans until the evening; and at about sunset, he died.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Yehoshaphat the king of Yehudah returned to his house in peace to Yerushalayim.
\v 2 Yehu the son of Ḥanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Yehoshaphat, "Should you help the wicked, and love those who hate יהוה? Because of this, wrath is on you from before יהוה.
\v 3 Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set your heart to seek Elohim."
\p
\v 4 Yehoshaphat lived at Yerushalayim; and he went out again among the people from Beersheva to the hill country of Ephrayim, and brought them back to יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers.
\v 5 He set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Yehudah, city by city,
\v 6 and said to the judges, "Consider what you do, for you do not judge for man, but for יהוה; and He is with you in the judgment.
\v 7 Now therefore let the fear of יהוה be on you. Guard and do it; for there is no unrighteousness with יהוה our Elohim, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes."
\p
\v 8 Moreover in Yerushalayim Yehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests, and of the heads of the fathers' households of Yisra'el, for the judgment of יהוה, and for controversies. They returned to Yerushalayim.
\v 9 He commanded them, saying, "You shall do this in the fear of יהוה, in faithfulness, and with a perfect heart.
\v 10 Whenever any controversy comes to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between Torah and command, statutes and judgments, you must warn them, that they not be guilty towards יהוה, and so wrath come on you and on your brothers. Do this, and you will not be guilty.
\v 11 Behold, Amaryahu the chief priest is over you in all matters of יהוה; and Zevadyahu the son of Yishma'el, the ruler of the house of Yehudah, in all the king's matters. Also the Levites shall be officers before you. Be strengthened, and may יהוה be with the good."
\c 20
\p
\v 1 After this, the children of Moav, the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Yehoshaphat to battle.
\v 2 Then some came who told Yehoshaphat, saying, "A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Aram. Behold, they are in Ḥatsatson-Tamar" (that is, En Gedi).
\v 3 Yehoshaphat was alarmed, and set himself to seek to יהוה. He proclaimed a fast throughout all Yehudah.
\v 4 Yehudah gathered themselves together to seek help from יהוה. They came out of all the cities of Yehudah to seek יהוה.
\p
\v 5 Yehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Yehudah and Yerushalayim, in the house of יהוה, before the new court;
\v 6 and he said, "יהוה, the Elohim of our fathers, are You not Elohim in heavens? Are You not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in Your hand, so that no one is able to withstand You.
\v 7 Did You not, our Elohim, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Yisra'el, and give it to the seed of Avraham Your friend forever?
\v 8 They lived in it, and have built You a set-apart place in it for Your Name, saying,
\v 9 'If evil comes on us—the sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this house, and before You (for Your Name is in this house), and cry to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.'
\v 10 Now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moav and Mount Seir, whom You would not let Yisra'el invade when they came out of the land of Mitsrayim, but they turned aside from them, and did not destroy them;
\v 11 behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of Your possession, which You have given us to inherit.
\v 12 Our Elohim, will You not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on You."
\p
\v 13 All Yehudah stood before יהוה, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
\p
\v 14 Then the Ruaḥ of יהוה came on Yaḥazi'el the son of Zekharyahu, the son of Benayah, the son of Yei'el, the son of Mattanyah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, in the middle of the assembly;
\v 15 and he said, "Listen, all Yehudah, and you inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and you, King Yehoshaphat. יהוה says to you, 'Do not be afraid, and do not be dismayed because of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but rather it belongs to Elohim.
\v 16 Tomorrow, go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Tsits. You will find them at the end of the wadi, before the wilderness of Yeru'el.
\v 17 You will not need to fight this battle. Set yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of יהוה with you, O Yehudah and Yerushalayim. Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed. Go out against them tomorrow, for יהוה is with you.'"
\p
\v 18 Yehoshaphat stooped his head with his face to the ground; and all Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim fell down before יהוה, bowing down to יהוה.
\v 19 The Levites, of the children of the Qohathites and of the children of the Qoraḥites, stood up to praise יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, with an exceeding loud voice.
\p
\v 20 They rose early in the morning, and went out into the wilderness of Teqoa. As they went out, Yehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, Yehudah, and you inhabitants of Yerushalayim! Trust יהוה your Elohim, so you will be trusted! Trust His prophets, so you will prosper."
\p
\v 21 When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to יהוה, and give praise in set-apart array, as they go out before the army, and say, "Give thanks to יהוה; for His loving-kindness endures for ever."
\v 22 When they began to sing and to praise, יהוה set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moav, and Mount Seir, who had come against Yehudah; and they were struck.
\v 23 For the children of Ammon and Moav stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them: and when they had finished the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy another.
\p
\v 24 When Yehudah came to the place overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.
\v 25 When Yehoshaphat and his people came to plunder the spoil, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. They plundered the spoil for three days, it was so much.
\v 26 On the fourth day, they assembled themselves in Berakah Valley, for there they blessed יהוה. Therefore the name of that place was called "Berakah Valley" to this day.
\v 27 Then they returned, every man of Yehudah and Yerushalayim, with Yehoshaphat in front of them, to go again to Yerushalayim with joy; for יהוה had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
\v 28 They came to Yerushalayim with stringed instruments, harps, and trumpets to the house of יהוה.
\v 29 The fear of Elohim was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that יהוה fought against the enemies of Yisra'el.
\v 30 So the realm of Yehoshaphat was quiet, for his Elohim gave him rest all around.
\p
\v 31 Yehoshaphat reigned over Yehudah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was Azuvah the daughter of Shilḥi.
\v 32 He walked in the way of Asa his father, and did not turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of יהוה.
\v 33 However the high places were not taken away, and the people had still not set their hearts on the Elohim of their fathers.
\v 34 Now the rest of the acts of Yehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Yehu the son of Ḥanani, which is included in the book of the kings of Yisra'el.
\v 35 After this, Yehoshaphat king of Yehudah joined himself with Aḥazyah king of Yisra'el. The same did very wickedly.
\v 36 He joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Etsion Gever.
\v 37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Yehoshaphat, saying, "Because you have joined yourself with Aḥazyahu, יהוה has destroyed your works." The ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Yehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Yehoram his son reigned in his place.
\v 2 He had brothers, the sons of Yehoshaphat: Azaryah, Yeḥi'el, Zekharyahu, Azaryahu, Mikha'el, and Shephatyahu. All these were the sons of Yehoshaphat king of Yisra'el.
\v 3 Their father gave them great gifts of silver, of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Yehudah; but he gave the kingdom to Yehoram, because he was the firstborn.
\v 4 Now when Yehoram had risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Yisra'el.
\v 5 Yehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Yerushalayim.
\v 6 He walked in the way of the kings of Yisra'el, as did Aḥav's house; for he had Aḥav's daughter as his wife. He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה.
\v 7 However יהוה would not destroy David's house, because of the covenant that He cut with David, and as He promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always.
\p
\v 8 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Yehudah, and made a king over themselves.
\v 9 Then Yehoram went there with his captains and all his chariots with him. He rose up by night and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots.
\v 10 So Edom revolted from under the hand of Yehudah to this day. Then Livnah revolted at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken יהוה, the Elohim of his fathers.
\p
\v 11 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Yehudah, and made the inhabitants of Yerushalayim whore, and led Yehudah astray.
\v 12 A letter came to him from Eliyahu the prophet, saying, "יהוה, the Elohim of David your father, says, 'Because you have not walked in the ways of Yehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Yehudah,
\v 13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Yisra'el, and have made Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim to whore like Aḥav's house did, and also have slain your brothers of your father's house, who were better than yourself,
\v 14 behold, יהוה will strike your people with a great plague, including your children, your wives, and all your posessions;
\v 15 and you will have great sickness with a disease of your guts, until your guts fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.'"
\p
\v 16 יהוה stirred up the spirit of the Philistines against Yehoram, and of the Aravians who are beside the Kushites;
\v 17 and they came up against Yehudah, broke into it, and carried away all the posessions that were found in the king's house, including his sons and his wives; so that there was no son left him, except Yehoaḥaz, the youngest of his sons.
\p
\v 18 After all this יהוה struck him in his guts with an incurable disease.
\v 19 In process of time, at the end of two years, his guts fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. His people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
\v 20 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Yerushalayim eight years. He departed without being missed; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 The inhabitants of Yerushalayim made Aḥazyahu his youngest son king in his place, because the band of men who came with the Aravians to the camp had slain all the oldest. So Aḥazyahu the son of Yehoram king of Yehudah reigned.
\v 2 Aḥazyahu was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was Athalyahu the daughter of Omri.
\v 3 He also walked in the ways of Aḥav's house, because his mother was his counselor in acting wickedly.
\v 4 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, as did Aḥav's house, for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.
\v 5 He also followed their counsel, and went with Yehoram the son of Aḥav king of Yisra'el to war against Ḥaza'el king of Aram at Ramoth Gilad, and the Arameans wounded Yoram.
\v 6 He returned to be healed in Yizre'el of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Ḥaza'el king of Aram. Azaryahu the son of Yehoram king of Yehudah went down to see Yehoram the son of Aḥav in Yizre'el, because he was sick.
\p
\v 7 Now the destruction of Aḥazyahu was of Elohim, in that he went to Yoram; for when he had come, he went out with Yehoram against Yehu the son of Nimshi, whom יהוה had anointed to cut off Aḥav's house.
\v 8 When Yehu was executing judgment on Aḥav's house, he found the princes of Yehudah and the sons of the brothers of Aḥazyahu, serving Aḥazyahu, and killed them.
\v 9 He sought Aḥazyahu, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Shom'ron), and they brought him to Yehu, and killed him; and they buried him, for they said, "He is the son of Yehoshaphat, who sought יהוה with all his heart." The house of Aḥazyahu had no power to hold the kingdom.
\p
\v 10 Now when Athalyahu the mother of Aḥazyahu saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Yehudah.
\v 11 But Yehoshabeath, the king's daughter, took Yoash the son of Aḥazyahu, and stealthily rescued him from among the king's sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Yehoshabeath, the daughter of King Yehoram, the wife of Yehoyada the priest (for she was the sister of Aḥazyahu), hid him from Athalyahu, so that she did not kill him.
\v 12 He was with them hidden in the house of Elohim six years while Athalyah reigned over the land.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 In the seventh year, Yehoyada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azaryah the son of Yeroḥam, Yishma'el the son of Yehoḥanan, Azaryahu the son of Oved, Ma'aseyah the son of Adayahu, and Elishaphat the son of Zikri, into a covenant with him.
\v 2 They went around in Yehudah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Yehudah, and the heads of fathers' households of Yisra'el, and they came to Yerushalayim.
\v 3 All the assembly cut a covenant with the king in the house of Elohim. He said to them, "Behold, the king's son must reign, as יהוה has spoken concerning the sons of David.
\v 4 This is the thing that you must do. A third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the thresholds.
\v 5 A third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation. All the people will be in the courts of the house of יהוה.
\v 6 But let no one come into the house of יהוה except the priests and those who minister of the Levites. They shall come in, for they are set-apart, but all the people shall guard the charge of יהוה.
\v 7 The Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever comes into the house, let him be slain. Be with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out."
\p
\v 8 So the Levites and all Yehudah did according to all that Yehoyada the priest commanded: and they each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Yehoyada the priest did not dismiss the shift.
\v 9 Yehoyada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been King David's, which were in the house of Elohim.
\v 10 He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, near the altar and the house, around the king.
\v 11 Then they brought out the king's son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the witness, and made him king. Yehoyada and his sons anointed him, and they said, "Long live the king!"
\p
\v 12 When Athalyahu heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of יהוה.
\v 13 Then she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king. All the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. The singers also played musical instruments, and led the singing of praise. Then Athalyahu tore her clothes, and said, "Treason! treason!"
\p
\v 14 Yehoyada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword." For the priest said, "Do not kill her in the house of יהוה."
\v 15 So they made way for her. She went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king's house; and they killed her there.
\p
\v 16 Yehoyada cut a covenant between himself, all the people, and the king, that they should be the people of יהוה.
\v 17 All the people went to the house of Ba'al, broke it down, broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Ba'al before the altars.
\v 18 Yehoyada appointed the officers of the house of יהוה under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of יהוה, to offer the ascension offerings of יהוה, as it is written in the Torah of Mosheh, with rejoicing and with singing, as David had ordered.
\v 19 He set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of יהוה, that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in.
\v 20 He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of יהוה. They came through the upper gate to the king's house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom.
\v 21 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. They had slain Athalyahu with the sword.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Yoash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was Tsivyah, of Beersheva.
\v 2 Yoash did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה all the days of Yehoyada the priest.
\v 3 Yehoyada took for him two wives, and he brought forth sons and daughters.
\p
\v 4 After this it came to heart for Yoash to restore the house of יהוה.
\v 5 He gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, "Go out to the cities of Yehudah, and gather money to repair the house of your Elohim from all Yisra'el from year to year. See that you expedite this matter." However the Levites did not do it right away.
\v 6 The king called for Yehoyada the chief, and said to him, "Why have you not required of the Levites to bring in the portion of Mosheh the servant of יהוה, and of the assembly of Yisra'el, out of Yehudah and out of Yerushalayim, for the tent of the witness?"
\v 7 For the sons of Athalyahu, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of Elohim; and they also gave all the dedicated things of the house of יהוה to the Ba'als.
\p
\v 8 So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of יהוה.
\v 9 They made a proclamation through Yehudah and Yerushalayim, to bring in for יהוה the portion that Mosheh the servant of Elohim laid on Yisra'el in the wilderness.
\v 10 All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had filled it.
\v 11 Whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
\v 12 The king and Yehoyada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of יהוה. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of יהוה, and also those who worked iron and copper to repair the house of יהוה.
\v 13 So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands. They set up the house of Elohim as it was designed, and strengthened it.
\v 14 When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Yehoyada, from which were made vessels for the house of יהוה, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, including spoons and vessels of gold and silver. They offered ascension offerings in the house of יהוה continually all the days of Yehoyada.
\p
\v 15 But Yehoyada grew old and was full of days, and he died. He was one hundred thirty years old when he died.
\v 16 They buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Yisra'el, and toward Elohim and His house.
\p
\v 17 Now after the death of Yehoyada, the princes of Yehudah came, and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them.
\v 18 They abandoned the house of יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, and served the Asherah poles and the idols, so wrath came on Yehudah and Yerushalayim for this their guiltiness.
\v 19 Yet He sent prophets to them, to bring them again to יהוה, and they testified against them; but they would not listen.
\p
\v 20 The Ruaḥ of Elohim came on Zekharyah the son of Yehoyada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them, "Thus says Elohim, 'Why do you disobey the commands of יהוה, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken יהוה, He has also forsaken you.'"
\p
\v 21 They conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the command of the king in the court of the house of יהוה.
\v 22 Thus Yoash the king did not remember the loving-kindness which Yehoyada his father had done to him, but killed his son. When he died, he said, "May יהוה look at it, and repay it."
\p
\v 23 At the end of the year, the army of the Arameans came up against him: and they came to Yehudah and Yerushalayim, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all their plunder to the king of Dammeseq.
\v 24 For the army of the Arameans came with a small company of men; and יהוה delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers. So they executed judgment on Yoash.
\p
\v 25 When they had departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Yehoyada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died. They buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.
\v 26 These are those who conspired against him: Zavad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Yehozavad the son of Shimrith the Moavitess.
\v 27 Now concerning his sons, the greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the rebuilding of the house of Elohim, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. Amatsyahu his son reigned in his place.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Amatsyahu was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was Yehoaddan, of Yerushalayim.
\v 2 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, but not with a perfect heart.
\v 3 Now when the kingdom was established to him, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king.
\v 4 But he did not put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the Torah in the book of Mosheh, as יהוה commanded, saying, "The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin."
\p
\v 5 Moreover Amatsyahu gathered Yehudah together, and ordered them according to their fathers' houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Yehudah and Benyamin. He counted them from twenty years old and upward, and found that there were three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go out to war, who could handle spear and shield.
\v 6 He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Yisra'el for one hundred talents of silver.
\v 7 A man of Elohim came to him, saying, "O king, do not let the army of Yisra'el go with you, for יהוה is not with Yisra'el, with all the children of Ephrayim.
\v 8 But if you will go, take action, and be strong for the battle. Elohim will overthrow you before the enemy; for Elohim has power to help, and to overthrow."
\p
\v 9 Amatsyahu said to the man of Elohim, "But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Yisra'el?" The man of Elohim answered, "יהוה is able to give you much more than this."
\p
\v 10 Then Amatsyahu separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephrayim, to go home again. Therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Yehudah, and they returned home in fierce anger.
\v 11 Amatsyahu took courage, and led his people out, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir.
\v 12 The children of Yehudah carried away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.
\v 13 But the men of the army whom Amatsyahu sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Yehudah, from Shom'ron even to Beth Ḥoron, and struck of them three thousand, and plundered much plunder.
\p
\v 14 Now after Amatsyahu had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the elohim of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his elohim, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.
\v 15 Therefore the anger of יהוה burned against Amatsyahu, and He sent to him a prophet, who said to him, "Why have you sought after the elohim of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?"
\p
\v 16 As he talked with him, the king said to him, "Have we made you one of the king's counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?" Then the prophet stopped, and said, "I know that Elohim has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel."
\p
\v 17 Then Amatsyahu king of Yehudah consulted his advisers, and sent to Yoash, the son of Yehoaḥaz the son of Yehu, king of Yisra'el, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."
\p
\v 18 Yoash king of Yisra'el sent to Amatsyahu king of Yehudah, saying, "The thistle that was in Levanon sent to the cedar that was in Levanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as his wife.' Then a wild animal that was in Levanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle.
\v 19 You say to yourself that you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home. Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you, and Yehudah with you?"
\p
\v 20 But Amatsyahu would not listen; for it was of Elohim, that He might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the elohim of Edom.
\v 21 So Yoash king of Yisra'el went up, and he and Amatsyahu king of Yehudah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Yehudah.
\v 22 Yehudah was defeated by Yisra'el; and they every man fled to his tent.
\p
\v 23 Yoash king of Yisra'el took Amatsyahu king of Yehudah, the son of Yoash the son of Yehoaḥaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought him to Yerushalayim, and broke down the wall of Yerushalayim from the gate of Ephrayim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\v 24 He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Elohim with Oved-Edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Shom'ron.
\p
\v 25 Amatsyahu the son of Yoash king of Yehudah lived for fifteen years after the death of Yoash son of Yehoaḥaz king of Yisra'el.
\v 26 Now the rest of the acts of Amatsyahu, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Yehudah and Yisra'el?
\v 27 Now from the time that Amatsyahu turned away from following יהוה, they made a conspiracy against him in Yerushalayim. He fled to Lakish, but they sent after him to Lakish, and killed him there.
\v 28 They brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the City of Yehudah.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 All the people of Yehudah took Uzziyahu, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amatsyahu.
\v 2 He built Eloth, and restored it to Yehudah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
\v 3 Uzziyahu was sixteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was Yekolyah, of Yerushalayim.
\v 4 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, according to all that his father Amatsyahu had done.
\v 5 He set himself to seek Elohim in the days of Zekharyahu, who had understanding in the vision of Elohim; and as long as he sought יהוה, Elohim made him prosper.
\p
\v 6 He went out and fought against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Yabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
\v 7 Elohim helped him against the Philistines, and against the Aravians who lived in Gur Ba'al, and the Meunim.
\v 8 The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziyahu. His name spread abroad even to the entrance of Mitsrayim; for he grew exceedingly strong.
\v 9 Moreover Uzziyahu built towers in Yerushalayim at the corner gate, at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
\v 10 He built towers in the wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock; in the lowland also, and in the plain. He had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields, for he loved farming.
\v 11 Moreover Uzziyah had an army of fighting men, who went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Yei'el the scribe and Ma'aseyahu the officer, under the hand of Ḥananyahu, one of the king's captains.
\v 12 The whole number of the heads of fathers' households, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand six hundred.
\v 13 Under their hand was an army, three hundred seven thousand five hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
\v 14 Uzziyahu prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.
\v 15 In Yerushalayim, he made devices, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad, because he was marvelously helped until he was strong.
\p
\v 16 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against יהוה his Elohim; for he went into the Temple of יהוה to burn incense on the altar of incense.
\v 17 Azaryahu the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of יהוה, who were valiant men.
\v 18 They resisted Uzziyahu the king, and said to him, "It is not for you, Uzziyahu, to burn incense to יהוה, but for the priests the sons of Aharon, who are set apart to burn incense. Go out of the set-apart place, for you have trespassed. It will not be for your honor from יהוה Elohim."
\p
\v 19 Then Uzziyahu was angry. He had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of יהוה, beside the altar of incense.
\v 20 Azaryahu the chief priest, and all the priests, looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there. Yes, he himself also hurried to go out, because יהוה had struck him.
\v 21 Uzziyahu the king was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of יהוה. Yotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
\v 22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziyahu, first and last, Yeshayahu the prophet, the son of Amots, wrote.
\v 23 So Uzziyahu slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, "He is a leper." Yotham his son reigned in his place.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 Yotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was Yerushah the daughter of Tsadoq.
\v 2 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, according to all that his father Uzziyahu had done. However he did not enter into the Temple of יהוה. The people still acted corruptly.
\v 3 He built the upper gate of the house of יהוה, and he built much on the wall of Ophel.
\v 4 Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Yehudah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.
\v 5 He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand cors of barley. The children of Ammon also gave that much to him in the second year, and in the third.
\v 6 So Yotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before יהוה his Elohim.
\v 7 Now the rest of the acts of Yotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Yisra'el and Yehudah.
\v 8 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim.
\v 9 Yotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Aḥaz his son reigned in his place.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 Aḥaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim. He did not do that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, like David his father,
\v 2 but he walked in the ways of the kings of Yisra'el, and also made molten images for the Ba'als.
\v 3 Moreover he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom יהוה cast out before the children of Yisra'el.
\v 4 He slaughtered and burned incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\v 5 Therefore יהוה his Elohim delivered him into the hand of the king of Aram. They struck him, and carried away from him a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Dammeseq. He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Yisra'el, who struck him with a great slaughter.
\v 6 For Peqaḥ the son of Remalyahu killed in Yehudah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men, because they had forsaken יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers.
\v 7 Zikri, a mighty man of Ephrayim, killed Ma'aseyahu the king's son, Azriqam the ruler of the house, and Elqanah who was next to the king.
\v 8 The children of Yisra'el carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and plundered much plunder from them, and brought the spoil to Shom'ron.
\v 9 But a prophet of יהוה was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army that came to Shom'ron, and said to them, "Behold, because יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, was angry with Yehudah, He has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heavens.
\v 10 Now you intend to degrade the children of Yehudah and Yerushalayim as male and female slaves for yourselves. Are there not even with you trespasses of your own against יהוה your Elohim?
\v 11 Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives that you have taken captive from your brothers, for the fierce wrath of יהוה is on you."
\v 12 Then some of the heads of the children of Ephrayim, Azaryahu the son of Yoḥanan, Berekhyahu the son of Meshillemoth, Yeḥizqiyahu the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Ḥadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,
\v 13 and said to them, "You must not bring in the captives here, for you intend that which will bring on us a trespass against יהוה, to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Yisra'el."
\p
\v 14 So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the princes and all the assembly.
\v 15 The men who have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives, and with the plunder clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them, gave them sandals, and gave them something to eat and to drink, anointed them, carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Yeriḥo, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Shom'ron.
\p
\v 16 At that time King Aḥaz sent to the kings of Ashuwr to help him.
\v 17 For again the Edomites had come and struck Yehudah, and carried away captives.
\v 18 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Yehudah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aiyalon, Gederoth, Soko with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and also Gimzo and its villages; and they lived there.
\v 19 For יהוה brought Yehudah low because of Aḥaz king of Yisra'el, because he acted without restraint in Yehudah and trespassed severely against יהוה.
\v 20 Tilgath Pilneser king of Ashuwr came to him, and gave him trouble, but did not strengthen him.
\v 21 For Aḥaz took away a portion out of the house of יהוה, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Ashuwr; but it did not help him.
\p
\v 22 In the time of his distress, he trespassed yet more against יהוה, this same King Aḥaz.
\v 23 For he slaughtered to the elohim of Dammeseq, which struck him. He said, "Because the elohim of the kings of Aram helped them, so I will slaughter to them, that they may help me." But they were the ruin of him, and of all Yisra'el.
\v 24 Aḥaz gathered together the vessels of the house of Elohim, and cut the vessels of the house of Elohim in pieces, and closed up the doors of the house of יהוה; and he made himself altars in every corner of Yerushalayim.
\v 25 In every city of Yehudah he made high places to burn incense to other elohim, and provoked יהוה, the Elohim of his fathers, to anger.
\v 26 Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Yehudah and Yisra'el.
\v 27 Aḥaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Yerushalayim, because they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Yisra'el; and Ḥizqiyahu his son reigned in his place.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Ḥizqiyahu began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was Aviyah, the daughter of Zekharyahu.
\v 2 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, according to all that David his father had done.
\v 3 In the first year of his reign, in the first new moon, he opened the doors of the house of יהוה, and repaired them.
\v 4 He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the wide place on the east,
\v 5 and said to them, "Listen to me, you Levites! Now set yourselves apart, and set יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers' house apart, and carry the filthiness out of the set-apart place.
\v 6 For our fathers were treacherous, and have done that which was evil in the sight of יהוה our Elohim, and have forsaken Him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of יהוה, and turned their backs.
\v 7 Also they have closed up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered ascension offerings in the set-apart place to the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 8 Therefore the wrath of יהוה was on Yehudah and Yerushalayim, and He has delivered them to be tossed back and forth, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.
\v 9 For, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
\v 10 Now it is in my heart to cut a covenant with יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, that His fierce anger may turn away from us.
\v 11 My sons, do not be negligent now; for יהוה has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and that you should be his ministers, and burn incense."
\p
\v 12 Then the Levites arose, Maḥath, the son of Amasai, and Yo'el the son of Azaryahu, of the sons of the Qohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Qish the son of Abdi, and Azaryahu the son of Yehallel'el; and of the Gershonites, Yoaḥ the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Yoaḥ;
\v 13 and of the sons of Elitsaphan, Shimri and Yeu'el; and of the sons of Asaph, Zekharyahu and Mattanyahu;
\v 14 and of the sons of Heman, Yeḥi'el and Shimi; and of the sons of Yeduthun, Shemayah and Uzzi'el.
\v 15 They gathered their brothers, set themselves apart, and went in, according to the command of the king by the words of יהוה, to cleanse the house of יהוה.
\v 16 The priests went into the inner part of the house of יהוה to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the Temple of יהוה into the court of the house of יהוה. The Levites took it from there to carry it out to the wadi Qidron.
\v 17 Now they began on the first day of the first new moon to set apart, and on the eighth day of the new moon they came to the porch of יהוה. They set apart the house of יהוה in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first new moon they finished.
\v 18 Then they went in to Ḥizqiyahu the king within the palace, and said, "We have cleansed all the house of יהוה, including the altar of ascension offering with all its vessels, and the table of show bread with all its vessels.
\v 19 Moreover all the vessels, which King Aḥaz in his reign threw away when he was treacherous, have we prepared and set apart. Behold, they are before the altar of יהוה."
\p
\v 20 Then Ḥizqiyahu the king arose early, gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of יהוה.
\v 21 They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the set-apart place, and for Yehudah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aharon to offer them on the altar of יהוה.
\v 22 So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar. They killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
\v 23 They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them.
\v 24 Then the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Yisra'el; for the king commanded that the ascension offering and the sin offering should be made for all Yisra'el.
\p
\v 25 He set the Levites in the house of יהוה with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the command of David, of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the command was from יהוה by His prophets.
\v 26 The Levites stood with David's instruments, and the priests with the trumpets.
\v 27 Ḥizqiyahu commanded them to offer the ascension offering on the altar. When the ascension offering began, the song of יהוה also began, along with the trumpets and the instruments of David king of Yisra'el.
\v 28 All the assembly bowed down, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the ascension offering was finished.
\p
\v 29 When they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him knelt themselves and bowed down.
\v 30 Moreover Ḥizqiyahu the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to יהוה with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises with gladness, and they stooped low and bowed down.
\p
\v 31 Then Ḥizqiyahu answered, "Now you have set yourselves apart to יהוה. Come near and bring sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings into the House of יהוה." The assembly brought in sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings, and as many as were of a willing heart brought ascension offerings.
\v 32 The number of the ascension offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. All these were for an ascension offering to יהוה.
\v 33 The set apart things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep.
\v 34 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the ascension offerings. Therefore their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had set themselves apart; for the Levites were more upright in heart to set themselves apart than the priests.
\v 35 Also the ascension offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every ascension offering. So the service of the house of יהוה was set in order.
\v 36 Ḥizqiyahu and all the people rejoiced, because of that which Elohim had prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 Ḥizqiyahu sent to all Yisra'el and Yehudah, and wrote letters also to Ephrayim and Menasheh, that they should come to the house of יהוה at Yerushalayim, to keep the Pesaḥ to יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 2 For the king had taken counsel with his princes and all the assembly in Yerushalayim to keep the Pesaḥ in the second new moon.
\v 3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not set themselves apart in sufficient number, and the people had not gathered themselves together to Yerushalayim.
\v 4 The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
\v 5 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Yisra'el, from Beersheva even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Pesaḥ to יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, at Yerushalayim, for they had not kept it in great numbers in the way it is written.
\p
\v 6 So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Yisra'el and Yehudah, and according to the command of the king, saying, "You children of Yisra'el, turn again to יהוה, the Elohim of Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Yisra'el, that He may return to the remnant of you that have escaped out of the hand of the kings of Ashuwr.
\v 7 Do not be like your fathers and like your brothers, who trespassed against יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, so that He gave them up to desolation, as you see.
\v 8 Now do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to יהוה, and enter into His set-apart place, which He has set apart forever, and serve יהוה your Elohim, that His fierce anger may turn away from you.
\v 9 For if you turn again to יהוה, your brothers and your children will find compassion before those who led them captive, and will come again into this land, because יהוה your Elohim is kind and compassionate, and will not turn away His face from you, if you return to Him."
\p
\v 10 So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephrayim and Menasheh, even to Zevulun, but people ridiculed them and mocked them.
\v 11 Nevertheless some men of Asher and Menasheh and of Zevulun humbled themselves, and came to Yerushalayim.
\v 12 Also the hand of Elohim came on Yehudah to give them one heart, to do the command of the king and of the princes by the word of יהוה.
\p
\v 13 Many people assembled at Yerushalayim to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second new moon, a very great assembly.
\v 14 They arose and took away the altars that were in Yerushalayim, and they took away all the altars for incense and threw them into the wadi Qidron.
\v 15 Then they killed the Pesaḥ on the fourteenth day of the second new moon. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and set themselves apart, and brought ascension offerings into the house of יהוה.
\v 16 They stood in their place after their judgment, according to the Torah of Mosheh the man of Elohim. The priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.
\v 17 For there were many in the assembly who had not set themselves apart: therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Pesaḥ lambs for everyone who was not clean, to set them apart to יהוה.
\v 18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephrayim, Menasheh, Yissakhar, and Zevulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Pesaḥ other than the way it is written. For Ḥizqiyahu had prayed for them, saying, "May the good יהוה cover everyone
\v 19 who sets his heart to seek Elohim, יהוה, the Elohim of his fathers, even if they are not clean according to the purification of the set-apart place."
\p
\v 20 יהוה listened to Ḥizqiyahu, and healed the people.
\v 21 The children of Yisra'el who were present at Yerushalayim kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great gladness. The Levites and the priests praised יהוה day by day, singing with loud instruments to יהוה.
\v 22 Ḥizqiyahu spoke from his heart to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of יהוה. So they ate throughout the Feast for the seven days, slaughtering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers.
\p
\v 23 The whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept another seven days with gladness.
\v 24 For Ḥizqiyahu king of Yehudah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests set themselves apart.
\v 25 All the assembly of Yehudah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Yisra'el, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Yisra'el, and who lived in Yehudah, rejoiced.
\v 26 So there was great joy in Yerushalayim; for since the time of Shelomoh the son of David king of Yisra'el there was nothing like this in Yerushalayim.
\v 27 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people. Their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to His set-apart habitation, even to heavens.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 Now when all this was finished, all Yisra'el who were present went out to the cities of Yehudah, and broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Yehudah and Benyamin, also in Ephrayim and Menasheh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Yisra'el returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
\p
\v 2 Ḥizqiyahu appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for ascension offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of יהוה.
\v 3 He also appointed the king's portion of his possessions for the ascension offerings, for the morning and evening ascension offerings, and the ascension offerings for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, and for the set Feasts, as it is written in the Torah of יהוה.
\v 4 Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Yerushalayim to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might strengthen themselves in the Torah of יהוה.
\v 5 As soon as the command went out, the children of Yisra'el gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and of all the increase of the field; and they brought in the tithe of all things abundantly.
\v 6 The children of Yisra'el and Yehudah, who lived in the cities of Yehudah, also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were set apart to יהוה their Elohim, and laid them in heaps.
\p
\v 7 In the third new moon they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh new moon.
\v 8 When Ḥizqiyahu and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed יהוה and His people Yisra'el.
\v 9 Then Ḥizqiyahu questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.
\v 10 Azaryahu the chief priest, of the house of Tsadoq, answered him and said, "Since people began to bring the offerings into the house of יהוה, we have eaten and had enough, and have plenty left over, for יהוה has blessed His people; and that which is left is this great store."
\p
\v 11 Then Ḥizqiyahu commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of יהוה, and they prepared them.
\v 12 They brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things in faithfulness. Konanyahu the Levite was ruler over them, and Shimi his brother was second.
\v 13 Yeḥi'el, Azazyahu, Naḥath, Asah'el, Yerimoth, Yozavad, Eli'el, Yismakyahu, Maḥath, and Benayahu were overseers under the hand of Konanyahu and Shimi his brother, by the appointment of Ḥizqiyahu the king and Azaryahu the ruler of the house of Elohim.
\v 14 Qore the son of Yimnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east gate, was over the freewill offerings of Elohim, to distribute the offerings of יהוה and the most set-apart things.
\v 15 Under him were Eden, Minyamin, Yeshua, Shemayahu, Amaryahu, and Shekanyahu, in the cities of the priests, in their faithful office, to give to their brothers by divisions, to the great as well as to the small;
\v 16 besides those who were listed by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into the house of יהוה, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions;
\v 17 and those who were listed by genealogy of the priests by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;
\v 18 and those who were listed by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation; for in their faithful office they set themselves apart in set-apartness.
\v 19 Also for the sons of Aharon the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were listed by genealogy among the Levites.
\v 20 Ḥizqiyahu did so throughout all Yehudah; and he did that which was good, right, and true before יהוה his Elohim.
\v 21 In every work that he began in the service of the house of Elohim, in the Torah, and in the commands, to seek his Elohim, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 After these things and this truth, Sanḥeriv king of Ashuwr came, entered into Yehudah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and intended to win them for himself.
\v 2 When Ḥizqiyahu saw that Sanḥeriv had come, and that he was planning to fight against Yerushalayim,
\v 3 he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city, and they helped him.
\v 4 So, many people gathered together and they stopped all the springs and the wadi that flowed through the middle of the land, saying, "Why should the kings of Ashuwr come, and find abundant water?"
\p
\v 5 And he strengthened himself, built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, with the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
\v 6 He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the wide place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,
\v 7 "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or dismayed because of the king of Ashuwr, nor for all the multitude who is with him; for there is a greater one with us than with him.
\v 8 An arm of flesh is with him, but יהוה our Elohim is with us to help us and to fight our battles." The people leaned on the words of Ḥizqiyahu king of Yehudah.
\p
\v 9 After this, Sanḥeriv king of Ashuwr sent his servants to Yerushalayim, (now he was before Lakish, and all his power with him), to Ḥizqiyahu king of Yehudah, and to all Yehudah who were at Yerushalayim, saying,
\v 10 Thus says Sanḥeriv king of Ashuwr, "On whom do you rely, that you remain under siege in Yerushalayim?
\v 11 Does not Ḥizqiyahu persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, 'יהוה our Elohim will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Ashuwr'?
\v 12 Has the same Ḥizqiyahu not taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Yehudah and Yerushalayim, saying, 'You shall bow down before one altar, and you shall burn incense on it'?
\v 13 Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the elohim of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand?
\v 14 Who was there among all the elohim of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your Elohim should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
\v 15 Now therefore do not let Ḥizqiyahu deceive you, nor persuade you in this way. Do not believe him, for no el of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your Elohim deliver you out of my hand?"
\p
\v 16 His servants spoke yet more against יהוה Elohim, and against His servant Ḥizqiyahu.
\v 17 He also wrote letters insulting יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, and speaking against Him, saying, "As the elohim of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the Elohim of Ḥizqiyahu not deliver His people out of my hand."
\v 18 They called out with a loud voice in the Yehudite language to the people of Yerushalayim who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
\v 19 They spoke of the Elohim of Yerushalayim as of the elohim of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.
\p
\v 20 Ḥizqiyahu the king and Yeshayahu the prophet the son of Amots, prayed because of this, and cried to the heavens.
\v 21 יהוה sent a messenger, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Ashuwr. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. When he had come into the house of his el, those who came out of his own gut killed him there with the sword.
\v 22 Thus יהוה saved Ḥizqiyahu and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim from the hand of Sanḥeriv the king of Ashuwr and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.
\v 23 Many brought gifts to יהוה to Yerushalayim, and precious things to Ḥizqiyahu king of Yehudah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from then on.
\p
\v 24 In those days Ḥizqiyahu was terminally ill, and he prayed to יהוה; and He spoke to him, and gave him a sign.
\v 25 But Ḥizqiyahu did not return the repayment of the benefit done for him, because his heart was lifted up. Therefore there was wrath on him, and on Yehudah and Yerushalayim.
\v 26 Notwithstanding Ḥizqiyahu humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, so that the wrath of יהוה did not come on them in the days of Ḥizqiyahu.
\p
\v 27 Ḥizqiyahu had exceedingly vast riches and honor. He provided himself with treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of valuable vessels;
\v 28 also storehouses for the increase of grain, new wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of animals, and flocks in folds.
\v 29 Moreover he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for Elohim had given him abundant possessions.
\v 30 This same Ḥizqiyahu also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Giḥon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. Ḥizqiyahu prospered in all his works.
\v 31 However concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Bavel, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, Elohim left him, to try him, that He might know all that was in his heart.
\p
\v 32 Now the rest of the acts of Ḥizqiyahu, and his loving-kindness, behold, they are written in the vision of Yeshayahu the prophet the son of Amots, and in the book of the kings of Yehudah and Yisra'el.
\v 33 Ḥizqiyahu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David. All Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim honored him at his death. Menasheh his son reigned in his place.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 Menasheh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Yerushalayim.
\v 2 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, after the abominations of the nations whom יהוה cast out before the children of Yisra'el.
\v 3 For he built again the high places which Ḥizqiyahu his father had broken down; and he raised up altars for the Ba'als, made Asheroth, and bowed down to all the army of the heavens, and served them.
\v 4 He built altars in the house of יהוה, of which יהוה said, "My Name shall be in Yerushalayim forever."
\v 5 He built altars for all the army of the heavens in the two courts of the house of יהוה.
\v 6 He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and dealt with mediums, and with wizards. He did much evil in the sight of יהוה, to provoke Him to anger.
\v 7 He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of Elohim, of which Elohim said to David and to Shelomoh his son, "In this house, and in Yerushalayim, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra'el, will I put My Name forever.
\v 8 I will not any more remove the foot of Yisra'el from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will guard to do all that I have commanded them, even all the Torah, the statutes, and the judgments given by the hand of Mosheh."
\v 9 Menasheh seduced Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, so that they did more evil than the nations whom יהוה destroyed before the children of Yisra'el did.
\p
\v 10 יהוה spoke to Menasheh, and to his people; but they did not listen.
\v 11 Therefore יהוה brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Ashuwr, who took Menasheh in chains, bound him with fetters, and carried him to Bavel.
\v 12 When he was in distress, he begged יהוה his Elohim, and humbled himself greatly before the Elohim of his fathers.
\v 13 He prayed to Him; and He was entreated by him, and heard his petition, and brought him again to Yerushalayim into his kingdom. Then Menasheh knew that יהוה was Elohim.
\p
\v 14 Now after this, he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Giḥon, in the wadi, even to the entrance at the fish gate. He encircled Ophel with it, and raised it up to a very great height; and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Yehudah.
\v 15 He took away the foreign elohim and the idol out of the house of יהוה, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of יהוה, and in Yerushalayim, and cast them out of the city.
\v 16 He built up the altar of יהוה, and slaughtered sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving on it, and commanded Yehudah to serve יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 17 Nevertheless the people still slaughtered in the high places, but only to יהוה their Elohim.
\p
\v 18 Now the rest of the acts of Menasheh, and his prayer to his Elohim, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the Name of יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Yisra'el.
\v 19 His prayer also, and how Elohim was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherah poles and the engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of the seers.
\v 20 So Menasheh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his place.
\p
\v 21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Yerushalayim.
\v 22 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, as did Menasheh his father; and Amon slaughtered to all the engraved images which Menasheh his father had made, and served them.
\v 23 He did not humble himself before יהוה, as Menasheh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.
\v 24 His servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.
\v 25 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Yoshiyahu his son king in his place.
\c 34
\p
\v 1 Yoshiyahu was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Yerushalayim.
\v 2 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, and walked in the ways of David his father, and did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\v 3 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the Elohim of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Yehudah and Yerushalayim from the high places, the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images.
\v 4 They broke down the altars of the Ba'als in his presence; and he cut down the sun-pillars that were on high above them. He broke the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images in pieces, made dust of them, and scattered it on the graves of those who had slaughtered to them.
\v 5 He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Yehudah and Yerushalayim.
\v 6 He did this in the cities of Menasheh, Ephrayim, and Shimon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins.
\v 7 He broke down the altars, and beat the Asherah poles and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all the sun-pillars throughout all the land of Yisra'el, then returned to Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Atsalyahu, and Ma'aseyahu the governor of the city, and Yoaḥ the son of Yoaḥaz the recorder, to repair the house of יהוה his Elohim.
\v 9 They came to Ḥilqiyahu the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of Elohim, which the Levites, the guards of the threshold, had gathered from the hands of Menasheh, Ephrayim, of all the remnant of Yisra'el, of all Yehudah and Benyamin, and of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim.
\v 10 They delivered it into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of יהוה; and the workmen who labored in the house of יהוה gave it to mend and repair the house.
\v 11 They gave it to the carpenters and to the builders, to buy cut stone and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Yehudah had destroyed.
\v 12 The men did the work in faithfulness. Their overseers were Yaḥath and Ovadyahu, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zekharyah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Qohathites, to give direction; and others of the Levites, who were all skillful with musical instruments.
\v 13 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and directed all who did the work in every kind of service. Of the Levites, there were scribes, officials, and gatekeepers.
\p
\v 14 When they brought out the money that was brought into the house of יהוה, Ḥilqiyahu the priest found the book of the Torah of יהוה given by the hand of Mosheh.
\v 15 Ḥilqiyahu answered Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the book of the Torah in the house of יהוה." So Ḥilqiyahu delivered the book to Shaphan.
\v 16 Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, "All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.
\v 17 They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of יהוה, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen."
\v 18 Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, "Ḥilqiyahu the priest has delivered to me a book." Shaphan read from it to the king.
\p
\v 19 When the king had heard the words of the Torah, he tore his clothes.
\v 20 The king commanded Ḥilqiyahu, Aḥiqam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Mikhah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asayah the king's servant, saying,
\v 21 "Go inquire of יהוה for me, and for those who are left in Yisra'el and in Yehudah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of יהוה that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not guarded the word of יהוה, to do according to all that is written in this book."
\p
\v 22 So Ḥilqiyahu, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Ḥuldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Toqhath, the son of Ḥasrah, guard of the wardrobe (now she lived in Yerushalayim in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect.
\p
\v 23 She said to them, "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el says: 'Tell the man who sent you to me,
\v 24 "יהוה says, 'Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Yehudah.
\v 25 Because they have forsaken Me, and have burned incense to other elohim, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore My wrath is poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.'"'
\v 26 But to the king of Yehudah, who sent you to inquire of יהוה, you shall tell him this, 'יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el says: "About the words which you have heard,
\v 27 because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Elohim, when you heard His words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before Me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before Me, I also have heard you," says יהוה.
\v 28 "Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the evil that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants."'" They brought back word to the king.
\p
\v 29 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Yehudah and Yerushalayim.
\v 30 The king went up to the house of יהוה, with all the men of Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, the priests, the Levites, and all the people, both great and small; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of יהוה.
\v 31 The king stood in his place, and cut a covenant before יהוה, to walk after יהוה, and to guard His commands, and His witnesses, and His statutes, with all his heart, and with all his being, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
\v 32 He caused all who were found in Yerushalayim and Benyamin to stand. The inhabitants of Yerushalayim did according to the covenant of Elohim, the Elohim of their fathers.
\v 33 Yoshiyahu took away all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Yisra'el, and made all who were found in Yisra'el to serve, even to serve יהוה their Elohim. All his days they did not depart from following יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers.
\c 35
\p
\v 1 Yoshiyahu kept a Pesaḥ to יהוה in Yerushalayim. They killed the Pesaḥ on the fourteenth day of the first new moon.
\v 2 He set the priests in their offices, and strengthened them in the service of the house of יהוה.
\v 3 He said to the Levites who taught all Yisra'el, who were set-apart to יהוה, "Put the set-apart ark in the house which Shelomoh the son of David king of Yisra'el built. It will no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve יהוה your Elohim, and His people Yisra'el.
\v 4 Prepare yourselves after your fathers' houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Yisra'el, and according to the writing of Shelomoh his son.
\v 5 Stand in the set-apart place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your brothers the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers' house of the Levites.
\v 6 Kill the Pesaḥ, set yourselves apart, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of יהוה by the hand of Mosheh."
\p
\v 7 Yoshiyahu gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them for the Pesaḥ offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls. These were of the king's substance.
\v 8 His princes gave for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Ḥilqiyah, Zekharyahu, and Yeḥi'el, the rulers of the house of Elohim, gave to the priests for the Pesaḥ offerings two thousand six hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle.
\v 9 Konanyahu also, and Shemayahu and Nethan'el, his brothers, and Ḥashavyahu, Yei'el, and Yozavad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Pesaḥ offerings five thousand small livestock and five hundred head of cattle.
\p
\v 10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king's command.
\v 11 They killed the Pesaḥ, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.
\v 12 They removed the ascension offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the children of the people, to offer to יהוה, as it is written in the book of Mosheh. They did the same with the cattle.
\v 13 They cooked the Pesaḥ with fire according to the judgment. They cooked the set-apart offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.
\v 14 Afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aharon were busy with offering the ascension offerings and the fat until night. Therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aharon.
\v 15 The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Yeduthun the king's seer; and the gatekeepers were at every gate. They did not need to depart from their service, because their brothers the Levites prepared for them.
\p
\v 16 So all the service of יהוה was prepared the same day, to keep the Pesaḥ, and to offer ascension offerings on the altar of יהוה, according to the command of King Yoshiyahu.
\v 17 The children of Yisra'el who were present kept the Pesaḥ at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread they kept for seven days.
\v 18 There was no Pesaḥ like that kept in Yisra'el from the days of Shemu'el the prophet, nor did any of the kings of Yisra'el keep such a Pesaḥ as Yoshiyahu kept, with the priests, the Levites, and all Yehudah and Yisra'el who were present, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim.
\v 19 This Pesaḥ was kept in the eighteenth year of the reign of Yoshiyahu.
\p
\v 20 After all this, when Yoshiyahu had prepared the Temple, Neko king of Mitsrayim went up to fight against Karkemish by the Euphrates, and Yoshiyahu went out against him.
\v 21 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, "What have I to do with you, you king of Yehudah? I come not against you today, but against the house with which I have war. Elohim has commanded me to make haste. Beware that it is Elohim who is with me, that He not destroy you."
\p
\v 22 Nevertheless Yoshiyahu would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and did not listen to the words of Neko from the mouth of Elohim, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
\v 23 The archers shot at King Yoshiyahu; and the king said to his servants, "Take me away, because I am seriously wounded!"
\p
\v 24 So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Yerushalayim; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Yehudah and Yerushalayim mourned for Yoshiyahu.
\v 25 Yirmeyahu lamented for Yoshiyahu, and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Yoshiyahu in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Yisra'el. Behold, they are written in the lamentations.
\v 26 Now the rest of the acts of Yoshiyahu, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the Torah of יהוה,
\v 27 and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Yisra'el and Yehudah.
\c 36
\p
\v 1 Then the people of the land took Yehoaḥaz the son of Yoshiyahu, and made him king in his father's place in Yerushalayim.
\v 2 Yoaḥaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three new moons in Yerushalayim.
\v 3 The king of Mitsrayim removed him from office at Yerushalayim, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
\v 4 The king of Mitsrayim made Elyaqim his brother king over Yehudah and Yerushalayim, and changed his name to Yehoyaqim. Neko took Yoaḥaz his brother, and carried him to Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 5 Yehoyaqim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim. He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה his Elohim.
\v 6 Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel came up against him, and bound him in fetters to carry him to Bavel.
\v 7 Nevukhadnetsar also carried some of the vessels of the house of יהוה to Bavel, and put them in his temple at Bavel.
\v 8 Now the rest of the acts of Yehoyaqim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Yisra'el and Yehudah; and Yehoyakin his son reigned in his place.
\v 9 Yehoyakin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three new moons and ten days in Yerushalayim. He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה.
\v 10 At the turn of the year, King Nevukhadnetsar sent and brought him to Bavel, with the valuable vessels of the house of יהוה, and made Tsidqiyahu his brother king over Yehudah and Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 11 Tsidqiyahu was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim.
\v 12 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה his Elohim. He did not humble himself before Yirmeyahu the prophet speaking from the mouth of יהוה.
\v 13 He also rebelled against King Nevukhadnetsar, who had made him swear by Elohim; but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 14 Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of יהוה which He had made set-apart in Yerushalayim.
\v 15 יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, sent to them by His messengers, rising up early and sending, because He had compassion on His people, and on His dwelling place;
\v 16 but they mocked the messengers of Elohim, and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of יהוה arose against His people, until there was no remedy.
\p
\v 17 Therefore He brought on them the king of the Kaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their set-apart place, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or gray-headed. He gave them all into his hand.
\v 18 All the vessels of the house of Elohim, great and small, and the treasures of the house of יהוה, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Bavel.
\v 19 They burned the house of Elohim, and broke down the wall of Yerushalayim, and burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all of its valuable vessels.
\v 20 He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Bavel, and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Paras,
\v 21 to fulfill the word of יהוה by Yirmeyahu's mouth, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. As long as it lay desolate, it ceases in its Sabbaths, to fulfill seventy years.
\v 22 Now in the first year of Koresh king of Paras, in order that the word of יהוה by the mouth of Yirmeyahu might be accomplished, יהוה stirred up the spirit of Koresh king of Paras, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,
\v 23 "Thus says Koresh king of Paras, 'יהוה, the Elohim of the heavens, has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me; and He has commanded me to build Him a house in Yerushalayim, which is in Yehudah. Whoever there is among you of all His people; יהוה his Elohim be with him, and let him go up.'"
