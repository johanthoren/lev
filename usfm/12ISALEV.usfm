\p
\v 1 The vision of Yeshayahu the son of Amots, which he saw concerning Yehudah and Yerushalayim, in the days of Uzziyahu, Yotham, Aḥaz, and Ḥizqiyahu, kings of Yehudah.
\b
\q1
\v 2 Hear, heavens, and listen, earth;
\q2 for יהוה has spoken:
\q1 "I have nourished and brought up children,
\q2 and they have rebelled against Me.
\q1
\v 3 The ox knows his owner,
\q2 and the donkey his master's crib;
\q1 but Yisra'el does not know,
\q2 My people do not consider."
\b
\q1
\v 4 Ah, sinful nation,
\q2 a people loaded with iniquity,
\q1 a seed of evildoers,
\q2 children who deal corruptly!
\q1 They have forsaken יהוה.
\q2 They have despised the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\q2 They are estranged and backward.
\q1
\v 5 Why should you be beaten more,
\q2 that you revolt more and more?
\q1 The whole head is sick,
\q2 and the whole heart faint.
\q1
\v 6 From the sole of the foot even to the head
\q2 there is no soundness in it:
\q1 wounds, welts, and open sores.
\q2 They have not been closed,
\q2 neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Your country is desolate.
\q2 Your cities are burned with fire.
\q1 Strangers devour your land in your presence,
\q2 and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
\q1
\v 8 The daughter of Tsion is left
\q2 like a sukkah in a vineyard,
\q1 like a hut in a field of melons,
\q2 like a preserved city.
\q1
\v 9 Unless יהוה Tsevaot
\q2 had left to us a very small remnant,
\q1 we would have been as Sedom;
\q2 we would have been like Gomorrah.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Hear the word of יהוה,
\q2 you rulers of Sedom!
\q1 Listen to the Torah of our Elohim,
\q2 you people of Gomorrah!
\q1
\v 11 "What are the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?"
\q2 says יהוה.
\q1 "I have had enough of the ascension offerings of rams,
\q2 and the fat of fed animals.
\q1 I do not delight in the blood of bulls,
\q2 or of lambs, or of male goats.
\q1
\v 12 When you come to appear before Me,
\q2 who has required this at your hand,
\q2 to trample My courts?
\q1
\v 13 Bring no more vain offerings.
\q2 Incense is an abomination to Me;
\q1 new moons, Sabbaths, and the calling of rehearsals:\f + \fr 1:13 \ft See footnote at Vayyiqra 23:2.\f*
\q2 I cannot bear with vain exertion.
\q1
\v 14 My being hates your New Moons
\q2 and your appointed feasts.
\q1 They are a burden to Me.
\q2 I am weary of bearing them.
\q1
\v 15 When you spread forth your hands,
\q2 I will hide My eyes from you.
\q1 Yes, when you make many prayers,
\q2 I will not hear.
\q2 Your hands are full of blood.
\q1
\v 16 Wash yourselves, make yourself clean.
\q2 Put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes.
\q1 Cease to do evil.
\q2
\v 17 Learn to do well.
\q1 Seek judgment.
\q2 Relieve the oppressed.
\q1 Judge the fatherless.
\q2 Plead for the widow."
\b
\q1
\v 18 "Come now, and let us reason together,"
\q2 says יהוה:
\q1 "Though your sins be as scarlet,
\q2 they shall be as white as snow.
\q1 Though they be red like crimson,
\q2 they shall be as wool.
\q1
\v 19 If you are willing and obedient,
\q2 you shall eat the good of the land;
\q1
\v 20 but if you refuse and rebel,
\q2 you shall be devoured with the sword;
\q2 for the mouth of יהוה has spoken it."
\b
\q1
\v 21 How the faithful city has become a whore!
\q2 She was full of judgment;
\q1 righteousness lodged in her,
\q2 but now murderers.
\q1
\v 22 Your silver has become dross,
\q2 your wine mixed with water.
\q1
\v 23 Your princes are rebellious,
\q2 and companions of thieves.
\q1 Everyone loves bribes,
\q2 and follows after rewards.
\q1 They do not judge the fatherless,
\q2 neither does the cause of the widow come to them.
\b
\q1
\v 24 Therefore Adonai יהוה Tsevaot,
\q2 the Mighty One of Yisra'el, says:
\q1 "Ah, I will get relief from My adversaries,
\q2 and avenge Myself of My enemies;
\q1
\v 25 and I will turn My hand on you,
\q2 thoroughly purge away your dross,
\q2 and will take away all your tin.
\q1
\v 26 I will restore your judges as at the first,
\q2 and your counselors as at the beginning.
\q1 Afterward you shall be called
\q2 'The city of righteousness, a faithful town.'
\b
\q1
\v 27 Tsion shall be redeemed with judgment,
\q2 and her converts with righteousness.
\q1
\v 28 But the destruction of transgressors and sinners
\q2 shall be together,
\q1 and those who forsake יהוה
\q2 shall be consumed.
\q1
\v 29 For they shall be ashamed
\q2 of the oaks which you have desired,
\q1 and you shall be confounded
\q2 for the gardens that you have chosen.
\q1
\v 30 For you shall be as an oak
\q2 whose leaf fades,
\q2 and as a garden that has no water.
\q1
\v 31 The strong will be like tinder,
\q2 and his work like a spark.
\q1 They will both burn together,
\q2 and no one will quench them."
\c 2
\p
\v 1 This is what Yeshayahu the son of Amots saw concerning Yehudah and Yerushalayim.
\b
\q1
\v 2 It shall happen in the latter days,
\q2 that the mountain of the house of יהוה
\q1 shall be established on the top of the mountains,
\q2 and shall be raised above the hills;
\q1 and all nations shall flow to it.
\q1
\v 3 Many peoples shall go and say,
\q2 "Come, let us go up to the mountain of יהוה,
\q2 to the house of the Elohim of Ya'aqov;
\q1 and He will teach us His ways,
\q2 and we will walk in His paths."
\q1 For from Tsion shall go forth the Torah,
\q2 and the word of יהוה from Yerushalayim.
\q1
\v 4 He will judge between the nations,
\q2 and will decide concerning many peoples;
\q1 and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
\q2 and their spears into pruning hooks.
\q1 Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
\q2 neither shall they learn war any more.
\b
\q1
\v 5 House of Ya'aqov, come,
\q2 and let us walk in the light of יהוה.
\q1
\v 6 For You have forsaken Your people,
\q2 the house of Ya'aqov,
\q1 because they are filled from the east,
\q2 with those who practice divination like the Philistines,
\q2 and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.
\q1
\v 7 Their land is full of silver and gold,
\q2 neither is there any end of their treasures.
\q1 Their land also is full of horses,
\q2 neither is there any end of their chariots.
\q1
\v 8 Their land also is full of idols.
\q2 They bow down to the work of their own hands,
\q2 that which their own fingers have made.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Man is brought low,
\q2 and mankind is humbled;
\q2 therefore do not forgive them.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Enter into the rock,
\q2 and hide in the dust,
\q1 from before the terror of יהוה,
\q2 and from the glory of His majesty.
\q1
\v 11 The lofty looks of man will be brought low,
\q2 the haughtiness of men will be bowed down,
\q2 and יהוה alone will be exalted in that day.
\b
\q1
\v 12 For there will be a day of יהוה Tsevaot
\q2 for all that is proud and haughty,
\q1 and for all that is lifted up;
\q2 and it shall be brought low:
\q1
\v 13 For all the cedars of Levanon,
\q2 that are high and lifted up,
\q2 for all the oaks of Bashan,
\q1
\v 14 For all the high mountains,
\q2 for all the hills that are lifted up,
\q1
\v 15 For every lofty tower,
\q2 for every fortified wall,
\q1
\v 16 For all the ships of Tarshish,
\q2 and for all pleasant imagery.
\q1
\v 17 The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
\q2 and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low;
\q2 and יהוה alone shall be exalted in that day.
\q1
\v 18 The idols shall utterly pass away.
\q1
\v 19 Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,
\q2 and into the holes of the earth,
\q1 from before the terror of יהוה,
\q2 and from the glory of His majesty,
\q2 when He arises to shake the earth mightily.
\b
\q1
\v 20 In that day, men shall cast away
\q2 their idols of silver,
\q2 and their idols of gold,
\q1 which have been made for themselves
\q2 to bow down to,
\q2 to the moles and to the bats;
\q1
\v 21 To go into the caverns of the rocks,
\q2 and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,
\q1 from before the terror of יהוה,
\q2 and from the glory of His majesty,
\q2 when He arises to shake the earth mightily.
\b
\q1
\v 22 Stop trusting in man,
\q2 whose breath is in his nostrils;
\q2 for of what account is he?
\c 3
\p
\q1
\v 1 For, behold, Adonai יהוה Tsevaot
\q2 takes away from Yerushalayim and from Yehudah
\q1 supply and support,
\q2 the whole supply of bread,
\q2 and the whole supply of water;
\q1
\v 2 the mighty man, the man of war,
\q2 the judge, the prophet,
\q2 the diviner, the elder,
\q1
\v 3 the captain of fifty, the honorable man,
\q2 the counselor, the skilled craftsman,
\q2 and the clever enchanter.
\q1
\v 4 I will give boys to be their princes,
\q2 and children shall rule over them.
\b
\q1
\v 5 The people will be oppressed,
\q2 everyone by another,
\q2 and everyone by his neighbor.
\q1 The child will act arrogantly against the old man,
\q2 and the lightly-esteemed against the honorable.
\q1
\v 6 Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother
\q2 in the house of his father, saying,
\q1 "You have clothing, you be our ruler,
\q2 and let this ruin be under your hand."
\q1
\v 7 In that day he will cry out, saying,
\q2 "I will not be a healer;
\q1 for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.
\q2 You shall not make me ruler of the people."
\b
\q1
\v 8 For Yerushalayim is ruined,
\q2 and Yehudah is fallen;
\q1 because their tongue and their doings are against יהוה,
\q2 to provoke the eyes of His glory.
\b
\q1
\v 9 The look of their faces testify against them.
\q2 They parade their sin like Sedom. They do not hide it.
\q1 Woe to their being!
\q2 For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
\q1
\v 10 Tell the righteous "Good!"
\q2 For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
\q1
\v 11 Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them;
\q2 for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.
\q1
\v 12 As for my people,
\q2 children are their oppressors,
\q2 and women rule over them.
\q1 My people,
\q2 those who lead you cause you to err,
\q2 and destroy the way of your paths.
\b
\q1
\v 13 יהוה stands up to contend,
\q2 and stands to judge the peoples.
\q1
\v 14 יהוה will enter into judgment
\q2 with the elders of His people, and their leaders:
\q1 "It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.
\q2 The spoil of the poor is in your houses.
\q1
\v 15 What do you mean that you crush My people,
\q2 and grind the face of the poor?"
\q2 says Adonai יהוה Tsevaot.
\b
\q1
\v 16 Moreover יהוה said,
\q2 "Because the daughters of Tsion are haughty,
\q2 and walk with outstretched necks
\q2 and flirting eyes,
\q1 walking to trip as they go,
\q2 jingling ornaments on their feet;
\q1
\v 17 therefore יהוה brings sores
\q2 on the crown of the head of the women of Tsion,
\q2 and יהוה will make their scalps bald."
\b
\p
\v 18 In that day יהוה will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces,
\v 19 the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,
\v 20 the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume bottles, the charms,
\v 21 the signet rings, the nose rings,
\v 22 the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,
\v 23 the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the turbans, and the shawls.
\p
\q1
\v 24 It shall happen that instead of sweet spices,
\q2 there shall be rottenness;
\q1 instead of a belt, a rope;
\q2 instead of worked hair, baldness;
\q1 instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth;
\q2 and branding instead of beauty.
\q1
\v 25 Your men shall fall by the sword,
\q2 and your mighty in the war.
\q1
\v 26 Her gates shall lament and mourn;
\q2 and she shall be desolate and sit on the ground.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing: only let us be called by your name. Take away our reproach."
\p
\v 2 In that day, the branch of יהוה will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Yisra'el.
\v 3 It will happen, that he who is left in Tsion, and he who remains in Yerushalayim, shall be called set-apart, even everyone who is written among the living in Yerushalayim;
\v 4 when יהוה shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Tsion, and shall have purged the blood of Yerushalayim from its midst, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
\p
\v 5 יהוה will create over the whole habitation of Mount Tsion, and over her rehearsals,\f + \fr 4:5 \ft See footnote at Vayyiqra 23:2.\f* a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy.
\p
\v 6 There will be a sukkah for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.
\c 5
\p
\q1
\v 1 Let me sing for my well-Beloved
\q2 a song of my Beloved about His vineyard.
\q1 My Beloved had a vineyard
\q2 on a very fruitful hill
\q1
\v 2 He dug it up, gathered up its stones,
\q2 planted it with the choicest vine,
\q1 built a tower in its midst,
\q2 and cut out a winepress in it.
\q1 He expected it to yield grapes,
\q2 but it yielded wild-grapes.\f + \fr 5:2 \fk Wild-grapes \ft Hebrew word בְּאֻשִׁים (be'ushim), plural of בְּאֹשׁ (be'osh), meaning "stench": lit. "stinking things." Used only here and in verse 4. It is believed by some scholars to be a reference to a poisonous berry. That is, not only is it an unprofitable fruit, but it is noxious. LXX renders this as "thorn" while the Lat. Renders it "wild vine."\f*
\b
\q1
\v 3 "Now, inhabitants of Yerushalayim and men of Yehudah,
\q2 please judge between Me and My vineyard.
\q1
\v 4 What could have been done more to My vineyard,
\q2 that I have not done in it?
\q1 Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes,
\q2 did it yield wild-grapes?
\q1
\v 5 Now I will tell you
\q2 what I will do to My vineyard.
\q1 I will take away its hedge,
\q2 and it will be eaten up.
\q1 I will break down its wall of it,
\q2 and it will be trampled down.
\q1
\v 6 I will lay it a wasteland.
\q2 It will not be pruned nor hoed,
\q2 but it will grow briers and thorns.
\q1 I will also command the clouds
\q2 that they rain no rain on it."
\q1
\v 7 For the vineyard of יהוה Tsevaot
\q2 is the house of Yisra'el,
\q1 and the men of Yehudah
\q2 His pleasant plant.
\q1 He looked for judgment,
\q2 but, behold, oppression;
\q1 for righteousness,
\q2 but, behold, a cry of distress.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Woe to those who join house to house,
\q2 who lay field to field,
\q1 until there is no room,
\q2 and you are made to dwell alone
\q2 in the midst of the land!
\q1
\v 9 In my ears, יהוה Tsevaot says:
\q2 "Surely many houses will be desolate,
\q2 even great and beautiful, unoccupied.
\q1
\v 10 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,
\q2 and an omer of seed shall yield an ephah."
\b
\q1
\v 11 Woe to those who rise up early in the morning,
\q2 that they may follow strong drink;
\q1 who stay late into the twilight,
\q2 \add until\add* wine inflames them!
\q1
\v 12 The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute,
\q2 with wine, are at their banquets;
\q1 but they do not respect the work of יהוה,
\q2 neither have they considered the operation of His hands.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Therefore my people go into captivity
\q2 for lack of knowledge.
\q1 Their honorable men are famished,
\q2 and their multitudes are parched with thirst.
\q1
\v 14 Therefore Sheol has enlarged her being,
\q2 and opened her mouth without measure;
\q1 and their glory, their multitude, their pomp,
\q2 and he who rejoices among them, descend into her.
\b
\q1
\v 15 So man is brought low, mankind is humbled,
\q2 and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;
\q1
\v 16 but יהוה Tsevaot is exalted in judgment,
\q2 and the Set-apart El is set apart in righteousness.
\b
\q1
\v 17 Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,
\q2 and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.
\q1
\v 18 Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,
\q2 and wickedness as with cart rope;
\q1
\v 19 Who say, "Let Him make speed,
\q2 let Him hasten His work,
\q2 that we may see it;
\q1 and let the counsel of the Set-apart One of Yisra'el
\q2 draw near and come, that we may know it!"
\b
\q1
\v 20 Woe to those who call evil good,
\q2 and good evil;
\q1 who put darkness for light,
\q2 and light for darkness;
\q1 who put bitter for sweet,
\q2 and sweet for bitter!
\b
\q1
\v 21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,
\q2 and prudent in their own sight!
\b
\q1
\v 22 Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine,
\q2 and champions at mixing strong drink;
\q1
\v 23 who declare right the wicked for a bribe,
\q2 but turn away the righteousness of the righteous!
\b
\q1
\v 24 Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
\q2 and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame,
\q1 so their root shall be as rottenness,
\q2 and their blossom shall go up as dust;
\q1 because they have rejected the Torah of יהוה Tsevaot,
\q2 and despised the speeches of the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\b
\q1
\v 25 Therefore the anger of יהוה burns against His people,
\q2 and He has stretched out His hand against them,
\q2 and has struck them.
\q1 The mountains tremble,
\q2 and their dead bodies are as refuse
\q2 in the midst of the streets.
\q1 For all this, His anger is not turned away,
\q2 but His hand is still stretched out.
\q1
\v 26 He will lift up a banner
\q2 to the nations from far,
\q1 and He will whistle for them
\q2 from the end of the earth.
\q1 Behold, they will come
\q2 speedily and swiftly.
\q1
\v 27 None shall be weary nor stumble among them;
\q2 none shall slumber nor sleep;
\q1 neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,
\q2 nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
\q2
\v 28 whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent.
\q1 Their horses' hoofs will be like flint,
\q2 and their wheels like a whirlwind.
\q1
\v 29 Their roaring will be like a lioness.
\q2 They will roar like young lions.
\q1 Yes, they shall roar,
\q2 and seize their prey and carry it off,
\q2 and there will be no one to deliver.
\q1
\v 30 They will roar against them in that day
\q2 like the roaring of the sea.
\q1 If one looks to the land behold,
\q2 darkness and distress.
\q2 The light is darkened in its clouds.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 In the year that King Uzziyahu died, I saw יהוה sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and His train filled the Temple.
\v 2 Above Him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.
\v 3 One called to another, and said,
\b
\q1 "Set-apart, set-apart, set-apart, is יהוה Tsevaot!
\q2 The whole earth is full of His glory!"
\b
\p
\v 4 The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
\v 5 Then I said, "Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, יהוה Tsevaot!"
\v 6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.
\v 7 He touched my mouth with it, and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is atoned for."
\p
\v 8 I heard the voice of יהוה, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here I am. Send me!"
\v 9 He said, "Go, and tell this people,
\b
\q1 'You hear indeed, but do not understand;
\q2 and you see indeed, but do not perceive.'
\q1
\v 10 Make the heart of this people fat.
\q2 Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;
\q1 lest they see with their eyes,
\q2 and hear with their ears,
\q1 and understand with their heart,
\q2 and turn again, and be healed."\f + \fr 6:10 \ft LXX and Syr. read "For the heart of this people has become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn back, and I should heal them."\f*
\p
\v 11 Then I said, "יהוה, how long?" He answered,
\b
\q1 "Until cities are waste without inhabitant,
\q2 and houses without man,
\q2 and the land becomes utterly waste,
\q1
\v 12 And יהוה has removed men far away,
\q2 and the forsaken places are many
\q2 in the midst of the land.
\q1
\v 13 If there is a tenth left in it,
\q2 that also will in turn be consumed:
\q1 as a terebinth, and as an oak,
\q2 whose stock remains when they are felled;
\q1 so the set-apart seed is its stock."
\c 7
\p
\v 1 It happened in the days of Aḥaz the son of Yotham, the son of Uzziyahu, king of Yehudah, that Retsin the king of Aram, and Peqaḥ the son of Remalyahu, king of Yisra'el, went up to Yerushalayim to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
\v 2 It was told the house of David, saying, "Aram is allied with Ephrayim." His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
\p
\v 3 Then יהוה said to Yeshayahu, "Go out now to meet Aḥaz, you, and Shearyashuv your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field.
\v 4 Tell him, '\add Be on\add* guard, and keep calm. Do not be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Retsin and Aram, and of the son of Remalyahu.
\v 5 Because Aram, Ephrayim, and the son of Remalyahu, have plotted evil against you, saying,
\v 6 "Let us go up against Yehudah, and tear it apart, and let us divide it among ourselves, and set up a king in its midst, even the son of Taveel."
\v 7 This is what Adonai יהוה says:
\b
\q1 "It shall not stand,
\q2 neither shall it happen."
\q1
\v 8 For the head of Aram is Dammeseq,
\q2 and the head of Dammeseq is Retsin;
\q1 and within sixty-five years Ephrayim shall be broken in pieces,
\q2 so that it shall not be a people;
\q1
\v 9 and the head of Ephrayim is Shom'ron,
\q2 and the head of Shom'ron is Remalyahu's son.
\q1 If you will not \add be firm\add* in faith,
\q2 surely you shall not be firm \add at all\add*.'"
\p
\v 10 יהוה spoke again to Aḥaz, saying,
\b
\q1
\v 11 "Ask a sign of יהוה your Elohim;
\q2 ask it either in the depth,
\q2 or in the height above."
\b
\p
\v 12 But Aḥaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I tempt יהוה."
\v 13 He said, "Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my Elohim also?
\v 14 Therefore יהוה Himself will give you a sign. Behold, the maiden will conceive, and bear a son, and He\f + \fr 7:14 \ft DSS reads, "and He shall call His name..." as it is here. Heb. MT reads, "and she will call His name…" LXX reads, "and you shall call His name…"\f* shall call His Name Immanu'el.\f + \fr 7:14 \fk Immanu'el \ft עמנו אל - Hebrew for "With us is El."\f*
\v 15 He shall eat butter and honey to know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
\v 16 For before the child knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken.
\p
\v 17 יהוה will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephrayim departed from Yehudah; even the king of Ashuwr.
\v 18 It will happen in that day that יהוה will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Mitsrayim, and for the bee that is in the land of Ashuwr.
\v 19 They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate wadis, in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures.
\p
\v 20 In that day יהוה will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Ashuwr, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.
\v 21 It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;
\v 22 and it shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left in the midst of the land.
\p
\v 23 It will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver sheqels, shall be for briers and thorns.
\v 24 People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns.
\v 25 All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep."
\c 8
\p
\v 1 יהוה said to me, "Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man's pen, 'For Maher Shalal Ḥash Baz;'\f + \fr 8:1 \fk Maher Shalal Ḥash Baz \ft מהר שלל חש בז – Hebrew phrase meaning "quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil."\f*
\v 2 and I will take for Myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriyah the priest, and Zekharyahu the son of Yeverekyahu."
\v 3 I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and brought forth a son. Then יהוה said to me, "Call his name 'Maher Shalal Ḥash Baz.'
\v 4 For before the child knows how to say, 'My father,' and, 'My mother,' the riches of Dammeseq and the spoil of Shom'ron will be carried away by the king of Ashuwr."
\p
\v 5 יהוה spoke to me yet again, saying,
\v 6 "Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloaḥ that go softly, and rejoice in Retsin and Remalyahu's son;
\v 7 now therefore, behold, יהוה brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Ashuwr and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.
\v 8 It will sweep onward into Yehudah. It will overflow and pass through; it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, Immanu'el.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces!
\q2 Listen, all you from far countries:
\q1 dress for battle, and be shattered!
\q2 Dress for battle, and be shattered!
\q1
\v 10 Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing;
\q2 speak the word, and it will not stand:
\q2 for El is with us."\f + \fr 8:10 \ft DSS reads, "Immanu'el" here, as in verse 8. Immanu'el means "with us is El" though in the Heb. MT it is written as "Immanu El" whereas in the DSS it is written as all one word, indicating it to be a name.\f*
\b
\p
\v 11 For יהוה spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and disciplined me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
\v 12 "Do not say, 'A conspiracy!' concerning all about which this people say, 'A conspiracy!' neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized.
\v 13 יהוה Tsevaot is who you must respect as set-apart. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread.
\v 14 He will be a set-apart place, but for both houses of Yisra'el, He will be a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Yerushalayim.
\v 15 Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured."
\p
\v 16 Wrap up the witness. Seal the Torah among my taught ones.
\v 17 I will wait for יהוה, who hides His face from the house of Ya'aqov, and I will look for Him.
\v 18 Behold, I and the children whom יהוה has given me are for signs and for wonders in Yisra'el from יהוה Tsevaot, who dwells in Mount Tsion.
\p
\v 19 When they tell you, "Consult with the mediums and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter:" should not a people consult with their Elohim? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?
\v 20 To the Torah and to the witness! If they do not speak according to this word, surely \add there is\add* no dawn in them.
\v 21 They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry; and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their Elohim. They will turn their faces upward,
\v 22 and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, He brought into contempt the land of Zevulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time He has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Yarden, the Galil of the nations.
\b
\q1
\v 2 The people who walked in darkness
\q2 have seen a great light.
\q1 Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death,
\q2 on them the light has shined.
\q1
\v 3 You have multiplied the nation.
\q2 You have increased their joy.
\q1 They rejoice before You
\q2 according to the joy in harvest,
\q2 as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
\b
\q1
\v 4 For the yoke of His burden,
\q2 and the staff of His shoulder,
\q1 the rod of His oppressor,
\q2 you have broken as in the day of Midian.
\q1
\v 5 For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle,
\q2 and the garments rolled in blood,
\q2 will be for burning, fuel for the fire.
\b
\q1
\v 6 For to us a Child is born.
\q2 To us a Son is given;
\q1 and the government will be on His shoulders.
\q2 His Name will be called Wonderful, Counselor,
\q2 Mighty El, Father of Everlasting,\f + \fr 9:6 \ft Syr. reads "Everlasting El." LXX omits all titles except "Mighty Counselor." Lat. reads "Father of the world to come."\f* Prince of Peace.
\q1
\v 7 Of the increase of His government and of peace
\q2 there shall be no end,
\q1 on the throne of David, and in His kingdom,
\q2 to establish it, and to sustain it
\q1 with judgment and with righteousness
\q2 from that time on, even forever.
\q1 The zeal of יהוה Tsevaot will perform this.
\b
\q1
\v 8 יהוה sent a word into Ya'aqov,
\q2 and it falls on Yisra'el.
\q1
\v 9 All the people will know,
\q2 including Ephrayim and the inhabitants of Shom'ron,
\q2 who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,
\q1
\v 10 "The bricks have fallen,
\q2 but we will build with cut stone.
\q1 The sycamore fig trees have been cut down,
\q2 but we will put cedars in their place."
\q1
\v 11 Therefore יהוה will set up on high against him the adversaries of Retsin,
\q2 and will stir up his enemies,
\q1
\v 12 The Arameans in front, and the Philistines behind;
\q2 and they will devour Yisra'el with open mouth.
\q1 For all this, His anger is not turned away,
\q2 but His hand is stretched out still.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Yet the people have not turned to Him who struck them,
\q2 neither have they sought יהוה Tsevaot.
\q1
\v 14 Therefore יהוה will cut off from Yisra'el
\q2 head and tail, palm branch and reed, in one day.
\q1
\v 15 The elder and the honorable man is the head,
\q2 and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail.
\q1
\v 16 For those who lead this people lead them astray;
\q2 and those who are led by them are destroyed.
\b
\q1
\v 17 Therefore יהוה will not rejoice over their young men,
\q2 neither will He have compassion on their fatherless and widows;
\q1 for everyone is profane and an evildoer,
\q2 and every mouth speaks senseless \add things\add*.
\q1 For all this His anger is not turned away,
\q2 but His hand is stretched out still.
\b
\q1
\v 18 For wickedness burns like a fire.
\q2 It devours the briers and thorns;
\q1 yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,
\q2 and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
\q1
\v 19 Through the wrath of יהוה Tsevaot,
\q2 the land is burnt up;
\q1 and the people are the fuel for the fire.
\q2 No one spares his brother.
\b
\q1
\v 20 One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry;
\q2 and he will eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied.
\q1 Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:
\q1
\v 21 Menasheh, Ephrayim; and Ephrayim, Menasheh;
\q2 and they together shall be against Yehudah.
\q1 For all this His anger is not turned away,
\q2 but His hand is stretched out still.
\c 10
\p
\q1
\v 1 Woe to those who decree decrees of vain exertion,
\q2 and to the writers who write toilsome decrees;
\q1
\v 2 to deprive the needy from judgment,
\q2 and to rob the poor among My people of their judgment,
\q1 that widows may be their spoil,
\q2 and that they may plunder the fatherless!
\b
\q1
\v 3 What will you do in the day of visitation,
\q2 and in the desolation which will come from afar?
\q1 To whom will you flee for help?
\q2 Where will you leave your wealth?
\q1
\v 4 They will only bow down under the prisoners,
\q2 and will fall under the slain.
\q1 For all this His anger is not turned away,
\q2 but His hand is stretched out still.
\q1
\v 5 Alas Ashuwrite, the rod of My anger,
\q2 the staff in whose hand is My indignation!
\q1
\v 6 I will send him against a profane nation,
\q2 and against the people who anger Me
\q2 will I give him a command to despoil the spoil,
\q1 and to plunder the plunder,
\q2 and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
\b
\q1
\v 7 However he does not mean so,
\q2 neither does his heart think so;
\q1 but it is in his heart to destroy,
\q2 and to cut off not a few nations.
\b
\q1
\v 8 For he says,
\q2 "Are not all of my princes kings?
\q1
\v 9 Is not Kalno like Karkemish?
\q2 Is not Ḥamath like Arpad?
\q3 Is not Shom'ron like Dammeseq?"
\b
\q1
\v 10 As My hand has found the kingdoms of the idols,
\q2 whose engraved images exceeded those
\q3 of Yerushalayim and of Shom'ron;
\q1
\v 11 shall I not,
\q2 as I have done to Shom'ron and her idols,
\q3 so do to Yerushalayim and her idols?
\b
\p
\v 12 Therefore it will happen that, when יהוה has performed His whole work on Mount Tsion and on Yerushalayim, I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Ashuwr, and the insolence of his haughty looks.
\v 13 For he has said,
\b
\q1 "By the strength of my hand I have done it,
\q2 and by my wisdom; for I have understanding:
\q1 and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples,
\q2 and have robbed their treasures.
\q1 Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.
\q1
\v 14 My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest,
\q2 and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned,
\q2 have I gathered all the earth.
\q1 There was no one who moved their wing,
\q2 or that opened their mouth, or chirped."
\b
\q1
\v 15 Should an axe brag against him who chops with it?
\q2 Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it?
\q1 As if a rod should lift those who lift it up,
\q2 or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood.
\q1
\v 16 Therefore the Master יהוה Tsevaot
\q2 will send leanness among his fat ones;
\q1 and under his glory a burning will be kindled
\q2 like the burning of fire.
\q1
\v 17 The light of Yisra'el will be for a fire,
\q2 and his Set-apart One for a flame;
\q1 and it will burn and devour
\q2 his thorns and his briers in one day.
\q1
\v 18 He will consume the glory of his forest,
\q2 and of his fruitful field, both being and body.
\q2 It will be as when a standard bearer faints.
\q1
\v 19 The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few,
\q2 so that a child could write their number.
\b
\p
\v 20 It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Yisra'el, and those who have escaped from the house of Ya'aqov will no more again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on יהוה, the Set-apart One of Yisra'el, in truth.
\v 21 A remnant will return, even the remnant of Ya'aqov, to the mighty El.
\v 22 For though your people, Yisra'el, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.
\p
\v 23 For Adonai יהוה Tsevaot will make a full end, and that determined, in the midst of all the earth.
\p
\v 24 Therefore Adonai יהוה Tsevaot says "My people who dwell in Tsion, do not be afraid of the Ashuwrite, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you, as Mitsrayim did.
\v 25 For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and My anger will be directed to his destruction."
\v 26 יהוה Tsevaot will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Orev. His rod will be over the sea, and He will lift it up like He did against Mitsrayim.
\v 27 It will happen in that day, that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
\p
\q1
\v 28 He has come to Aiath.
\q2 He has passed through Migron.
\q3 At Mikmash he stores his baggage.
\q1
\v 29 They have gone over the pass.
\q2 They have taken up their lodging at Geva.
\q1 Ramah trembles.
\q2 Givah of Sha'ul has fled.
\q1
\v 30 Cry aloud with your voice,
\q2 daughter of Gallim!
\q1 Listen, Laishah!
\q2 You poor Anathoth!
\q1
\v 31 Madmenah is a fugitive.
\q2 The inhabitants of Gevim flee for safety.
\b
\q1
\v 32 This very day he will halt at Nov.
\q2 He shakes his hand at the mountain
\q2 of the daughter of Tsion,
\q2 the hill of Yerushalayim.
\q1
\v 33 Behold, Adonai יהוה Tsevaot
\q2 will lop the boughs with terror.
\q1 The tall will be cut down,
\q2 and the lofty will be brought low.
\q1
\v 34 He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
\q2 and Levanon will fall by the Mighty One.
\c 11
\p
\q1
\v 1 A Shoot will come out of the stock of Yishai,
\q2 and a Branch out of his roots will bear fruit.
\q1
\v 2 The Ruaḥ of יהוה will rest on Him:
\q2 the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
\q2 the spirit of counsel and might,
\q2 the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of יהוה.
\q1
\v 3 His delight will be in the fear of יהוה.
\q2 He will not judge by the sight of His eyes,
\q3 neither decide by the hearing of His ears;
\q1
\v 4 but with righteousness He will judge the poor,
\q2 and decide with equity for the humble of the earth.
\q1 He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth;
\q2 and with the breath of His lips He will kill the wicked.
\q1
\v 5 Righteousness will be the belt of His loins,
\q2 and faithfulness the belt of His waist.
\b
\q1
\v 6 The wolf will live with the lamb,
\q2 and the leopard will lie down with the young goat;
\q1 the calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together;
\q2 and a little child will lead them.
\q1
\v 7 The cow and the bear will graze.
\q2 Their young ones will lie down together.
\q2 The lion will eat straw like the ox.
\q1
\v 8 The nursing child will play near a cobra's hole,
\q2 and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper's den.
\q1
\v 9 They will not hurt nor destroy
\q2 in all My set-apart mountain;
\q1 for the earth will be full
\q2 of the knowledge of יהוה,
\q3 as the waters cover the sea.
\b
\p
\v 10 It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the Root of Yishai, who stands as a banner of the peoples; and His resting place will be glorious.
\v 11 It will happen in that day that יהוה will set His hand again the second time to recover the remnant that is left of His people from Ashuwr, from Mitsrayim, from Pathros, from Kush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Ḥamath, and from the islands of the sea.
\p
\q1
\v 12 He will set up a banner for the nations,
\q2 and will assemble the outcasts of Yisra'el,
\q1 and gather together the dispersed of Yehudah
\q2 from the four corners of the earth.
\q1
\v 13 The envy also of Ephrayim will depart,
\q2 and those who persecute Yehudah will be cut off.
\q1 Ephrayim will not envy Yehudah,
\q2 and Yehudah will not persecute Ephrayim.
\b
\q1
\v 14 They will fly down on the shoulders
\q2 of the Philistines on the west.
\q3 Together they will plunder the children of the east.
\q1 They will extend their power over Edom and Moav,
\q2 and the children of Ammon will obey them.
\b
\q1
\v 15 יהוה will utterly destroy
\q2 the tongue of the Mitsrite Sea;
\q1 and with His scorching wind
\q2 He will wave His hand over the River,
\q1 and will split it into seven wadis,
\q2 and cause men to march over in sandals.
\q1
\v 16 There will be a highway for the remnant
\q2 that is left of His people from Ashuwr,
\q1 like there was for Yisra'el in the day
\q2 that he came up out of the land of Mitsrayim.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 In that day you will say,
\b
\q1 "I will give thanks to You, יהוה;
\q2 for though You were angry with me,
\q1 Your anger has turned away
\q2 and You comfort me.
\q1
\v 2 Behold, El is my salvation.
\q2 I will trust,\f + \fr 12:2 \ft See Explanatory Note "Rely."\f* and will not be afraid;
\q1 for Yah, יהוה, is my strength and song;

\v 4 In that day you will say,
\b
\q1 "Give thanks to יהוה! Call on His Name.
\q2 Declare His doings among the peoples.
\q3 Proclaim that His Name is exalted!
\q1
\v 5 Sing to יהוה, for He has done excellent things!
\q2 Let this be known in all the earth!

\q2 into the gates of the nobles.
\q1
\v 3 I have commanded My set-apart ones;
\q2 yes, I have called My mighty men for My anger,
\q2 even My proudly exulting ones.
\q1
\v 4 The noise of a multitude is in the mountains,
\q2 likened to a great people;
\q1 the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms
\q2 of the nations gathered together!
\q1 יהוה Tsevaot is mustering
\q2 the army for the battle.
\b
\q1
\v 5 They come from a far country,
\q2 from the end \add parts\add* of the heavens,
\q1 even יהוה, and the weapons of His indignation,
\q2 to destroy the whole land.
\q1
\v 6 Wail; for the day of יהוה is at hand!
\q2 It will come as destruction from the Almighty.
\q1
\v 7 Therefore all hands will be feeble,
\q2 and everyone's heart will melt.
\q1
\v 8 They will be dismayed.
\q2 Pangs and sorrows will seize them.
\q1 They will be in pain like a woman in labor.
\q2 They will look in amazement one at another.
\q2 Their faces will be faces of flame.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Behold, the day of יהוה comes,
\q2 cruel, with wrath and fierce anger;
\q1 to make the land a desolation,
\q2 and to destroy its sinners out of it.
\q1
\v 10 For the stars of the heavens
\q2 and its constellations will not give their light.
\q1 The sun will be darkened in its going forth,
\q2 and the moon will not cause its light to shine.
\q1
\v 11 I will punish the world for their evil,
\q2 and the wicked for their iniquity.
\q1 I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease,
\q2 and will humble the haughtiness of the tyrants.
\q1
\v 12 I will make people rarer than fine gold,
\q2 even a person than the pure gold of Ophir.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble,
\q2 and the earth will be shaken out of its place
\q1 in the wrath of יהוה Tsevaot,
\q2 and in the day of His fierce anger.
\q1
\v 14 It will happen that like a hunted gazelle,
\q2 and like sheep that no one gathers,
\q1 they will each turn to their own people,
\q2 and will each flee to their own land.
\q1
\v 15 Everyone who is found will be thrust through.
\q2 Everyone who is swept away will fall by the sword.
\q1
\v 16 Their infants also will be dashed in pieces
\q2 before their eyes.
\q1 Their houses will be ransacked,
\q2 and their wives violated.
\b
\q1
\v 17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them,
\q2 who will not value silver,
\q1 and as for gold,
\q2 they will not delight in it.
\q1
\v 18 Their bows will dash the young men in pieces;
\q2 and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb.
\q2 Their eyes will not spare children.

\q2 the beauty of the Kaldeans' pride,
\q1 will be like when Elohim overthrew
\q2 Sedom and Gomorrah.
\b
\q1
\v 20 It will never be inhabited,
\q2 neither will it be lived in
\q2 from generation to generation.
\q1 The Aravian will not pitch a tent there,
\q2 neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there.
\q1
\v 21 But wild animals of the desert will lie there,
\q2 and their houses will be full of jackals.
\q1 Ostriches will dwell there,

See also note at Shemoth 7:9. \f* in the pleasant palaces.
\q1 Her time is near to come,
\q2 and her days will not be prolonged.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 For יהוה will have compassion on Ya'aqov, and will yet choose Yisra'el, and set them in their own land. The sojourner will join himself with them, and they will unite with the house of Ya'aqov.
\v 2 The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place. The house of Yisra'el will possess them in the land of יהוה for servants and for handmaids. They will take as captives those whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
\p
\v 3 It will happen in the day that יהוה will give you rest from your sorrow, from your trouble, and from the harsh service in which you were made to serve,
\v 4 that you will take up this parable against the king of Bavel, and say,
\b
\q1 "How the oppressor has ceased!
\q2 The golden city\f + \fr 14:4 \ft Hebrew word translated as "golden city" is הדהבה (madhebah). This word is not used anywhere else in Scripture and is thought to be inaccurately written. Most scholars believe the correct word to be marhebah, which means "fury." The LXX and DSS read "furious One" as well, while the Syr. reads "zealous One." It is quite possible that the "d" was mistaken for the "r" as in Hebrew, the letters Dalet (d) and Resh (r) look very similar. [Dalet: ד] [Resh: ר]\f* has ceased!"

\v 5 יהוה has broken the staff of the wicked,

\v 1 The burden of Moav:

\q1 for in a night, Ar of Moav is laid waste,
\q2 and brought to nothing;
\q1 for in a night Qir of Moav is laid waste,
\q2 and brought to nothing.
\b
\q1
\v 2 They have gone up to Bayith,
\q2 and to Divon,
\q3 to the high places, to weep.
\q1 Moav wails over Nevo and over Medeva.
\q2 Baldness is on all of their heads.
\q3 Every beard is cut off.
\q1
\v 3 In their streets, they clothe themselves in sackcloth.
\q2 In their streets and on their housetops,
\q3 everyone wails, weeping abundantly.
\q1
\v 4 Ḥeshbon cries out with Elealeh.
\q2 Their voice is heard even to Yaḥaz.
\q1 Therefore the armed men of Moav cry aloud.
\q2 Their beings tremble within them.
\b
\q1
\v 5 My heart cries out for Moav!
\q2 Her nobles flee to Tsoar,
\q3 to Eglath Shelishiyah;
\q1 for they go up by the ascent of Luḥith with weeping;
\q2 for in the way of Ḥoronayim,
\q3 they raise up a cry of destruction.
\q1
\v 6 For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate;
\q2 for the grass has withered away,
\q1 the tender grass fails,
\q2 there is no green thing.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Therefore they will carry away
\q2 the abundance they have gotten,
\q1 and that which they have stored up,
\q2 over the wadi of the willows.
\q1
\v 8 For the cry has gone around the borders of Moav;
\q2 its wailing to Eglaim,
\q3 and its wailing to Beer Elim.
\q1
\v 9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood;
\q2 for I will bring yet more on Dimon,
\q1 a lion on those of Moav who escape,
\q2 and on the remnant of the land.
\c 16
\p
\q1
\v 1 Send the lambs for the ruler of the land
\q2 from Selah to the wilderness,
\q3 to the mountain of the daughter of Tsion.
\q1
\v 2 For it will be that as wandering birds,
\q2 as a scattered nest,
\q1 so will the daughters of Moav be
\q2 at the fords of the Arnon.
\q1
\v 3 Give counsel! Execute justice!
\q2 Make your shade like the night
\q3 in the midst of the noonday!
\q1 Hide the outcasts!
\q2 Do not betray the fugitive!
\b
\q1
\v 4 Let My outcasts dwell with you!
\q2 As for Moav, be a secret \add place\add* for him
\q3 from the face of the destroyer.
\q1 For the extortioner is brought to nothing.
\q2 Destruction ceases.
\q3 The oppressors are consumed out of the land.
\b
\q1
\v 5 A throne will be established in loving-kindness,
\q2 and he will sit on it in truth,
\q2 in the tent of David,
\q1 judging, seeking judgment,
\q2 and swift to do righteousness.
\q1
\v 6 We have heard of the pride of Moav,
\q2 that he is very proud;
\q1 even of his arrogance, his pride, and his wrath.
\q2 His boastings are nothing.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Therefore Moav will wail for Moav.
\q2 Everyone will wail.
\q1 You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Qir Ḥareseth,
\q2 utterly stricken.
\b
\q1
\v 8 For the fields of Ḥeshbon wither
\q2 with the vine of Sivmah.
\q1 The owners of the nations
\q2 have broken down its choice branches,
\q1 which reached even to Yazer,
\q2 which wandered into the wilderness.
\q1 Its shoots were spread abroad.
\q2 They passed over the sea.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Yazer
\q2 for the vine of Sivmah.
\q1 I will water you with My tears,
\q2 Ḥeshbon, and Elealeh:
\q1 for on your summer fruits and on your harvest
\q2 the battle shout has fallen.
\q1
\v 10 Gladness is taken away,
\q2 and joy out of the fruitful field;
\q1 and in the vineyards there will be no singing,
\q2 neither joyful noise.
\q1 No one will tread out wine in the presses.
\q2 I have made the shouting stop.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Therefore my gut sounds like a harp for Moav,
\q2 and my inward parts for Qir Ḥeres.
\q1
\v 12 It will happen that when Moav presents himself,
\q2 when he wearies himself on the high place,
\q1 and comes to his set-apart place to pray,
\q2 that he will not prevail.
\b
\p
\v 13 This is the word that יהוה spoke concerning Moav in time past.
\v 14 But now יהוה has spoken, saying,
\b
\q1 "Within three years,
\q2 as a worker bound by contract would count them,

\q2 and none shall make them afraid.
\q1
\v 3 The fortress shall cease from Ephrayim,
\q2 and the kingdom from Dammeseq,
\q2 and the remnant of Aram.

\v 4 "It will happen in that day
\q2 that the glory of Ya'aqov will be made thin,
\q2 and the fatness of his flesh will become lean.
\q1
\v 5 It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat,
\q2 and his arm reaps the grain.
\q1 Yes, it will be like when one gleans grain
\q2 in the valley of Rephaim.

\v 8 They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the sun-pillars.
\p
\v 9 In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Yisra'el; and it will be a desolation.
\b
\q1
\v 10 For you have forgotten the Elohim of your salvation,

\v 16 'What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?' Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!"
\p
\v 17 Behold, יהוה will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, He will grasp you firmly.
\v 18 He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame of your master's house.
\v 19 I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station.
\v 20 It will happen in that day that I will call My servant Elyaqim the son of Ḥilqiyahu,
\v 21 and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and to the house of Yehudah.
\v 22 I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.
\v 23 I will fasten him like a nail in a firm place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father's house.
\v 24 They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.
\p
\v 25 "In that day," says יהוה Tsevaot, "the nail that was fastened in a firm place will give way. It will be cut down, and fall. The burden that was on it will be cut off, for יהוה has spoken it."
\c 23
\p
\v 1 The burden\f + \fr 23:1 \ft See footnote at Yeshayahu 13:1.\f* of Tsor.
\b
\q1 Howl, you ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste,
\q2 so that there is no house, no entering in.
\q1 From the land of Kittim
\q2 it is revealed to them.
\b
\q1
\v 2 Be still, you inhabitants of the coast,
\q2 you whom the merchants of Tsidon,
\q2 that pass over the sea, have replenished.
\q1
\v 3 On great waters, the seed of the Shiḥor,
\q2 the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue.
\q2 She was the market of nations.
\q1
\v 4 Be ashamed, Tsidon; for the sea has spoken,
\q2 the stronghold of the sea, saying,
\q1 "I have not travailed, nor brought forth,
\q2 neither have I nourished young men,
\q2 nor brought up virgins."
\q1
\v 5 When the report comes to Mitsrayim,
\q2 they will be in anguish at the report of Tsor.
\q1
\v 6 Pass over to Tarshish!
\q2 Wail, you inhabitants of the coast!
\q1
\v 7 Is this your joyous city,
\q2 whose antiquity is of ancient days,
\q2 whose feet carried her far away to travel?
\q1
\v 8 Who has planned this against Tsor,
\q2 the giver of crowns,
\q1 whose merchants are princes,
\q2 whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?
\b
\q1
\v 9 יהוה Tsevaot has planned it,
\q2 to stain the pride of all glory,
\q1 to bring into contempt
\q2 all the honorable of the earth.
\q1
\v 10 Pass through\f + \fr 23:10 \ft DSS and some LXX manuscripts read, "Till your land" instead of "Pass through your land."\f* your land like the Nile,
\q3 daughter of Tarshish.
\q2 There is no restraint any more.
\q1
\v 11 He has stretched out His hand over the sea.
\q2 He has shaken the kingdoms.
\q1 יהוה has ordered the destruction
\q2 of Kena'an's strongholds.
\q1
\v 12 He said, "You shall rejoice no more,
\q2 you oppressed virgin daughter of Tsidon.
\q1 Arise, pass over to Kittim.
\q2 Even there you will have no rest."
\b
\q1
\v 13 Behold, the land of the Kaldeans.
\q2 This people was not.
\q1 The Ashuwrites founded it
\q2 for those who dwell in the wilderness.
\q1 They set up their towers.
\q2 They overthrew its palaces.
\q3 They made it a ruin.
\b
\q1
\v 14 Howl, you ships of Tarshish,
\q2 for your stronghold is laid waste!
\b
\p
\v 15 It will come to pass in that day that Tsor will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tsor like in the song of the whore.
\b
\q1
\v 16 Take a harp;
\q2 go about the city,
\q1 you whore that has been forgotten.
\q2 Make sweet melody.
\q1 Sing many songs,
\q2 that you may be remembered.
\b
\p
\v 17 It will happen after the end of seventy years that יהוה will visit Tsor, and she shall return to her wages, and will whore with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth.
\v 18 Her merchandise and her wages will be set-apart to יהוה. It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before יהוה, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
\c 24
\p
\q1
\v 1 Behold, יהוה makes the earth empty, makes it waste,
\q2 turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.
\q1
\v 2 It will be as with the people, so with the priest;
\q2 as with the servant, so with his master;
\q1 as with the maid, so with her mistress;
\q2 as with the buyer, so with the seller;
\q1 as with the creditor, so with the debtor;
\q2 as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.
\q1
\v 3 The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly plundered;
\q2 for יהוה has spoken this word.
\q1
\v 4 The earth mourns and fades away.
\q2 The world withers and fades away.
\q2 The lofty people of the earth wither.
\q1
\v 5 The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants,
\q2 because they have transgressed the Torah,
\q2 changed the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.
\q1
\v 6 Therefore the curse has devoured the earth,
\q2 and those who dwell therein are found guilty.
\q1 Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned,
\q2 and few men left.
\b
\q1
\v 7 The new wine mourns.
\q2 The vine withers.
\q2 All the merry-hearted sigh.
\q1
\v 8 The mirth of tambourines ceases.
\q2 The sound of those who rejoice ends.
\q2 The joy of the harp ceases.
\q1
\v 9 They will not drink wine with a song.
\q2 Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.
\q1
\v 10 The confused city is broken down.
\q2 Every house is closed up, that no man may come in.
\q1
\v 11 There is a crying in the streets because of the wine.
\q2 All joy is darkened.
\q2 The mirth of the land is gone.
\q1
\v 12 The city is left in desolation,
\q2 and the gate is struck with destruction.
\q1
\v 13 For it will be so in the midst of the earth
\q2 among the peoples,
\q1 as the shaking of an olive tree,
\q2 as the gleanings when the vintage is done.
\q1
\v 14 These shall lift up their voice.
\q2 They will shout for the majesty of יהוה.
\q2 They cry aloud from the sea.
\b
\q1
\v 15 Therefore glorify יהוה in the east,
\q2 even the Name of יהוה,
\q1 the Elohim of Yisra'el,
\q2 in the islands of the sea!
\q1
\v 16 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs.
\q2 Glory to the righteous!
\q1 But I said, "I pine away!
\q2 I pine away! Woe is me!"
\q1 The deceitful have dealt deceitfully.
\q2 Yes, the deceitful have dealt very deceitfully.
\b
\q1
\v 17 Fear, the pit, and the snare,
\q2 are on you who inhabit the earth.
\q1
\v 18 It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear
\q2 will fall into the pit;
\q1 and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit
\q2 will be taken in the snare;
\q1 for the windows on high are opened,
\q2 and the foundations of the earth tremble.
\b
\q1
\v 19 The earth is utterly broken.
\q2 The earth is torn apart.
\q2 The earth is shaken violently.
\q1
\v 20 The earth will stagger like a drunken man,
\q2 and will sway back and forth like a hut.
\q1 Its disobedience will be heavy on it,
\q2 and it will fall and not rise again.
\b
\q1
\v 21 It shall happen in that day that יהוה will punish
\q2 the army of the high ones on high,
\q2 and the kings of the earth on the earth.
\q1
\v 22 They shall be gathered together,
\q2 as prisoners are gathered in the pit,
\q1 and shall be closed up in the prison;
\q2 and after many days shall they be visited.
\q1
\v 23 Then the moon shall be confounded,
\q2 and the sun ashamed;
\q1 for יהוה Tsevaot will reign on Mount Tsion,
\q2 and in Yerushalayim;
\q1 and before His elders will be glory.
\c 25
\p
\q1
\v 1 יהוה, You are my Elohim.
\q2 I will exalt You!
\q1 I will praise Your Name,
\q2 for You have done wonderful things,
\q1 things planned long ago,
\q2 in complete faithfulness \add and\add* truth.
\q1
\v 2 For You have made a city into a heap,
\q2 a fortified city into a ruin,
\q1 a palace of strangers to be no city.
\q2 It will never be built.
\q1
\v 3 Therefore a strong people will glorify You.
\q2 A city of tyrannical nations will fear You.
\b
\q1
\v 4 For You have been a stronghold to the poor,
\q2 a stronghold to the needy in his distress,
\q1 a refuge from the storm,
\q2 a shade from the heat,
\q1 when the blast of the tyrants
\q2 is like a storm against the wall.
\q1
\v 5 As the heat in a dry place
\q2 will You bring down the noise of strangers;
\q1 as the heat by the shade of a cloud,
\q2 the song of the tyrants will be brought low.
\b
\q1
\v 6 In this mountain, יהוה Tsevaot will make all peoples
\q2 a banquet of fat things, a banquet of choice wines,
\q2 of fat things full of marrow, of well refined choice wines.
\q1
\v 7 He will destroy in this mountain
\q2 the surface of the covering
\q2 that covers all peoples,
\q1 and the veil that is spread
\q2 over all nations.
\q1
\v 8 He has swallowed up death forever!
\q2 Adonai יהוה will wipe away
\q2 tears from off all faces.
\q1 He will take the reproach of His people away
\q2 from off all the earth,
\q2 for יהוה has spoken it.
\b
\q1
\v 9 It shall be said in that day,
\q2 "Behold, this is our Elohim!
\q2 We have waited for Him, and He will save us!
\q1 This is יהוה! We have waited for Him.
\q2 We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation!"
\q1
\v 10 For in this mountain the hand of יהוה will rest.
\q2 Moav will be trodden down in his place,
\q1 even like straw is trodden down
\q2 in the water of the dunghill.
\b
\q1
\v 11 He will spread out his hands in its midst,
\q2 like one who swims spreads out hands to swim,
\q1 but his pride will be humbled
\q2 together with the craft of his hands.
\q1
\v 12 He has brought the high fortress of your walls down,
\q2 laid low, and brought to the ground,
\q2 even to the dust.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Yehudah:
\b
\q1 "We have a strong city.
\q2 Elohim appoints salvation
\q2 for walls and ramparts.
\q1
\v 2 Open the gates,
\q2 that the righteous nation may enter:
\q2 the one who guards faithfulness.
\q1
\v 3 You will protect the one of steady inclination,
\q2 in perfect peace,
\q2 because he relies on You.
\rem Originally verse 3 had "-" as separators. I have removed these because of the poetic line breaks. (Johan Thorén 2018-07-12 20:08 CEST)
\q1
\v 4 Rely on יהוה forever;
\q2 for in Yah, יהוה, is an everlasting Rock.
\q1
\v 5 For He has brought down those who dwell on high,
\q2 the lofty city. He lays it low.
\q1 He lays it low even to the ground.
\q2 He brings it even to the dust.
\q1
\v 6 The foot shall tread it down;
\q2 even the feet of the poor,
\q2 and the steps of the needy."
\b
\q1
\v 7 The way of the righteous is uprightness.
\q2 You who are upright make the path of the righteous level.
\q1
\v 8 Yes, in the way of Your judgments,
\q2 יהוה, have we waited for You.
\q1 Your Name and Your renown
\q2 are the desire of our being.
\q1
\v 9 With my being have I desired You in the night.
\q2 Yes, with my spirit within me
\q2 will I seek You earnestly;
\q1 for when Your judgments are in the earth,
\q2 the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
\q1
\v 10 Let favor be shown to the wicked,
\q2 yet he will not learn righteousness.
\q1 In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully,
\q2 and will not see the majesty of יהוה.
\b
\q1
\v 11 יהוה, Your hand is lifted up,
\q2 yet they do not see;
\q1 but they will see Your zeal for the people,
\q2 and be disappointed.
\q1 Yes, fire will consume Your adversaries.
\q1
\v 12 יהוה, You will ordain peace for us,
\q2 for You have also worked all our works for us.
\q1
\v 13 יהוה our Elohim,
\q2 other masters besides You have had dominion over us,
\q2 but by You only will we make mention of Your Name.
\q1
\v 14 The dead shall not live.
\q2 The Rephaim shall not rise.
\q1 Therefore have You visited and destroyed them,
\q2 and caused all memory of them to perish.
\b
\q1
\v 15 You have increased the nation, O יהוה.
\q2 You have increased the nation!
\q1 You are glorified!
\q2 You have enlarged all the borders of the land.
\q1
\v 16 יהוה, in trouble they have visited You.
\q2 They poured out a prayer
\q2 when Your correction was on them.
\q1
\v 17 As a woman with child
\q2 who draws near the time of her delivery
\q2 is in pain and cries out in her pangs,
\q1 so we have been before You, יהוה.
\q2
\v 18 We have been with child. We have been in pain.
\q2 We gave birth, it seems, only to wind.
\q1 We have not worked any deliverance in the earth;
\q2 neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
\b
\q1
\v 19 Your dead shall live.
\q2 My dead bodies shall arise.
\q1 Awake and sing,
\q2 you who dwell in the dust;
\q1 for your dew is like the dew of evening-light,
\q2 and the earth will cast forth the Rephaim.
\b
\q1
\v 20 Come, my people, enter into your rooms,
\q2 and shut your doors behind you.
\q1 Hide yourself for a little moment,
\q2 until the indignation is past.
\b
\q1
\v 21 For, behold, יהוה comes forth out of His place
\q2 to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.
\q1 The earth also will disclose her blood,
\q2 and will no longer cover her slain.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 In that day, יהוה with His hard and great and strong sword will punish Livyathan, the fleeing naḥash, and Livyathan the twisted naḥash; and He will kill the monster\f + \fr 27:1 \fk Monster \ft See footnote at Yeshayahu 13:22.\f* that is in the sea.
\v 2 In that day, sing to her,
\b
\q1 "A pleasant vineyard!
\q2
\v 3 I, יהוה, am its preserver.
\q1 I will water it every moment.
\q3 Lest anyone damage it,
\q2 I will keep it night and day.
\q1
\v 4 Wrath is not in Me,
\q3 but if I should find briers and thorns,
\q2 I would do battle!
\q1 I would march on them
\q2 and I would burn them together.
\q1
\v 5 Or else let him take hold of My strength,
\q2 that he may make peace with Me.
\q2 Let him make peace with Me."
\b
\q1
\v 6 In days to come, Ya'aqov will take root.
\q2 Yisra'el will blossom and bud.
\q2 They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Has He struck them as He struck those who struck them?
\q2 Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?
\q1
\v 8 In measure, when You send them away, You contend with them.
\q2 He has removed them with His rough blast in the day of the east wind.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Therefore, by this the iniquity of Ya'aqov will be atoned \add for\add*,
\q2 and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin:
\q1 that he makes all the stones of the altar
\q2 as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces,
\q1 so that the Asherim and the sun-pillars
\q2 shall rise no more.
\q1
\v 10 For the fortified city is solitary,
\q2 a habitation deserted and forsaken,
\q3 like the wilderness.
\q1 The calf will feed there,
\q2 and there he will lie down,
\q3 and consume its branches.
\b
\q1
\v 11 When its boughs are withered,
\q2 they will be broken off.
\q1 The women will come and set them on fire,
\q2 for they are a people of no understanding.
\q1 Therefore He who made them will not have compassion on them,
\q2 and He who formed them will show them no favor.
\b
\p
\v 12 It will happen in that day, that יהוה will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the wadi of Mitsrayim; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Yisra'el.
\v 13 It will happen in that day that a great shofar will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Ashuwr, and those who were outcasts in the land of Mitsrayim, shall come; and they will bow down to יהוה in the set-apart mountain at Yerushalayim.
\c 28
\p
\q1
\v 1 Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephrayim,
\q2 and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty,
\q1 which is on the head of the fertile valley
\q2 of those who are overcome with wine!
\q1
\v 2 Behold, יהוה has a mighty and strong one.
\q2 Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm,
\q1 and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing,
\q2 He will cast them down to the earth with His hand.
\q1
\v 3 The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephrayim
\q2 will be trodden under foot.
\q1
\v 4 The fading flower of his glorious beauty,
\q2 which is on the head of the fertile valley,
\q1 shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer;
\q2 which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it.
\b
\q1
\v 5 In that day, יהוה Tsevaot will become a crown of glory,
\q2 and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of His people;
\q1
\v 6 and a spirit of judgment to him who sits in the judgment,
\q2 and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
\b
\q1
\v 7 They also reel with wine,
\q2 and stagger with strong drink.
\q1 The priest and the prophet
\q2 reel with strong drink.
\q1 They are swallowed up by wine.
\q2 They stagger with strong drink.
\q1 They err in vision.
\q2 They stumble in judgment.
\q1
\v 8 For all tables are completely full of vomit and filthiness,
\q2 \add so that there is\add* no place.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Whom will He teach knowledge?
\q2 To whom will He explain the message?
\q1 Those who are weaned from the milk,
\q2 and drawn from the breasts?
\q1
\v 10 For it is order on order, order on order;
\q2 line on line, line on line;
\q2 here a little, there a little.
\q1
\b
\v 11 But He will speak to this nation
\q2 with stammering lips and in another language;
\q1
\v 12 to whom He said,
\q2 "This is the resting place. Give rest to \add the\add* weary;"
\q2 and "This is the refreshing;" yet they would not hear.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Therefore the word of יהוה will be to them
\q2 order on order, order on order;
\q3 line on line, line on line;
\q3 here a little, there a little;
\q2 that they may go, fall backward,
\q3 be broken, be snared, and be taken.
\b
\q1
\v 14 Therefore hear the word of יהוה, you scoffers,
\q2 that rule this people in Yerushalayim:
\q1
\v 15 "Because you have said, 'We have cut a covenant with death,
\q2 and we are in agreement with Sheol.
\q1 When the overflowing scourge passes through,
\q2 it will not come to us;
\q1 for we have made lies our refuge,
\q2 and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.'"
\b
\q1
\v 16 Therefore thus says Adonai יהוה,
\q2 "Behold, I lay in Tsion for a foundation
\q3 a Stone, a tried Stone,
\q2 a precious Cornerstone of a sure foundation.
\q3 He who trusts \add in it\add* shall not act hastily.
\q1
\v 17 I will make judgment the measuring line,
\q2 and righteousness the plumb line.
\q1 The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
\q2 and the waters will overflow the hiding place.
\q1
\v 18 Your covenant with death shall be atoned \add for\add*,
\q2 and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand.
\q1 When the overflowing scourge passes through,
\q2 then you will be trampled down by it.
\q1
\v 19 As often as it passes through,
\q2 it will seize you;
\q1 for morning by morning it will pass through,
\q2 by day and by night;
\q1 and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message."
\b
\q1
\v 20 For the bed is too short to stretch out on,
\q2 and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in.
\q1
\v 21 For יהוה will rise up as on Mount Peratsim.
\q2 He will be angry as in the valley of Givon;
\q1 that He may do His service,
\q2 His strange service,
\q1 and bring to pass His act,
\q2 His foreign act.
\q1
\v 22 Now therefore do not be scoffers,
\q2 lest your bonds be made strong;
\q1 for I have heard a decree of destruction
\q2 from Adonai יהוה Tsevaot, on the whole earth.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Give ear, and hear my voice!
\q2 Listen, and hear my speech!
\q1
\v 24 Does he who plows to sow plow continually?
\q2 Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods?
\q1
\v 25 When he has leveled its surface,
\q2 does he not plant the dill,
\q1 and scatter the cumin seed,
\q2 and put in the wheat in rows,
\q1 the barley in the appointed place,
\q2 and the spelt in its place?
\b
\q1
\v 26 For his Elohim disciplines him
\q2 with right judgment, and teaches him.
\q1
\v 27 For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument,
\q2 neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin;
\q1 but the dill is beaten out with a stick,
\q2 and the cumin with a rod.
\q1
\v 28 Bread flour must be ground;
\q2 so he will not always be threshing it.
\q1 Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it,
\q2 his horses do not grind it.
\q1
\v 29 This also comes forth from יהוה Tsevaot,
\q2 who is wonderful in counsel,
\q2 and excellent in wisdom.
\c 29
\p
\q1
\v 1 Woe to Ari'el! Ari'el,
\q2 the city where David encamped!
\q1 Add year to year;
\q2 let the Feasts come around.
\q1
\v 2 Then I will distress Ari'el,
\q2 and there will be mourning and lamentation.
\q2 She shall be to Me as an altar hearth.\f + \fr 29:2 \fk Altar hearth \ft Hebrew word for "altar hearth," אריאל (ariiyl), is spelled identically to the name Ari'el, (though they have different vowels). It is possible this is a play on words.\f*
\q1
\v 3 I will encamp against you all around you,
\q2 and will lay siege against you with posted troops.
\q2 I will raise siege works against you.
\q1
\v 4 You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground.
\q2 Your speech will mumble out of the dust.
\q1 Your voice will be as a medium, out of the ground,
\q2 and your speech will whisper out of the dust.
\b
\q1
\v 5 But the multitude of your strangers will be like fine dust,
\q2 and the multitude of tyrants like chaff that blows away.
\q2 Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.
\q1
\v 6 She will be visited by יהוה Tsevaot with thunder,
\q2 with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm,
\q2 and with the flame of a devouring fire.
\q1
\v 7 The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ari'el,
\q2 even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her,
\q2 will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
\q1
\v 8 It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats;
\q2 but he awakes, and his being is empty;
\q1 or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks;
\q2 but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and his being is not satisfied.
\q1 The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Tsion
\q2 will be like that.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind!
\q2 They are drunken, but not with wine;
\q2 they stagger, but not with strong drink.
\q1
\v 10 For יהוה has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep,
\q2 and has closed your eyes, the prophets;
\q2 and he has covered your heads, the seers.
\b

\v 11 All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, "Read this, please;" and he says, "I cannot, for it is sealed:"
\v 12 and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, "Read this, please;" and he says, "I cannot read."
\b
\q1
\v 13 יהוה said,
\q2 "Because this people draws near with their mouth
\q2 and with their lips to honor Me,
\q1 but they have removed their heart far from Me,
\q2 and their fear of Me is a command of men which has been taught;
\q1
\v 14 therefore, behold,
\q2 I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people,
\q2 even a marvelous work and a wonder;
\q1 and the wisdom of their wise men will perish,
\q2 and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden."
\b
\q1
\v 15 Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from יהוה,
\q2 and whose works are in the dark, and who say,
\q2 "Who sees us?" and "Who knows us?"
\q1
\v 16 You turn things upside down!
\q2 Should the potter be thought to be like clay;
\q1 that the thing made should say about him who made it,
\q2 "He did not make me;"
\q1 or the thing imagined say of him who imagined it,
\q2 "He has no understanding"?
\b
\q1
\v 17 Is it not yet a very little while,
\q2 and Levanon will be turned into a fruitful field,
\q2 and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?
\q1
\v 18 In that day, the deaf will hear
\q2 the words of the book,
\q1 and the eyes of the blind will see
\q2 out of obscurity and out of darkness.
\q1
\v 19 The humble also will increase their joy in יהוה,
\q2 and the poor among men will rejoice in the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\q1
\v 20 For the tyrant is brought to nothing,
\q2 and the scoffer ceases,
\q1 and all those who are alert to work vain exertion are cut off—
\q1
\v 21 who cause a person to be indicted by a word,
\q2 and lay a snare for the arbiter in the gate,
\q2 and who deprive the innocent of justice with nothingness.
\b
\p
\v 22 Therefore thus says יהוה, who redeemed Avraham, concerning the house of Ya'aqov:
\b
\q1 "Ya'aqov shall no longer be ashamed,
\q2 neither shall his face grow pale.
\q1
\v 23 But when he sees his children,
\q3 the work of My hands, in the midst of him,
\q2 they will set My Name apart.
\q1 Yes, they will set the Set-apart One of Ya'aqov apart,
\q2 and will stand in awe of the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\q1
\v 24 They also who err in spirit will come to understanding,
\q2 and those who grumble will receive instruction."
\c 30
\p
\q1
\v 1 "Woe to the rebellious children," says יהוה,
\q2 "who take counsel, but not from Me;
\q1 and who make an alliance, but not with My Ruaḥ,
\q2 that they may add sin to sin,
\q1
\v 2 who set out to go down into Mitsrayim,
\q2 and have not asked My advice;
\q1 to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
\q2 and to take refuge in the shadow of Mitsrayim!
\q1
\v 3 Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame,
\q2 and the refuge in the shadow of Mitsrayim your confusion.
\q1
\v 4 For their princes are at Tsoan,
\q2 and their ambassadors have come to Ḥanes.
\q1
\v 5 They shall all be ashamed
\q2 because of a people that cannot profit them,
\q1 that are not a help nor profit,
\q2 but a shame, and also a reproach."
\b
\p
\v 6 The burden\f + \fr 30:6 \ft See footnote at Yeshayahu 13:1.\f* of the beasts of the South.
\b
\q1 Through the land of trouble and anguish,
\q2 of the lioness and the lion,
\q2 the viper and fiery flying serpent,
\q1 they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys,
\q2 and their treasures on the humps of camels,
\q2 to an unprofitable people.
\q1
\v 7 For Mitsrayim helps in vain, and to no purpose;
\q2 therefore have I called her 'Rahav-hem-shavet.'\f + \fr 30:7 \fk ra'hav heym sha'vet \ft רהב הם שבת – Hebrew phrase meaning "their arrogance is to rest" or "their arrogance is to sit still."\f*
\b
\q1
\v 8 Now go, write it before them on a tablet,
\q2 and inscribe it in a book,
\q1 that it may be for the time to come
\q2 forever and ever.
\q1
\v 9 For it is a rebellious people,
\q2 lying children,
\q1 children who will not hear
\q2 the Torah of יהוה;
\q1
\v 10 who tell the seers,
\q2 "Do not see!"
\q1 and to the prophets,
\q2 "Do not prophesy to us right things.
\q1 Tell us pleasant things.
\q2 Prophesy deceits.
\q1
\v 11 Get out of the way.
\q2 Turn aside from the path.
\q1 Cause the Set-apart One of Yisra'el
\q2 to cease from before us.
\q1
\v 12 Therefore thus says the Set-apart One of Yisra'el,
\q1 "Because you despise this word,
\q2 and rely on oppression and perverseness,
\q2 and lean on it;
\q1
\v 13 therefore this iniquity shall be to you
\q2 like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall,
\q2 whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.
\q1
\v 14 He will break it as a potter's vessel is broken,
\q2 breaking it in pieces without sparing,
\q1 so that there will not be found among the broken piece
\q2 a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth,
\q2 or to dip up water out of the cistern."
\b
\q1
\v 15 For thus said Adonai יהוה, the Set-apart One of Yisra'el,
\q2 "You will be saved in returning and rest.
\q2 Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence."
\q1 You refused, \v 16 but you said,
\q1 "No, for we will flee on horses;"
\q2 therefore you will flee; and,
\q1 "We will ride on the swift;"
\q2 therefore those who pursue you will be swift.
\q1
\v 17 One thousand will flee at the rebuke of one.
\q2 At the rebuke of five, you will flee
\q1 until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain,
\q2 and like a banner on a hill.
\q1
\v 18 Therefore יהוה will wait,
\q2 that He may be favorable to you;
\q1 and therefore He will be exalted,
\q2 that He may have compassion on you,
\q1 for יהוה is an Elohim of judgment.
\q2 Happy are all those who wait for Him.
\b
\p
\v 19 For the people will dwell in Tsion at Yerushalayim. You will weep no more. He will surely be favorable to you at the voice of your cry. When He hears you, He will answer you.
\v 20 Though יהוה may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers will not be hidden anymore, but your eyes will see your teachers;
\v 21 and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way. Walk in it."
\v 22 You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as a sick\f + \fr 30:22 \ft See footnote at Vayyiqra 20:18.\f* thing. You shall tell it, "Go away!"
\p
\v 23 He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that day, your livestock will feed in large pastures.
\v 24 The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory fodder, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.
\v 25 There shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
\v 26 Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that יהוה binds up the fracture of His people, and heals the wound they were struck with.
\b
\q1
\v 27 Behold, the Name of יהוה comes from far away,
\q2 burning with His anger, and in thick rising smoke.
\q1 His lips are full of indignation,
\q2 and His tongue is as a devouring fire.
\q1
\v 28 His breath is as an overflowing wadi
\q2 that reaches even to the neck,
\q1 to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction;
\q2 and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples.
\b
\p
\v 29 You will have a song, as in the night when a set-apart Feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come to the mountain of יהוה, to Yisra'el's Rock.
\v 30 יהוה will cause His glorious voice to be heard, and will show the descent of His arm, with the indignation of His anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, storm, and hailstones.
\v 31 For through the voice of יהוה the Ashuwrite will be dismayed. He will strike him with His rod.
\v 32 Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which יהוה will lay on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons.
\v 33 For his burning place has long been ready. Yes, for the king it is prepared. He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. The breath of יהוה, like a wadi of sulfur, kindles it.
\c 31
\p
\q1
\v 1 Woe to those who go down to Mitsrayim for help,
\q2 and lean upon horses,
\q1 and rely on chariots because they are many,
\q2 and on horsemen because they are very strong,
\q1 but they do not look to the Set-apart One of Yisra'el,
\q2 and they do not seek יהוה!
\q1
\v 2 Yet He also is wise, and will bring disaster,
\q2 and will not call back His words,
\q1 but will arise against the house of the evildoers,
\q2 and against the help of those who work vain exertion.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Now the Mitsrites are men, and not El;
\q2 and their horses flesh, and not spirit.
\q1 When יהוה stretches out His hand,
\q2 both he who helps shall stumble,
\q1 and he who is helped shall fall,
\q2 and they all shall be consumed together.
\b
\q1
\v 4 For thus says יהוה to me,
\q2 "As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey,
\q3 if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,
\q2 will not be dismayed at their voice,
\q3 nor abase himself for the noise of them,
\q2 so יהוה Tsevaot will come down to fight
\q3 on Mount Tsion and on its heights.
\q1
\v 5 As birds hovering,
\q2 so יהוה Tsevaot will protect Yerushalayim.
\q1 He will protect and deliver it.
\q2 He will pass over and preserve it."
\b
\p
\v 6 Return to Him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Yisra'el.
\v 7 For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold—sin which your own hands have made for you.
\b
\q1
\v 8 "The Ashuwrite will fall by the sword \add that is\add* not of man;
\q2 and the sword \add that is\add* not of mankind shall devour him.
\q1 He will flee from the sword,
\q2 and his young men will become subject to forced labor.
\q1
\v 9 His rock will pass away by reason of terror,
\q2 and his princes will be afraid of the banner,"
\q1 says יהוה, whose fire is in Tsion,
\q2 and His furnace in Yerushalayim.
\c 32
\p
\q1
\v 1 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness,
\q2 and princes shall rule in judgment.
\q1
\v 2 A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind,
\q2 and a secret \add place\add* from the storm,
\q1 as streams of water in a dry place,
\q2 as the shade of a large rock in a weary land.
\q1
\v 3 The eyes of those who see will not be dim,
\q2 and the ears of those who hear will listen.
\q1
\v 4 The heart of the rash will understand knowledge,
\q2 and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.
\q1
\v 5 The fool will no longer be called noble,
\q2 nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
\q1
\v 6 For the senseless \add man\add* will speak senseless things,
\q2 and his heart will work vain exertion,
\q1 to practice profanity,
\q2 and to utter error against יהוה,
\q1 to make empty the being of the hungry,
\q2 and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
\q1
\v 7 The ways of the scoundrel are evil.
\q2 He devises lewdness
\q1 to destroy the humble with lying speeches,
\q2 even when the needy speaks judgment.
\q1
\v 8 But the noble devises noble things;
\q2 and he will continue in noble things.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Rise up, you women who are at ease!
\q2 Hear my voice!
\q1 You secure daughters,
\q2 give ear to my speeches!
\q1
\v 10 For days beyond a year you will be troubled,
\q2 you secure women;
\q1 for the vintage \add wine\add* shall fail.
\q2 The harvest will not come.
\q1
\v 11 Tremble, you women who are at ease!
\q2 Be troubled, you secure ones!
\q1 Strip yourselves, make yourselves naked,
\q2 and put sackcloth on your loins.
\q1
\v 12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,
\q2 for the fruitful vine.
\q1
\v 13 Thorns and briars will come up on my people's land;
\q2 yes, on all the houses of joy in the joyous city.
\q1
\v 14 For the palace will be forsaken.
\q2 The populous city will be deserted.
\q1 The hill and the watchtower
\q2 will be for dens forever,
\q1 a delight for wild donkeys,
\q2 a pasture of flocks;
\q1
\v 15 Until the Ruaḥ is poured on us from on high,
\q2 and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,
\q2 and the fruitful field is considered a forest.
\q1
\v 16 Then judgment will dwell in the wilderness;
\q2 and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field.
\q1
\v 17 The service of righteousness will be peace;
\q2 and the effect of righteousness, quietness and security forever.
\q1
\v 18 My people will live in a peaceful habitation,
\q2 in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting places.
\q1
\v 19 Though hail flattens the forest,
\q2 and the city is leveled completely.
\q1
\v 20 Blessed are you who sow beside all waters,
\q2 who send out the feet of the ox and the donkey.
\c 33
\p
\q1
\v 1 Woe to you who destroy,
\q2 but you were not destroyed;
\q1 and who deceive,
\q2 but nobody deceived you!
\q1 When you have finished destroying,
\q2 you will be destroyed;
\q1 and when you have finished deceiving,
\q2 you will be deceived.
\b
\q1
\v 2 יהוה, show favor to us.
\q2 We have waited for You.
\q1 Be our strength every morning,
\q2 our salvation also in the time of trouble.
\q1
\v 3 At the noise of the thunder,
\q2 the peoples have fled.
\q1 When You lift Yourself up,
\q2 the nations are scattered.
\q1
\v 4 Your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers.
\q2 Men will leap on it as locusts leap.
\b
\q1
\v 5 יהוה is exalted, for He dwells on high.
\q2 He has filled Tsion with judgment and righteousness.
\q1
\v 6 There will be faithfulness in Your times,
\q2 abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.
\q2 The fear of יהוה – this \add is\add* His treasure.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Behold, their valiant ones cry outside;
\q2 the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
\q1
\v 8 The highways are desolate.
\q2 The traveling man ceases.
\q1 The covenant is broken.
\q2 He has despised the cities.\f + \fr 33:8 \ft DSS reads, "its witnesses" instead of "the cities" here.\f*
\q2 He does not respect man.
\q1
\v 9 The land mourns and withers.
\q2 Levanon is confounded and rots.
\q1 Sharon is like a desert,
\q2 and Bashan and Karmel are stripped bare.
\b
\q1
\v 10 "Now I will arise," says יהוה;
\q2 "Now I will lift Myself up.
\q2 Now I will be exalted.
\q1
\v 11 You will conceive chaff. You will bring forth stubble.
\q2 Your breath is a fire that will devour you.
\q1
\v 12 The peoples will be like the burning of lime,
\q2 like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Hear, you who are far off, what I have done;
\q2 and, you who are near, acknowledge My might."
\q1
\v 14 The sinners in Tsion are afraid.
\q2 Trembling has seized the profane ones.
\q1 Who among us can live with the devouring fire?
\q2 Who among us can live with everlasting burning?
\q1
\v 15 He who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly;
\q2 he who despises the gain of oppressions,
\q1 who gestures with his hands,
\q2 refusing to take a bribe,
\q1 who stops his ears from hearing of blood,
\q2 and shuts his eyes from looking at evil—
\q1
\v 16 he will dwell on high.
\q2 His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks.
\q1 His bread will be supplied.
\q2 His waters will be faithful.
\b
\q1
\v 17 Your eyes will see the King in His beauty.
\q2 They will see a distant land.
\q1
\v 18 Your heart will meditate on the terror.
\q2 Where is he who counted?
\q1 Where is he who weighed?
\q2 Where is he who counted the towers?
\q1
\v 19 You will no longer see the fierce people,
\q2 a people of deeper speech than you can perceive,
\q2 with a mocking tongue you cannot understand.
\q1
\v 20 Look at Tsion, the city of our appointed time.
\q2 Your eyes will see Yerushalayim,
\q2 a quiet habitation, a tent that will not be removed.
\q1 Its stakes will never be plucked up,
\q2 nor will any of its cords be broken.
\q1
\v 21 But there יהוה will be with us in majesty,
\q2 a place of broad rivers and streams,
\q1 in which no galley with oars will go,
\q2 neither will any gallant ship pass by there.
\q1
\v 22 For יהוה is our Judge.
\q2 יהוה is our Lawgiver.
\q1 יהוה is our King.
\q2 He will save us.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Your rigging is untied.
\q2 They could not strengthen the foot of their mast.
\q2 They could not spread the sail.
\q1 Then the prey of a great spoil was divided.
\q2 The lame plundered the plunder.
\q1
\v 24 The inhabitant will not say, "I am sick."
\q2 The people who dwell therein will be forgiven their iniquity.
\c 34
\p
\q1
\v 1 Come near, you nations, to hear!
\q2 Listen, you peoples.
\q1 Let the earth and all it contains hear;
\q2 the world, and everything that comes from it.
\q1
\v 2 For יהוה is enraged against all the nations,
\q2 and angry with all their armies.
\q1 He has utterly destroyed them.
\q2 He has given them over for slaying.
\q1
\v 3 Their slain will also be cast out,
\q2 and the stench of their dead bodies will come up;
\q2 and the mountains will melt in their blood.
\q1
\v 4 All of the army of the heavens will be dissolved.
\q2 The heavens will be rolled up like a scroll,
\q1 and all its armies will fade away,
\q2 as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.
\b
\q1
\v 5 For My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens.
\q2 Behold, it will come down on Edom,
\q2 and on the people of My curse, for judgment.
\q1
\v 6 The sword of יהוה is filled with blood.
\q2 It is covered with fat,
\q1 with the blood of lambs and goats,
\q2 with the fat of the kidneys of rams;
\q1 for יהוה has a sacrifice in Botsrah,
\q2 and a great slaying in the land of Edom.
\q1
\v 7 The wild oxen will come down with them,
\q2 and the young bulls with the mighty bulls;
\q1 and their land will be drunken with blood,
\q2 and their dust made greasy with fat.
\b
\q1
\v 8 For יהוה has a day of vengeance,
\q2 a year of reward for the cause of Tsion.
\q1
\v 9 Its wadis will be turned into pitch,
\q2 its dust into sulfur,
\q2 and its land will become burning pitch.
\q1
\v 10 It will not be quenched night nor day.
\q2 Its smoke will go up forever.
\q1 From generation to generation, it will lie waste.
\q2 No one will pass through it forever and ever.
\q1
\v 11 But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.
\q2 The owl and the raven will dwell in it.

\v 12 They shall call its nobles to the kingdom,

\v 13 Thorns will come up in its palaces,

\v 15 The arrow snake will make her nest there,
\q2 and lay, hatch, and gather under her shade.
\q1 Yes, the kites will be gathered there,

\v 16 Search in the book of יהוה, and read:
\q2 not one of these will be missing;
\q2 none will lack her mate.
\q1 For my mouth has commanded,
\q2 and His Ruaḥ has gathered them.
\q1
\v 17 He has cast the lot for them,
\q2 and His hand has divided it to them with a measuring line.
\q1 They shall possess it forever.
\q2 From generation to generation they will dwell in it.
\c 35
\p
\q1
\v 1 The wilderness and the dry land will be glad.
\q2 The desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
\q1
\v 2 It will blossom abundantly,
\q2 and rejoice even with joy and singing.
\q1 Levanon's glory will be given to it,
\q2 the excellence of Karmel and Sharon.
\q1 They will see the glory of יהוה,
\q2 the excellence of our Elohim.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Strengthen the weak hands,
\q2 and make firm the feeble knees.

\v 4 Tell those who have a fearful heart,
\q2 "Be strong. Do not be afraid.
\q1 Behold, your Elohim will come with vengeance,
\q2 the retribution of Elohim.
\q2 He will come and save you.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,
\q2 and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.

\v 6 Then the lame man will leap like a deer,
\q2 and the tongue of the mute will sing;
\q1 for waters will break out in the wilderness,
\q2 and wadis in the desert.
\q1
\v 7 The burning sand will become a pool,
\q2 and the thirsty ground springs of water.
\q1 Grass with reeds and rushes
\q2 will be in the habitation of monsters,\f + \fr 35:7 \fk Monsters \ft See footnote at Yeshayahu 13:22.\f* where they lay.

\q1
\v 8 A highway will be there, a road,
\q2 and it will be called The Set-apart Way.
\q1 The unclean shall not pass over it,
\q2 but it will be for those who walk in the Way.
\q1 Wicked fools will not go there.
\q2
\v 9 No lion will be there,
\q2 nor will any ravenous animal go up on it.
\q1 They will not be found there;
\q2 but the redeemed will walk there.
\q1
\v 10 The ransomed ones of יהוה will return,
\q2 and come with singing to Tsion;
\q1 and everlasting joy will be on their heads.
\q2 They will obtain gladness and joy,
\q2 and sorrow and sighing will flee away."

\p
\v 1 Now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Ḥizqiyahu, that Sanḥeriv king of Ashuwr attacked all of the fortified cities of Yehudah, and captured them.
\v 2 The king of Ashuwr sent Rabshakeh from Lakish to Yerushalayim to king Ḥizqiyahu with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller's field highway.
\v 3 Then Elyaqim the son of Ḥilqiyahu, who was over the household, and Shevna the scribe, and Yoaḥ, the son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him.
\p
\v 4 Rabshakeh said to them, "Now tell Ḥizqiyahu, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Ashuwr, "What confidence is this on which you rely?
\v 5 I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?
\v 6 Behold, you rely on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Mitsrayim, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim to all who rely on him.
\v 7 But if you tell me, 'We rely on יהוה our Elohim,' is that not He whose high places and whose altars Ḥizqiyahu has taken away, and has said to Yehudah and to Yerushalayim, 'You shall bow down before this altar'?"
\v 8 Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Ashuwr, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
\v 9 How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and rely on Mitsrayim for chariots and for horsemen?
\v 10 Have I come up now without יהוה against this land to destroy it? יהוה said to me, "Go up against this land, and destroy it."'"
\p
\v 11 Then Elyaqim, Shevna and Yoaḥ said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in the Yehudite language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
\v 12 But Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?"
\p
\v 13 Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Yehudite language, and said, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Ashuwr!
\v 14 Thus says the king, 'Do not let Ḥizqiyahu deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you.
\v 15 Do not let Ḥizqiyahu make you rely on יהוה, saying, "יהוה will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Ashuwr."'
\v 16 Do not listen to Ḥizqiyahu, for thus says the king of Ashuwr, 'Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;
\v 17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
\v 18 Beware lest Ḥizqiyahu persuade you, saying, "יהוה will deliver us." Have any of the elohim of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Ashuwr?
\v 19 Where are the elohim of Ḥamath and Arpad? Where are the elohim of Sepharvayim? Have they delivered Shom'ron from my hand?
\v 20 Who are they among all the elohim of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that יהוה should deliver Yerushalayim out of my hand?'"
\p
\v 21 But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
\v 22 Then Elyaqim the son of Ḥilqiyahu, who was over the household, and Shevna the scribe, and Yoaḥ, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Ḥizqiyahu with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
\c 37
\p
\v 1 It happened, when king Ḥizqiyahu heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of יהוה.
\v 2 He sent Elyaqim, who was over the household, and Shevna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Yeshayahu the prophet, the son of Amots.
\v 3 They said to him, "Thus says Ḥizqiyahu, 'This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.
\v 4 It may be יהוה your Elohim will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Ashuwr his master has sent to defy the living Elohim, and will rebuke the words which יהוה your Elohim has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.'"
\p
\v 5 So the servants of king Ḥizqiyahu came to Yeshayahu.
\v 6 Yeshayahu said to them, "Tell your master, 'Thus says יהוה, "Do not be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Ashuwr have blasphemed Me.
\v 7 Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."'"
\p
\v 8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Ashuwr warring against Livnah, for he had heard that he was departed from Lakish.
\v 9 He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Kush, "He has come out to fight against you." When he heard it, he sent messengers to Ḥizqiyahu, saying,
\v 10 "Thus you shall speak to Ḥizqiyahu king of Yehudah, saying, 'Do not let your Elohim on whom you rely deceive you, saying, "Yerushalayim will not be given into the hand of the king of Ashuwr."
\v 11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Ashuwr have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered?
\v 12 Have the elohim of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Ḥaran, Retseph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?
\v 13 Where is the king of Ḥamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvayim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'"
\p
\v 14 Ḥizqiyahu received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Ḥizqiyahu went up to the house of יהוה, and spread it before יהוה.
\v 15 Ḥizqiyahu prayed to יהוה, saying,
\v 16 "יהוה Tsevaot, the Elohim of Yisra'el, who is enthroned among the keruvim, You are the Elohim, even You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.
\v 17 Turn Your ear, יהוה, and hear. Open Your eyes, יהוה, and behold. Hear all of the words of Sanḥeriv, who has sent to defy the living Elohim.
\v 18 Truly, יהוה, the kings of Ashuwr have destroyed all the countries and their land,
\v 19 and have cast their elohim into the fire; for they were no elohim, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
\v 20 Now therefore, יהוה our Elohim, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are יהוה, even You only."
\p
\v 21 Then Yeshayahu the son of Amots sent to Ḥizqiyahu, saying, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'Because you have prayed to Me against Sanḥeriv king of Ashuwr,
\v 22 this is the word which יהוה has spoken concerning him.
\b
\q1 The virgin daughter of Tsion has despised you and ridiculed you.
\q2 The daughter of Yerushalayim has shaken her head at you.
\q1
\b
\v 23 Whom have you defied and blasphemed?
\q2 Against whom have you exalted your voice
\q1 and lifted up your eyes on high?
\q2 Against the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\q1
\v 24 "By your servants, have you defied יהוה,
\q2 and have said, 'With the multitude of my chariots
\q1 I have come up to the height of the mountains,
\q2 to the innermost parts of Levanon.
\q1 I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice fir trees.
\q2 I will enter into its farthest height,
\q2 the forest of its fruitful field.
\q1
\v 25 I have dug and drunk water,
\q2 and with the sole of my feet
\q2 I will dry up all the rivers of Mitsrayim.'
\b
\q1
\v 26 "Have you not heard how I have done it long ago,
\q2 and formed it in ancient times?
\q1 Now I have brought it to pass,
\q2 that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities,
\q2 turning them into ruinous heaps.
\q1
\v 27 Therefore their inhabitants had little power.
\q2 They were dismayed and confounded.
\q1 They were like the grass of the field,
\q2 and like the green herb,
\q1 like the grass on the housetops,
\q2 and like a field before its crop has grown.\f + \fr 37:27 \ft DSS, some Masoretic Hebrew manuscripts and some LXX Manuscripts read, "Scorched before it grows up" instead of "Like a field before its crop has grown."\f*
\b
\q1
\v 28 "But I know your sitting down,
\q2 your going out, your coming in,
\q2 and your raging against Me.
\q1
\v 29 Because of your raging against Me,
\q2 and because your arrogance has come up into My ears,
\q1 therefore will I put My hook in your nose
\q2 and My bridle in your lips,
\q1 and I will turn you back
\q2 by the way by which you came.
\b
\p
\v 30 "This shall be the sign to you. You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from the same; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
\v 31 The remnant that is escaped of the house of Yehudah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\v 32 For out of Yerushalayim a remnant will go forth, and survivors will escape from Mount Tsion. The zeal of יהוה Tsevaot will perform this.
\p
\v 33 "Therefore thus says יהוה concerning the king of Ashuwr, 'He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
\v 34 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come to this city,' says יהוה.
\v 35 'For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake, and for My servant David's sake.'"
\p
\v 36 The messenger of יהוה went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Ashuwrites. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
\v 37 So Sanḥeriv king of Ashuwr departed, went away, returned to Nineveh, and stayed there.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 It happened, as he was bowing down in the house of Nisrok his el, that Adrammelekh and Sharetser his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar-Ḥaddon his son reigned in his place.
\p
\v 38 In those days was Ḥizqiyahu sick and near death. Yeshayahu the prophet, the son of Amots, came to him, and said to him, "Thus says יהוה, 'Set your house in order, for you will die, and not live.'"
\v 2 Then Ḥizqiyahu turned his face to the wall and prayed to יהוה,
\v 3 and said, "Remember now, יהוה, I beg You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in Your eyes." Ḥizqiyahu wept bitterly.
\p
\v 4 Then the word of יהוה came to Yeshayahu, saying,
\v 5 "Go, and tell Ḥizqiyahu, 'Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of David your father, "I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
\v 6 I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Ashuwr, and I will defend this city.
\p
\v 7 This shall be the sign to you from יהוה, that יהוה will do this thing that he has spoken.
\v 8 Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Aḥaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down."'"
\p
\v 9 The writing of Ḥizqiyahu king of Yehudah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness.
\p
\v 10 I said, "In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol. I am deprived of the residue of my years."
\v 11 I said, "I will not see Yah, \add even\add* Yah in the land of the living. I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
\v 12 My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me like a shepherd's tent. I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life. He will cut me off from the loom. From day even to night You will put an end to me.
\v 13 I waited patiently until morning. He breaks all my bones like a lion. From day even to night you will put an end to me.
\v 14 I chattered like a swallow or a crane. I moaned like a dove. My eyes weaken looking upward. יהוה, I am oppressed. Be my security."
\v 15 What will I say? He has both spoken to me, and Himself has done it. I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my being.
\p
\v 16 יהוה, men live by these things; and my spirit finds life in all of them: You restore me, and cause me to live.
\v 17 Behold, for peace I had great anguish, but You have in love for my being delivered it from the pit of corruption; for You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
\v 18 For Sheol cannot praise You. Death cannot celebrate You. Those who go down into the pit cannot hope for Your truth.
\v 19 The living, the living, he shall praise You, as I do today. The father shall make known Your truth to the children.
\v 20 יהוה will save me. Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of יהוה.
\p
\v 21 Now Yeshayahu had said, "Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover."
\v 22 Ḥizqiyahu also had said, "What is the sign that I will go up to the house of יהוה?"
\c 39
\p
\v 1 At that time, Merodak Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Bavel, sent letters and a present to Ḥizqiyahu; for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.
\v 2 Ḥizqiyahu was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Ḥizqiyahu did not show them.
\p
\v 3 Then Yeshayahu the prophet came to king Ḥizqiyahu, and asked him, "What did these men say? Where did they come from to you?" Ḥizqiyahu said, "They have come from a country far from me, even from Bavel."
\v 4 Then he asked, "What have they seen in your house?" Ḥizqiyahu answered, "They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."
\p
\v 5 Then Yeshayahu said to Ḥizqiyahu, "Hear the word of יהוה Tsevaot:
\v 6 'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried to Bavel. Nothing will be left,' says יהוה.
\v 7 'They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king of Bavel's palace.'"
\v 8 Then Ḥizqiyahu said to Yeshayahu, "The word of יהוה which you have spoken is good." He said moreover, "For there will be peace and truth in my days."
\c 40
\p
\v 1 "Comfort, comfort My people," says your Elohim.
\v 2 "Speak \add from the\add* heart to Yerushalayim; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of the hand of יהוה double for all her sins."
\p
\v 3 The voice of one who calls out, "Prepare the way of יהוה in the wilderness! Make straight the highway in the desert for our Elohim.\f + \fr 40:3 \ft LXX reads, "Make straight paths for our Elohim." See also Markos 1:3 and Matityahu 3:3.\f*
\v 4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low. The uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain.
\v 5 The glory of יהוה shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of יהוה has spoken it."
\p
\v 6 The voice of one saying, "Cry!" One said, "What shall I cry?" "All flesh is like grass, and all its loving-kindness is like the flower of the field.
\v 7 The grass withers, the flower fades, because the breath of יהוה blows on it. Surely the people are like grass.
\v 8 The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our Elohim stands forever."
\p
\v 9 You who tell good news to Tsion, go up on a high mountain. You who tell good news to Yerushalayim, lift up your voice with strength. Lift it up. Do not be afraid. Say to the cities of Yehudah, "Behold, your Elohim!"
\v 10 Behold, Adonai יהוה will come as a mighty one, and His arm will rule for Him. Behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.
\v 11 He will feed His flock like a shepherd. He will gather the lambs in His arm, and carry them in His bosom. He will gently lead those who have their young.
\p
\v 12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and marked off the heavens with His span, and calculated the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
\v 13 Who has directed the Ruaḥ of יהוה, or has taught Him as His counselor?
\v 14 Who did He take counsel with, and who instructed Him, and taught Him in the path of judgment, and taught Him knowledge, and showed Him the way of understanding?
\p
\v 15 Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance. Behold, He lifts up the islands like a very little thing.
\v 16 Levanon is not sufficient to burn, nor its animals sufficient for an ascension offering.
\v 17 All the nations are like nothing before Him. They are regarded by Him as less than nothing, and vanity.
\p
\v 18 To whom then will you liken El? Or what likeness will you compare to Him?
\v 19 A workman has cast an image, and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts silver chains for it.
\v 20 He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot. He seeks a skillful workman to set up an engraved image for him that will not be moved.
\v 21 Have you not known? Have you not heard, yet? Have you not been told from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
\p
\v 22 It is He who sits above the circuit of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;
\v 23 who brings princes to nothing; who makes the judges of the earth like meaningless.
\v 24 They are planted scarcely. They are sown scarcely. Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground. He merely blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.
\p
\v 25 "To whom then will you liken Me? Who is My equal?" says the Set-apart One.
\v 26 Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these, who brings out their army by number. He calls them all by name. By the greatness of His might, and because He is strong in power, not one is lacking.
\p
\v 27 Why do you say, Ya'aqov, and speak, Yisra'el, "My way is hidden from יהוה, and the judgment due me is disregarded by my Elohim?"
\v 28 Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting Elohim, יהוה, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint. He is not weary. His understanding is unsearchable.
\v 29 He gives power to the weak. He increases the strength of him who has no might.
\v 30 Even the youths faint and get weary, and the young men utterly fall;
\v 31 But those who wait for יהוה will renew their strength. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run, and not be weary. They will walk, and not faint.
\c 41
\p
\v 1 "Keep silent before Me, islands, and let the peoples renew their strength. Let them come near, then let them speak. Let Us meet together for judgment.
\v 2 Who has raised up one from the east? Who called him to His foot in righteousness? He hands over nations to him, and makes him rule over kings. He gives them like the dust to his sword, like the driven stubble to his bow.
\v 3 He pursues them, and passes by safely, Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.
\p
\v 4 Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, יהוה, the first, the last, I am He."
\p
\v 5 The islands have seen, and fear. The ends of the earth tremble. They approach, and come.
\v 6 Everyone helps his neighbor. They say to their brothers, "Be strong!"
\v 7 So the carpenter strengthens the goldsmith. He who smoothes with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, "It is good;" and he fastens it with nails, that it might not totter.
\p
\v 8 "But you, Yisra'el, My servant, Ya'aqov whom I have chosen, the seed of Avraham My friend,
\v 9 You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from its corners, and said to you, 'You are My servant, I have chosen you and not cast you away;
\v 10 Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Do not be dismayed, for I am your Elohim. I will strengthen you. Yes, I will help you. Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness.
\v 11 Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded. Those who strive with you will be like nothing, and shall perish.
\v 12 You will seek them, and will not find them, even those who contend with you. Those who war against you will be as nothing, as a non-existent thing.
\p
\v 13 "For I, יהוה your Elohim, will hold your right hand, saying to you, 'Do not be afraid. I will help you.'
\v 14 Do not be afraid, you worm Ya'aqov, and you men of Yisra'el. I will help you," says יהוה, "and your Redeemer is the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\v 15 Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth. You will thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and will make the hills like chaff.
\v 16 You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, and the whirlwind will scatter them. You will rejoice in יהוה. You will glory in the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 17 The poor and needy seek water, and there is none. Their tongue fails for thirst. I, יהוה, will answer them. I, the Elohim of Yisra'el, will not forsake them.
\v 18 I will open rivers on the bare heights, and springs in the midst of the valleys. I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
\p
\v 19 I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness. I will set fir trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;
\v 20 that they may see, know, consider, and understand together, that the hand of יהוה has done this, and the Set-apart One of Yisra'el has created it.
\p
\v 21 "Produce your cause," says יהוה. "Bring forth your strong reasons," says the King of Ya'aqov.
\v 22 "Let them announce, and declare to us what shall happen. Declare the former things, what they are, that we may \add take them\add* to heart, and know the latter end of them; or show us things to come.
\v 23 Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are elohim. Yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and see it together.
\v 24 Behold, you are of nothing, and your work is of nothing. He who chooses you is an abomination.
\v 25 I have raised up one from the north, and he has come; from the rising of the sun, one who calls on My Name; and he shall come on rulers as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay.
\v 26 Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know? And before, that we may say, 'He is right?' Surely, there is no one who declares. Surely, there is no one who shows. Surely, there is no one who hears your speeches.
\v 27 I am the first to say to Tsion, 'Behold, look at them;' and I will give one who brings good news to Yerushalayim.
\v 28 When I look, there is no man; even among them there is no counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.
\v 29 Behold, all of them, their works are vain exertion and nothing. Their molten images are wind and confusion.
\c 42
\p
\v 1 "Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold; My Chosen, in whom My being delights— I have put My Ruaḥ on Him. He will bring judgment to the nations.
\v 2 He will not shout, nor raise His voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street.
\v 3 He will not break a bruised reed. He will not quench a dimly burning wick. He will bring judgment to truth.
\v 4 He will not fail nor be discouraged, until He has set judgment in the earth, and the islands will wait for His Torah."
\p
\v 5 Thus says El יהוה, He who created the heavens and stretched them out, He who spread out the earth and that which comes out of it, He who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it:
\v 6 "I, יהוה, have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will preserve You, and give You for a covenant for the people, as a Light for the nations;
\v 7 to open the blind eyes, to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.
\p
\v 8 "I am יהוה. That is My Name. I will not give My glory to another, nor My praise to engraved images.
\v 9 Behold, the former things have happened, and I declare new things. I tell you about them before they come up."
\p
\v 10 Sing to יהוה a new song, and His praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the islands and their inhabitants.
\v 11 Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices, with the villages that Qedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Selah sing. Let them shout from the top of the mountains!
\v 12 Let them give glory to יהוה, and declare His praise in the islands.
\p
\v 13 יהוה will go out like a mighty man. He will stir up zeal like a man of war. He will raise a war cry. Yes, He will shout aloud. He will triumph over His enemies.
\p
\v 14 "I have been silent a long time. I have been quiet and restrained Myself. Now I will cry out like a travailing woman. I will both gasp and pant.
\v 15 I will destroy mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs. I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.
\v 16 I will bring the blind by a way that they do not know. I will lead them in paths that they do not know. I will make darkness \add as\add* light before them, and crooked places straight. I will do these things, and I will not forsake them.
\v 17 Those who rely on engraved images, who tell molten images, 'You are our elohim' will be turned back. They will be utterly disappointed.
\v 18 Hear, you deaf, and look, you blind, that you may see.
\v 19 Who is blind, but My servant? Or who is as deaf as My messenger whom I send? Who is as blind as he who is at peace, and as blind as the servant of יהוה?
\v 20 You see many things, but do not guard. His ears are open, but he does not listen.\f + \fr 42:20 \ft Hebrew word rendered as "hear" is שמע (sh'ma) here. See footnote at Devarim 6:4.\f*
\v 21 It pleased יהוה, for His righteousness' sake, to magnify the Torah, and make it majestic.
\v 22 But this is a despoiled and plundered people. All of them are snared in holes, and they are hidden in prisons. They have become a plunder, and no one delivers; and a spoil, and no one says, 'Restore \add them\add*!'
\p
\v 23 Who is there among you who will give ear to this? Who will listen and hear for the time to come?
\v 24 Who gave Ya'aqov as plunder, and Yisra'el to the robbers? Did not יהוה, He against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk in His ways, and they disobeyed His Torah.
\v 25 Therefore He poured the fierceness of His anger on him, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire all around, but he did not know; and it burned him, but he did not take it to heart."
\c 43
\p
\v 1 But now thus says יהוה who created you, Ya'aqov, and He who formed you, Yisra'el: "Do not be afraid, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by your name. You are Mine.
\v 2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned, and flame will not scorch you.
\v 3 For I am יהוה your Elohim, the Set-apart One of Yisra'el, your Savior. I have given Mitsrayim as your ransom, Kush and Seva in your place.
\v 4 Since you have been precious and honored in My sight, and I have loved you; therefore I will give people in your place, and nations instead of your being.
\p
\v 5 Do not be afraid; for I am with you. I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west.
\v 6 I will tell the north, 'Give them up!' and tell the south, 'Do not hold them back! Bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the ends of the earth—
\v 7 everyone who is called by My Name, and whom I have created for My glory, whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made.'"
\p
\v 8 Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.
\v 9 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled. Who among them can declare this, and show us former things? Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be declared right; or let them hear, and say, "That is true."
\p
\v 10 "You are My witnesses," says יהוה, "With My servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and trust Me, and understand that I am He. Before Me there was no El formed, neither will there be after Me.
\v 11 I Myself am יהוה; and besides Me there is no saving one.
\v 12 I have declared, I have saved, and I have shown; and there was no strange \add el\add* among you. Therefore you are My witnesses," says יהוה, "and I am El.
\v 13 Yes, since the day was I am He; and there is no one who can deliver out of My hand. I will work, and who can hinder it?"
\p
\v 14 Thus says יהוה, your Redeemer, the Set-apart One of Yisra'el: "For your sake, I have sent to Bavel, and I will bring all of them down as fugitives, even the Kaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.
\v 15 I am יהוה, your Set-apart One, the Creator of Yisra'el, your King."
\p
\v 16 Thus says יהוה, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
\v 17 who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched like a wick):
\v 18 "Do not remember the former things, and do not consider the things of old.
\v 19 Behold, I will do a new thing. It springs forth now. Do you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
\v 20 The animals of the field shall honor Me, the monsters\f + \fr 43:20 \fk Monsters \ft See footnote at Yeshayahu 13:22.\f* and the ostriches; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen,
\v 21 the people which I formed for Myself, that they might set forth My praise.
\v 22 Yet you have not called on Me, Ya'aqov; but you have been weary of Me, Yisra'el.
\p
\v 23 You have not brought Me of your sheep for ascension offerings; neither have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, nor wearied you with frankincense.
\v 24 You have bought Me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened Me with your sins. You have wearied Me with your iniquities.
\v 25 I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and I will not remember your sins.
\v 26 Put Me in remembrance. Let us judge together. Set forth your case, that you may be declared right.
\p
\v 27 Your first father sinned, and your teachers have transgressed against Me.
\v 28 Therefore I will profane the princes of the set-apart place; and I will make Ya'aqov a curse, and Yisra'el an insult."
\c 44
\p
\v 1 Yet listen now, Ya'aqov My servant, and Yisra'el, whom I have chosen.
\v 2 This is what יהוה who made you, and formed you from the womb, who will help you says: "Do not be afraid, Ya'aqov My servant; and you, Yeshurun, whom I have chosen.
\v 3 For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and streams on the dry ground. I will pour My Ruaḥ on your seed, and My blessing on your offspring:
\v 4 and they will spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.
\v 5 One will say, 'I belong to יהוה;' and another will be called by the name of Ya'aqov; and another will write with his hand 'to יהוה,' and honor the name of Yisra'el."
\p
\v 6 This is what יהוה, the King of Yisra'el, and his Redeemer, יהוה Tsevaot, says: "I am the first, and I am the last; and besides Me there is no Elohim.
\v 7 Who is like Me? Who will call, and will declare it, and set it in order for Me, since I established the ancient people? Let them declare the things that are coming, and that will happen.
\v 8 Do not fear, neither be afraid. Have I not declared it to you long ago, and shown it? You are My witnesses. Is there an Eloah besides Me? Indeed, there is not. I do not know any other Rock."
\p
\v 9 Everyone who makes an engraved image is vain. The things that they delight in will not profit. Their own witnesses do not see, nor know, that they may be disappointed.
\v 10 Who has fashioned an el, or molds an image that is profitable for nothing?
\v 11 Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed; and the workmen are mere men. Let them all be gathered together. Let them stand up. They will fear. They will be put to shame together.
\p
\v 12 The blacksmith takes an axe, works in the coals, fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm. He is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is faint.
\v 13 The carpenter stretches out a line. He marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes. He marks it out with compasses, and shapes it like the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to reside in a house.
\v 14 He cuts down cedars for himself, and takes the cypress and the oak, and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir tree, and the rain nourishes it.
\v 15 Then it will be for a man to burn; and he takes some of it, and warms himself. Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread. Yes, he makes an el, and prostrates himself before it; he makes it an engraved image, and bows down to it.
\v 16 He burns part of it in the fire. With part of it, he eats meat. He roasts a roast, and is satisfied. Yes, he warms himself, and says, "Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire."
\v 17 The rest of it he makes into an el, even his engraved image. He prostrates himself before it and bows down, and prays to it, and says, "Deliver me; for you are my el!"
\p
\v 18 They do not know, neither do they consider: for he has shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
\v 19 No one thinks, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, "I have burned part of it in the fire. Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals. I have roasted meat and eaten it. Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination? Shall I prostrate \add myself\add* before a tree trunk?"
\v 20 He feeds on ashes. A deceived heart has turned him aside; and he cannot deliver his being, nor say, "Is there not a lie in my right hand?"
\p
\v 21 Remember these things, Ya'aqov and Yisra'el; for you are My servant. I have formed you. You are My servant. Yisra'el, you will not be forgotten by Me.
\v 22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.
\v 23 Sing, you heavens, for יהוה has done it! Shout, you lower parts of the earth! Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees, for יהוה has redeemed Ya'aqov, and will glorify Himself in Yisra'el.
\p
\v 24 Thus says יהוה, your Redeemer, and He who formed you from the womb: "I am יהוה, who makes all things; who alone stretches out the heavens; who spreads out the earth by Myself;
\v 25 who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad; who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;
\v 26 who confirms the word of His servant, and performs the counsel of His messengers; who says of Yerushalayim, 'She will be inhabited;' and of the cities of Yehudah, 'They will be built,' and 'I will raise up its waste places;'
\v 27 who says to the deep, 'Be dry,' and 'I will dry up your rivers;'
\v 28 Who says of Koresh, 'He is My shepherd, and shall perform all My pleasure,' even saying of Yerushalayim, 'She will be built;' and of the Temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"
\c 45
\p
\v 1 Thus says יהוה to His anointed, to Koresh,\f + \fr 45:1 \fk Koresh \ft Commonly translated as "Cyrus." This refers to the king of Paras who allowed Ezra to return and rebuild the Temple.\f* whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him, and strip kings of their armor; to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut:
\v 2 "I will go before you, and make the rough places smooth.\f + \fr 45:2 \ft LXX and DSS read, "I will level mountains" instead of "make the rough places smooth." Syr. reads, "I will loose the loins of kings." Lat. reads, "I will humble the great ones of the earth."\f* I will break the doors of copper in pieces, and cut apart the bars of iron.
\v 3 I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that it is I, יהוה, who call you by your name, even the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\v 4 For Ya'aqov My servant's sake, and Yisra'el My chosen, I have called you by your name. I have surnamed you, though you have not known Me.
\v 5 I am יהוה, and there is none else. Besides Me, there is no Elohim. I will strengthen you, though you have not known Me;
\v 6 that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides Me. I am יהוה, and there is no one else.
\p
\v 7 I form the light, and create darkness. I make peace, and create calamity. I am יהוה, who does all these things.
\v 8 Distil, you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness. Let the earth open, that it may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it. I, יהוה, have created it.
\p
\v 9 Woe to him who strives with his Maker— a clay pot among the clay pots of the earth! Shall the clay ask him who fashions it, 'What are you making?' or your work, 'He has no hands?'
\p
\v 10 Woe to him who says to a father, 'What have you brought forth?' or to a mother, 'To what have you given birth?'"
\p
\v 11 Thus says יהוה, the Set-apart One of Yisra'el, and his Maker: "You ask Me about the things that are to come, concerning My sons, and you command Me concerning the work of My hands!
\v 12 I have made the earth, and created man on it. I, even My hands, have stretched out the heavens; and I have commanded all their army.
\v 13 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways. He shall build My city, and he shall let My exiles go free, not for price nor reward," says יהוה Tsevaot.
\p
\v 14 Thus says יהוה: "The labor of Mitsrayim, and the merchandise of Kush, and the Saveans, men of stature, shall come over to you, and they shall be yours. They will go after you. They shall come over in chains; and they will bow down to you. They will pray to you: 'Surely Elohim is in you; and there is none else. There is no other el.
\v 15 Most certainly You are El who has hidden Yourself, Elohim of Yisra'el, the Savior.'"
\p
\v 16 They will be disappointed, yes, confounded, all of them. Those who are makers of forms will go into confusion together.
\v 17 Yisra'el will be saved by יהוה with an everlasting salvation. You will not be disappointed nor confounded to ages everlasting.
\v 18 For thus says יהוה who created the heavens, the Elohim who formed the earth and made it, who established it and did not create it a waste, who formed it to be inhabited: "I am יהוה; and there is no other.
\v 19 I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness. I did not say to the seed of Ya'aqov, 'Seek Me in vain.' I, יהוה, speak righteousness. I declare things that are upright.
\v 20 Assemble yourselves and come. Draw near together, you who have escaped from the nations. Those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image, and pray to an el that cannot save.
\v 21 Declare and present it. Yes, let them take counsel together. Who has shown this from ancient time? Who has declared it of old? Have not I, יהוה? There is no other Elohim besides Me, a just El and a Savior; there is no one besides Me.
\v 22 Look to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am El, and there is no other.
\v 23 I have sworn by Myself, the word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness, and will not return, that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall take an oath.
\p
\v 24 They will say of me, 'There is righteousness and strength only in יהוה.'" Even to Him shall men come; and all those who were incensed against Him shall be disappointed.
\v 25 In יהוה shall all the seed of Yisra'el be declared right, and shall glory.
\c 46
\p
\v 1 Bel bows down, Nevo stoops; their idols are on the animals, and on the livestock: the things that you carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary \add animal\add*.
\v 2 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
\p
\v 3 "Listen to Me, house of Ya'aqov, and all the remnant of the house of Yisra'el, that have been borne \add by Me\add* from the belly, that have been carried from the womb;
\v 4 and even to old age I am He, and even to gray hairs will I carry you. I have made, and I will bear; yes, I will carry, and will deliver.
\v 5 "To whom will you liken Me, and make Me equal, and compare Me, that we may be like?
\v 6 Some pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver in the balance. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it an el. They prostrate \add themselves\add* — yes, they bow down.
\v 7 They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands, from its place it shall not move: yes, one may cry to it, yet it cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
\p
\v 8 "Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to heart, you transgressors.
\v 9 Remember the former things of old: for I am El, and there is none else; \add I am\add* Elohim, and there is none like Me;
\v 10 declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not \add yet\add* done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure;
\v 11 calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of My counsel from a far country; yes, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.
\p
\v 12 Listen to Me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:
\v 13 I bring near My righteousness, it shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not wait; and I will place salvation in Tsion for Yisra'el My glory.

\v 1 "Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Bavel; sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Kaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.
\p
\v 2 Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.
\v 3 Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man."
\p
\v 4 Our Redeemer, יהוה Tsevaot is His Name, the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 5 "Sit in silence, and go into darkness, daughter of the Kaldeans; for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.
\v 6 I was angry with My people, I profaned My inheritance, and gave them into your hand: you showed them no compassion; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke.
\v 7 You said, 'I shall be mistress forever'; so that you did not lay these things to your heart, neither did you\f + \fr 47:7 \ft DSS read, "I" instead of "you" here.\f* remember the latter end of it.
\p
\v 8 "Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, 'I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children':
\v 9 but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come on you, in the multitude of your sorceries, and the great abundance of your enchantments.
\v 10 For you have relied on your wickedness; you have said, 'No one sees me;' your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you, and you have said in your heart, 'I am, and there is none else besides me.'
\p
\v 11 Therefore evil will come on you; you will not know when it dawns: and disaster will fall on you; for which you cannot atone: and desolation shall come on you suddenly, which you do not know.
\p
\v 12 "Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.
\v 13 You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels: let now the astrologers, the stargazers, those who predict by the new moon, stand up, and save you from the things that shall come on you.
\p
\v 14 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.
\v 15 Thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored: those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter; there shall be none to save you.

\v 1 "Hear this, house of Ya'aqov, you who are called by the name of Yisra'el, and have come forth out of the waters of Yehudah; who swear by the Name of יהוה, and make mention of the Elohim of Yisra'el, but not in truth, nor in righteousness
\v 2 (for they call themselves of the set-apart city, and lean on the Elohim of Yisra'el; יהוה Tsevaot is His Name):
\v 3 I have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went forth out of My mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they happened.
\v 4 Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow \add is as\add* copper;
\v 5 therefore I have declared it to you from of old; before it came about I showed it to you, lest you should say, 'My idol has done them, and my engraved image, and my molten image, has commanded them.'
\p
\v 6 You have heard it; see all this; and you, will you not declare it? I have shown you new things from this time, even preserved things, which you have not known.
\v 7 They are created now, and not from of old; and before today you did not hear them; lest you should say, 'Behold, I knew them.'
\v 8 Yes, you did not hear; yes, you did not know; yes, from of old your ear was not opened: for I knew that you did deal very deceitfully, and was called a transgressor from the womb.
\v 9 For My Name's sake will I defer My anger, and for My praise will I refrain for you, that I not cut you off.
\p
\v 10 Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.
\v 11 For My own sake, for My own sake, will I do it; for how should \add My Name\add* be profaned? And My glory I will not give to another.
\p
\v 12 "Listen to Me, O Ya'aqov, and Yisra'el My called: I am He; I am the first, I also am the last.
\v 13 Yes, My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spread out the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together.
\p
\v 14 "Assemble yourselves, all you, and hear; who among them has declared these things? He whom יהוה loves shall perform His pleasure on Bavel, and His arm \add shall be on\add* the Kaldeans.
\v 15 I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
\p
\v 16 "Come near to Me and hear this: 'From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I. Now Adonai יהוה has sent me, with His Ruaḥ.'
\p
\v 17 Thus says יהוה, your Redeemer, the Set-apart One of Yisra'el: 'I am יהוה your Elohim, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.
\v 18 Oh that you had listened to My commands! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea;
\v 19 your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your gut like grains: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before Me.
\p
\v 20 Go forth from Bavel, flee from the Kaldeans; with a voice of singing declare, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say, יהוה has redeemed His servant Ya'aqov.
\v 21 They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
\v 22 There is no peace,' says יהוה, 'for the wicked.'"
\c 49
\p
\v 1 Listen, islands, to me; and listen, you peoples, from far: יהוה has called me from the womb; from the gut of my mother has He made mention of my name.
\v 2 And He has made my mouth like a sharp sword. In the shadow of His hand, He has hidden me, and He has made me a polished shaft. He has kept me close in His quiver.
\v 3 And He said to me, "You are My servant; Yisra'el, in whom I will be glorified."
\v 4 But I said, "I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely the judgment \add due\add* to me is with יהוה, and my reward with my Elohim."
\p
\v 5 Now says יהוה who formed me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Ya'aqov again to Him, and that Yisra'el be gathered to Him (for I am honorable in the eyes of יהוה, and my Elohim is become my strength);
\v 6 yes, He says, "It is too light a thing that you should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Ya'aqov, and to restore the preserved of Yisra'el: I will also give you for a light to the nations, that you may be My salvation to the end of the earth."
\p
\v 7 Thus says יהוה, the Redeemer of Yisra'el, \add and\add* his Set-apart One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers: "Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they shall bow down; because of יהוה who is faithful, \add even\add* the Set-apart One of Yisra'el, who has chosen you."
\p
\v 8 Thus says יהוה, "In an acceptable time have I answered you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you; and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage:
\v 9 saying to those who are bound, 'Come out!'; to those who are in darkness, 'Show yourselves!' "They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.
\v 10 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for He who has compassion on them will lead them, even by springs of water He will guide them.
\v 11 I will make all My mountains a way, and My highways shall be exalted.
\v 12 Behold, these shall come from far; and behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim."
\p
\v 13 Sing, heavens; and be joyful, earth; and break forth into singing, mountains: for יהוה has comforted His people, and will have compassion on His afflicted.
\v 14 But Tsion said, "יהוה has forsaken me, יהוה has forgotten me."
\p
\v 15 "Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, these may forget, yet I will not forget you!
\v 16 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands; your walls are continually before Me.
\v 17 Your children make haste; your destroyers and those who made you waste shall go forth from you.
\v 18 Lift up your eyes all around, and see: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live," says יהוה, "you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament, and dress yourself with them, like a bride.
\p
\v 19 "For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed, surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up shall be far away.
\v 20 The children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, 'The place is too small for me; give place to me that I may dwell.'
\v 21 Then you will say in your heart, 'Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering back and forth? Who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?'"
\p
\v 22 Thus says Adonai יהוה, "Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations, and set up My banner to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
\v 23 Kings shall be your faithful \add nurturing fathers\add*, and their queens your nursing mothers; they shall bow down to you with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am יהוה; and those who wait for Me shall not be disappointed."
\p
\v 24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of the [tyrant]\f + \fr 49:24 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading present in Syr., LXX, Lat. and DSS. Heb. MT reads, "righteous." Compare verse 25.\f* be delivered?
\p
\v 25 But thus says יהוה, "Even the captives of the tyrant shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children.
\v 26 I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I, יהוה, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Ya'aqov."
\c 50
\p
\v 1 Thus says יהוה, "Where is the bill of your mother's divorce, with which I have put her away? Or which of My creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities were you sold, and for your transgressions was your mother put away.
\v 2 Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is My hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.
\v 3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering."
\p
\v 4 Adonai יהוה has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary: He wakens morning by morning, He wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.
\v 5 Adonai יהוה has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.
\v 6 I gave my back to the strikers, and my cheeks to those who pulled \add off the beard\add*; I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.
\p
\v 7 For Adonai יהוה will help me; therefore I have not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be disappointed.
\v 8 He is near who declares me right; who will bring charges against me? Let us stand up together: who is the owner of my judgment? Let him come near to me.
\p
\v 9 Behold, Adonai יהוה will help me; who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, the moth shall eat them up.
\v 10 Who is among you who fears יהוה, who obeys the voice of His servant? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him rely on the Name of יהוה, and lean on his Elohim.
\p
\v 11 Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves; walk in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that you have kindled. You shall have this of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.
\c 51
\p
\v 1 "Listen to Me, you who follow after righteousness, you who seek יהוה: look to the Rock you were cut from, and to the hold of the pit you were dug from.
\v 2 Look to Avraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you; for when he was but one \add man\add* I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.
\p
\v 3 For יהוה has comforted Tsion; He has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of יהוה; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
\p
\v 4 "Attend to Me, My people; and give ear to Me, My nation: for Torah shall go forth from Me, and I will establish My judgment for a light of the peoples.
\v 5 My righteousness is near, My salvation is gone forth, and My arms shall judge the peoples; the islands shall wait for Me, and on My arm shall they trust.
\v 6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and those who dwell therein shall die in the same way: but My salvation shall be forever, and My righteousness shall not be abolished.
\p
\v 7 "Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is My Torah; do not fear the reproach of men, neither be dismayed at their insults.
\v 8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but My righteousness shall be forever, and My salvation to all generations."

\v 9 Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of יהוה; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not You who cut Rahav in pieces, who pierced the monster?\f + \fr 51:9 \fk Monster \ft See footnote at Yeshayahu 13:22.\f*
\v 10 Is it not You who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
\v 11 The ransomed of יהוה shall return, and come with singing to Tsion; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy; \add and\add* sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
\p
\v 12 "I, even I, am He who comforts you: who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die, and of the son of man who shall be made as grass;
\v 13 and have forgotten יהוה your Maker, who stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fear continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he makes ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?
\p
\v 14 The captive exile shall speedily be freed; and he shall not die \add and go down\add* into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.
\v 15 For I am יהוה your Elohim, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar: יהוה Tsevaot is His name.
\v 16 I have put My words in your mouth, and have covered you in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and tell Tsion, 'You are My people.'"
\p
\v 17 Awake, awake, stand up, Yerushalayim, you that have drunk at the hand of יהוה the cup ofHis wrath; you have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.
\v 18 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up.
\v 19 These two things have happened to you. Who will pity you? Desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort you?
\v 20 Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of יהוה, the rebuke of your Elohim.
\p
\v 21 Therefore hear now this, you afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:
\v 22 Thus says Adonai יהוה, and your Elohim who pleads the cause of His people, "Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of My wrath; you shall no more drink it again:
\v 23 and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, who have said to your being, 'Bow down, that we may walk over you;' and you have laid your back as the ground, and as the street, to those who walk over."
\c 52
\p
\v 1 Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Tsion; put on your beautiful garments, O Yerushalayim, the set-apart city: for henceforth there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.
\v 2 Shake yourself from the dust; arise, sit \add on your throne\add*, Yerushalayim: release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Tsion.
\p
\v 3 For thus says יהוה, "You were sold for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without money."
\v 4 For thus says Adonai יהוה, "My people went down at the first into Mitsrayim to live there: and the Ashuwrite has oppressed them without cause.
\v 5 Now therefore, what do I have here," says יהוה, "seeing that My people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them mock," says יהוה, "and My Name continually all the day is blasphemed.
\v 6 Therefore My people shall know My Name: therefore \add they shall know\add* in that day that I am He who does speak; behold, it is I."
\p
\v 7 How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Tsion, "Your Elohim reigns!"
\v 8 The voice of your watchmen! They lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when יהוה returns to Tsion.
\v 9 Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Yerushalayim; for יהוה has comforted His people, He has redeemed Yerushalayim.
\v 10 יהוה has made bare His set-apart arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our Elohim.
\p
\v 11 Depart, depart, go out from there, touch no unclean thing! Go out of the midst of her! Cleanse yourselves, you who bear the vessels of יהוה.
\v 12 For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight: for יהוה will go before you; and the Elohim of Yisra'el will be your rear guard.
\v 13 Behold, My Servant shall deal wisely, He shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.
\v 14 Like as many were astonished at you (His appearance was marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men),
\v 15 so shall He sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.
\c 53
\p
\v 1 Who has believed our message? To whom has the Arm of יהוה been revealed?
\v 2 For He grew up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. He has no form nor comeliness. When we see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him.
\p
\v 3 He was despised, and rejected by men; a man of suffering, and acquainted with disease. He was despised as one from whom men hide their face; and we respected Him not.
\p
\v 4 Surely He has borne our sickness, and carried our suffering; yet we considered Him plagued, struck by Elohim, and afflicted.
\v 5 But He was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. The correction that brought our peace was on Him; and by His wounds we are healed.
\p
\v 6 All we like sheep have gone astray. Everyone has turned to his own way; and יהוה has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.
\p
\v 7 He was oppressed, yet when He was afflicted He did not open His mouth. As a lamb that is led to slaying, and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute, so He did not open His mouth.
\p
\v 8 He was taken away by oppression and judgment; and as for His generation, who considered that He was cut off out of the land of the living and stricken for the disobedience of My people?
\v 9 They made His grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in His death; although He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in His mouth.
\v 10 Yet it pleased יהוה to bruise Him. He has caused Him to suffer. He laid sickness on Him, that when He made Himself an offering for guilt, He would see a seed, He would prolong His days, and the pleasure of יהוה prosper in His hand.
\p
\v 11 After the toil of His being, He will see the light\f + \fr 53:11 \ft LXX and DSS read as it is here. Heb. MT and Lat., however, omit the words "the light." Syr. reads, "the reward" instead of "the light."\f* and be satisfied. My Righteous Servant will declare many right by the knowledge of Himself; and He will bear their iniquities.
\p
\v 12 Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong; because He poured out His being to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
\c 54
\p
\v 1 "Sing, barren, you who did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife," says יהוה.
\v 2 "Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations; do not spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.
\v 3 For you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left; and your seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
\p
\v 4 "Do not be afraid; for you shall not be ashamed: neither be confounded; for you shall not be disappointed: for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach of your widowhood you shall remember no more.
\v 5 For your Maker is your owner; יהוה Tsevaot is His Name: and the Set-apart One of Yisra'el is your Redeemer; the Elohim of the whole earth shall he be called.
\v 6 For יהוה has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off," says your Elohim.
\p
\v 7 "For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great compassion I will gather you.
\v 8 In overflowing wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; but with everlasting loving-kindness will I have compassion on you," says יהוה your Redeemer.
\p
\v 9 "For this is like the waters of Noaḥ to Me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noaḥ shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.
\v 10 For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but My loving-kindness shall not depart from you, neither shall My covenant of peace be removed," says יהוה who has compassion on you.
\p
\v 11 "You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires.
\v 12 I will make your pinnacles of rubies, and your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.
\v 13 All your children shall be taught of יהוה; and great shall be the peace of your children.
\v 14 In righteousness you shall be established: you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not be afraid; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.
\v 15 Behold, they may gather together, but not by Me: whoever shall gather together against you shall fall because of you.
\p
\v 16 "Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the destroyer to destroy.
\v 17 No weapon that is formed against you will prevail; and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of יהוה, and their righteousness which is of Me," says יהוה.
\c 55
\p
\v 1 "Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters! Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat! Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
\v 2 Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? And your labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen diligently to Me, and eat you that which is good, and let your being delight itself in fatness.
\v 3 Turn your ear, and come to Me; hear, and your being shall live: and I will cut an everlasting covenant with you, even the faithful loving-kindnesses of David.
\p
\v 4 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.
\p
\v 5 Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know; and a nation that did not know you shall run to you, because of יהוה your Elohim, and for the Set-apart One of Yisra'el; for He has glorified you."
\p
\v 6 Seek יהוה while He may be found; call you on Him while He is near:
\v 7 let the wicked forsake his way, and the man \add doing\add* vain exertion his thoughts; and let him return to יהוה, and He will have compassion on him; and to our Elohim, for He will abundantly pardon.
\p
\v 8 "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways," says יהוה.
\v 9 "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.
\v 10 For as the rain comes down and the snow from the heavens, and does not return there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
\v 11 so shall My word be that goes forth out of My mouth: it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing I sent it to do.
\p
\v 12 For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands.
\v 13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to יהוה for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off."
\c 56
\p
\v 1 Thus says יהוה, "Guard judgment, and do righteousness; for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.
\v 2 Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast; who guards the Sabbath from profaning it, and guards his hand from doing any evil."
\p
\v 3 Neither let the son of the foreigner, who has joined himself to יהוה, speak, saying, "יהוה will surely separate me from His people;" neither let the eunuch say, "Behold, I am a dry tree."
\p
\v 4 For thus says יהוה, "To the eunuchs who guard My Sabbaths, and choose the things that please Me, and hold fast My covenant:
\v 5 to them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
\v 6 Also the foreigners who join themselves to יהוה, to minister to Him, and to love the Name of יהוה, to be His servants, everyone who guards the Sabbath from profaning it, and holds fast My covenant;
\v 7 even them will I bring to My set-apart mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer: their ascension offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar; for My House shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples."
\p
\v 8 Adonai יהוה, who gathers the outcasts of Yisra'el, says, "Yet will I gather \add others\add* to him, besides his own who are gathered."
\p
\v 9 All you animals of the field, come to devour, \add yes,\add* all you animals in the forest.
\v 10 His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
\v 11 Yes, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds who cannot understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.
\p
\v 12 "Come," \add say they,\add* "I will get wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as today, \add a day\add* great beyond measure."
\c 57
\p
\v 1 The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and kind men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil \add to come\add*.
\v 2 He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.
\p
\v 3 "But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.
\v 4 Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against whom do you make a wide mouth,\f + \fr 57:4 \fk Wide mouth \ft Idiom meaning "sneer."\f* and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,
\v 5 you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the children in the wadis, under the clefts of the rocks?
\p
\v 6 Among the smooth \add stones\add* of the wadi is your portion; they, they are your lot; you have even poured a drink offering to them. You have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?
\v 7 On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed; there also you went up to slaughter a sacrifice.
\v 8 Behind the doors and the posts you have set up your memorial: far from Me, you have uncovered \add yourself\add*, and have gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and cut you \add a covenant\add* with them: you loved their bed where you saw it.
\v 9 You went to the king with oil, and did increase your perfumes, and did send your ambassadors far off, and debased yourself even to Sheol.
\v 10 You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you did not say, 'It is in vain.' You found a reviving of your strength; therefore you were not faint.
\p
\v 11 "Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie, and have not remembered Me, nor laid it to your heart? Have I not held My peace even of long time, and you do not fear Me?
\v 12 I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they shall not profit you.
\v 13 When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My set-apart mountain."
\p
\v 14 He will say, "Cast up, cast up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of My people."
\p
\v 15 For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose Name is Set-apart: "I dwell in the high and set-apart place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
\v 16 For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would faint before Me, and the breath which I have made.
\v 17 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid \add My face\add* and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
\v 18 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
\v 19 I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near," says יהוה; "and I will heal them."
\p
\v 20 But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
\p
\v 21 "There is no peace," says my Elohim, "for the wicked."
\c 58
\p
\v 1 "Cry aloud, do not spare, lift up your voice like a shofar, and declare to My people their disobedience, and to the house of Ya'aqov their sins.
\v 2 Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and did not forsake the judgments of their Elohim, they ask of Me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to Elohim.
\p
\v 3 'Why have we fasted,' \add say they,\add* 'and you do not see? \add Why\add* have we afflicted our being, and You take no knowledge?' "Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and exact all your labors.
\v 4 Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness: you do not fast today so as to make your voice to be heard on high.
\v 5 Is such the fast that I have chosen? The day for a man to afflict his being? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to יהוה?
\p
\v 6 "Is this not the fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?
\v 7 Is it not to distribute your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?
\p
\v 8 Then your light shall break forth as the morning, and your healing shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of יהוה shall be your rear guard.
\v 9 Then you shall call, and יהוה will answer; you shall cry, and He will say, 'Here I am.' "If you take away from the yoke from your midst, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vain exertion;
\v 10 and if you draw out your being to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted being: then your light shall rise in darkness, and your obscurity be as the noonday;
\v 11 and יהוה will guide you continually, and satisfy your being in dry places, and make strong your bones; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
\p
\v 12 Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called 'The repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in.'
\p
\v 13 "If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on My set-apart day; and call the Sabbath a delight, \add and\add* the set-apart of יהוה honorable; and shall honor it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking \add your own\add* words:
\v 14 then you shall delight yourself in יהוה; and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Ya'aqov your father:" for the mouth of יהוה has spoken it.
\c 59
\p
\v 1 Behold, the hand of יהוה is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear:
\v 2 but your iniquities have separated between you and your Elohim, and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear.
\v 3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters unrighteousness.
\v 4 None sues in righteousness, and none judges faithfully: they rely on emptiness, and speak lies; they conceive toil, and bring forth vain exertion.
\p
\v 5 They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.
\v 6 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of vain exertion, and the act of violence is in their hands.
\v 7 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of vain exertion; desolation and destruction are in their paths.
\v 8 The way of peace they do not know; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whoever goes therein does not know peace.
\p
\v 9 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither does righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.
\v 10 We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those who have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among those who are lusty we are as dead men.
\v 11 We roar all like bears, and moan bitterly like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
\p
\v 12 For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:
\v 13 transgressing and denying יהוה, and turning away from following our Elohim, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
\p
\v 14 Judgment is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.
\v 15 Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself a spoil. יהוה saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no judgment.
\v 16 He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore His own Arm brought salvation to Him; and His righteousness, it supported Him.
\p
\v 17 He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head; and He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.
\v 18 According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay, wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; to the islands He will repay recompense.
\v 19 So shall they fear the Name of יהוה from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun; for He will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of יהוה drives.
\p
\v 20 "A Redeemer will come to Tsion, and to those who turn from disobedience in Ya'aqov," says יהוה.
\p
\v 21 "As for Me, this is My covenant with them," says יהוה. "My Ruaḥ who is on you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed," says יהוה, "from henceforth and forever."
\c 60
\p
\v 1 "Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of יהוה is risen on you.
\v 2 For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but יהוה will arise on you, and His glory shall be seen on you.
\v 3 Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.
\p
\v 4 "Lift up your eyes all around, and see: they all gather themselves together, they come to you; your sons shall come from far, and your daughters shall be faithfully \add carried\add* in the arms.
\v 5 Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.

\v 6 The multitude of camels shall cover you, the camels of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheva shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praises of יהוה.
\v 7 All the flocks of Qedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nevaioth shall minister to you; they shall come up with acceptance on My altar; and I will glorify the house of My glory.
\p
\v 8 "Who are these who fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
\v 9 Surely the islands shall wait for Me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the Name of יהוה your Elohim, and for the Set-apart One of Yisra'el, because He has glorified you.
\p
\v 10 "Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you: for in My wrath I struck you, but in My \add good\add* will have I had compassion on you.
\v 11 Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.
\v 12 For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
\p
\v 13 "The glory of Levanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My set-apart place; and I will make the place of My feet glorious.
\v 14 The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending to you; and all those who despised you shall bow themselves down at the soles of your feet; and they shall call you 'The city of יהוה, the Tsion of the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.'
\p
\v 15 "Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through you, I will make you an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.
\v 16 You shall also drink the milk of the nations,\f + \fr 60:16 \fk Milk of the nations \ft Idiom meaning "wealth of the nations."\f* and shall nurse from royal breasts; and you shall know that I, יהוה, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Ya'aqov.
\v 17 For copper I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood copper, and for stones iron. I will also make your officers peace, and righteousness your ruler.
\v 18 Violence shall no more be heard in your land, desolation nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls 'Salvation' and your gates 'Praise.'
\p
\v 19 The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you: but יהוה will be to you an everlasting light, and your Elohim your glory.
\v 20 Your sun shall no more go down, neither shall your moon withdraw itself; for יהוה will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended.
\v 21 Your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, that I may be glorified.
\v 22 The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation; I, יהוה, will hasten it in its time."
\c 61
\p
\v 1 The Ruaḥ of Adonai יהוה is on me; because יהוה has anointed me to bring good news to the humble. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, release to those who are bound, [and recovery of sight to the blind];\f + \fr 61:1 \ft Bracketed section indicates reading present in the DSS and the LXX but absent from the Heb. MT, Syr., and Lat.. See also Loukas 4:18.\f*
\v 2 to proclaim the year of \add the\add* acceptance of יהוה, and the day of vengeance of our Elohim; to comfort all who mourn;
\v 3 to appoint to those who mourn in Tsion, to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of יהוה, that He may be glorified.
\p
\v 4 They shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
\v 5 Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
\v 6 But you shall be named the priests of יהוה; men will call you the ministers of our Elohim: you will eat the wealth of the nations, and you will boast in their glory.
\v 7 Instead of your shame \add you shall have\add* double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be to them.

\v 8 "For I, יהוה, love judgment, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will cut an everlasting covenant with them.
\v 9 Their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which יהוה has blessed."
\p
\v 10 I will greatly rejoice in יהוה, my being shall be joyful in my Elohim; for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
\v 11 For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so Adonai יהוה will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

\v 1 For Tsion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Yerushalayim's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burns.
\v 2 The nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of יהוה shall name.
\v 3 You shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of יהוה, and a royal diadem in the hand of your Elohim.
\v 4 It will no more be said of you, 'Forsaken;' neither shall it be said of your land any more, 'Desolate;' but you shall be called 'Ḥephtsivah,'\f + \fr 62:4 \fk חפצי בה \ft (Ḥeph'tsi'vah) – From the Hebrew words חפץ (Ḥeph'ets) meaning "delight" and בה (vah) meaning "her:" "My delight is in her."\f* and your land 'Beulah;'\f + \fr 62:4 \fk בעולה \ft (Beulah) – From the feminine form of בעל (ba'al) meaning "Married."\f* for יהוה delights in you, and your land shall be married.
\v 5 For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons shall marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your Elohim will rejoice over you.
\v 6 I have set watchmen on your walls, Yerushalayim; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: you who call on יהוה, take no rest,
\v 7 and give him no rest, until He establishes, and until He makes Yerushalayim a praise in the earth.
\v 8 יהוה has sworn by His right hand, and by the Arm of His strength, "Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine, for which you have labored:
\v 9 but those who have garnered it shall eat it, and praise יהוה; and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of My set-apart place."
\p
\v 10 Go through, go through the gates! Prepare the way of the people! Cast up, cast up the highway! Gather out the stones! Lift up a banner for the peoples.
\v 11 Behold, יהוה has proclaimed to the end of the earth, "Say to the daughter of Tsion, 'Behold, your salvation comes. Behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.'"
\v 12 They shall call them 'The set-apart people, the redeemed of יהוה:' and you shall be called 'Sought out, a city not forsaken.'
\c 63

\v 1 Who is this who comes from Edom, with dazzling garments from Botsrah? This who is glorious in His clothing, marching in the greatness of His strength? "It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save."
\p
\v 2 Why are You red in Your clothing, and Your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?
\p
\v 3 "I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yes, I trod them in My anger, and trampled them in My wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, and I have stained all My clothing.
\v 4 For the day of vengeance was in My heart, and the year of My redeemed is come.
\v 5 I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to support: therefore My own arm brought salvation to Me; and My wrath supported Me.
\v 6 I trod down the peoples in My anger, and made them drunk in My wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth."
\p
\v 7 I will make mention of the loving-kindnesses of יהוה, \add and\add* the praises of יהוה, according to all that יהוה has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Yisra'el, which He has bestowed on them according to His compassion, and according to the multitude of His loving-kindnesses.
\v 8 For He said, "Surely, they are My people, children who will not deal falsely:" so He became like their Savior.
\v 9 In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the messenger of His presence saved them: in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
\v 10 But they rebelled, and grieved His Set-apart Ruaḥ: therefore He was turned to be their enemy, \add and\add* Himself fought against them.
\p
\v 11 Then He remembered the days of old, Mosheh \add and\add* His people, \add saying,\add* 'Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is He who put His Set-apart Ruaḥ in the midst of them?'
\v 12 Who caused His glorious Arm to go at the right hand of Mosheh? Who divided the waters before them, to make Himself an everlasting Name?
\v 13 Who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble?
\p
\v 14 As the livestock that go down into the valley, the Ruaḥ of יהוה caused them to rest; so You led Your people, to make Yourself a glorious Name.
\v 15 Look down from heavens, and see from the habitation of Your set-apartness and of Your glory: where are Your zeal and Your mighty acts? The yearning of Your gut and Your compassion is restrained toward me.
\v 16 For You are our Father, though Avraham does not know us, and Yisra'el does not acknowledge us: you, יהוה, are our Father; our Redeemer, \add and\add* Your Name is from everlasting.
\v 17 O יהוה, why do You make us to err from Your ways, and harden our heart from Your fear? Return for Your servants' sake, the tribes of Your inheritance.
\v 18 Your set-apart people possessed \add it\add* but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down Your set-apart place.
\v 19 We have become as they over whom You never bear rule, as those who were not called by Your Name.
\c 64
\p
\v 1 Oh that You would tear the heavens, that You would come down, that the mountains might quake at Your presence,
\v 2 as when fire kindles the brushwood, the fire causes the waters to boil; to make Your Name known to Your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!
\v 3 When You did awesome things which we did not look for, You came down, the mountains quaked at Your presence.
\v 4 For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen an Elohim besides You, who works for him who waits for him.
\v 5 You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, and we sinned. We have been in sin for a long time; and shall we be saved?
\v 6 For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is as a polluted garment: and we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
\v 7 There is none who calls on Your Name, who stirs up himself to take hold of You; for You have hidden Your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
\v 8 But now, יהוה, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.
\v 9 Do not be furious, יהוה, neither remember iniquity forever: see, look, we beg You, we are all Your people.
\v 10 Your set-apart cities are become a wilderness, Tsion is become a wilderness, Yerushalayim a desolation.
\v 11 Our set-apart and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised You, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
\v 12 Will You refrain Yourself for these things, יהוה? Will You hold Your peace, and afflict us very severely?

\v 1 "I am inquired of by those who did not ask; I am found by those who did not seek Me: I said, See Me, see Me, to a nation that was not called by My Name.
\v 2 I have spread out My hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;
\v 3 a people who provoke Me to My face continually, slaughtering in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;\f + \fr 65:3 \ft There are two prohibited practices mentioned here. The first is offering slaughterings in gardens and the second is burning incense on bricks. Slaughterings could only be made at the place where יהוה chose to place His Name (Devarim 12:13-14) and that place was Yerushalayim (Melakhim א 8:29). Whenever an altar was to be made, it was only to be made from uncut stone, and nothing a tool had touched. Because of this, brick was therefore not allowed (Shemoth 20:25).\f*
\v 4 who sit among the graves, and lodge in the preserved places; who eat pig's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
\v 5 who say, 'Stand by yourself, do not come near to me, for I am more set apart than you.' These are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burns all the day.
\v 6 Behold, it is written before Me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,
\v 7 your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together," says יהוה, "who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed Me on the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom."
\v 8 Thus says יהוה, "As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, 'Do not destroy it, for a blessing is in it:' so will I do for My servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.
\v 9 I will bring forth a seed out of Ya'aqov, and out of Yehudah an inheritor of My mountains; and My chosen shall inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there.
\v 10 Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Akor a place for herds to lie down in, for My people who have sought Me.
\v 11 But you who forsake יהוה, who forget My set-apart mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;\f + \fr 65:11 \ft "Fortune" and "Destiny" are גד (Gad) and מני (Meni) in Hebrew. These are believed to be two foreign elohim that the Yisra'elites had begun to worship.\f*
\v 12 I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaying; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear; but you did that which was evil in My eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight."
\v 13 Therefore thus says Adonai יהוה, "Behold, My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, My servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, My servants shall rejoice, but you shall be disappointed;
\v 14 behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.
\v 15 You shall leave your name for a curse to My chosen; and Adonai יהוה will kill you; and He will call His servants by another name:
\v 16 so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the Elohim of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the Elohim of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.
\v 17 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into heart.
\v 18 But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Yerushalayim a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
\v 19 I will rejoice in Yerushalayim, and joy in My people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.
\v 20 "There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed.
\v 21 They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
\v 22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of My people, and My chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
\v 23 They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of יהוה, and their offspring with them.
\v 24 It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
\v 25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the naḥash's food.\f + \fr 65:25 \ft See Bereshiyt 3:14.\f* They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My set-apart mountain," says יהוה.
\c 66
\p
\v 1 Thus says יהוה, "The heavens are My throne, and the earth is My footstool: what kind of house will you build to Me? And what place shall be My rest?
\v 2 For all these things has My hand made, and \add so\add* all these things came to be," says יהוה: "but to this man will I look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word.
\v 3 He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who slaughters a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an offering, \add is as he who offers\add* pig's blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses vain exertion. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their being delights in their abominations:
\v 4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in My eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight."
\v 5 Hear the word of יהוה, you who tremble at His word: "Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for My Name's sake, have said, 'Let יהוה be glorified, that we may see your joy;' but it is those who shall be disappointed.
\v 6 A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the Temple, a voice of יהוה that renders recompense to His enemies.
\v 7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she delivered a son.
\v 8 Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Tsion travailed, she brought forth her children.
\v 9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?" says יהוה: "shall I who cause to bring forth shut \add the womb\add*?" says your Elohim.
\v 10 Rejoice with Yerushalayim, and be glad for her, all you who love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;
\v 11 that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts; that you may drink deeply, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory."
\p
\v 12 For thus says יהוה, "Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing wadi: and you will nurse. You will be carried on her side, and will be bounced on her knees.
\v 13 As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted in Yerushalayim."
\v 14 You will see \add it\add*, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of יהוה shall be known toward His servants; and He will have indignation against His enemies.
\v 15 For, behold, יהוה will come with fire, and His chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render His anger with fierceness, and His rebuke with flames of fire.
\v 16 For by fire will יהוה execute judgment, and by His sword, on all flesh; and the slain of יהוה shall be many.
\v 17 Those who set themselves apart and purify themselves in the gardens, behind \add the\add* one \add idol\add* in the midst, eating pig's flesh, detestable \add things\add*, and the mouse, they be shall consumed together," says יהוה.
\v 18 For I \add know\add* their works and their thoughts: \add the time\add* comes, that I will gather all nations and languages; and they shall come, and shall see My glory.
\v 19 I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tuval and Yavan, to the islands afar off, who have not heard My fame, neither have seen My glory; and they shall declare My glory among the nations.
\p
\v 20 "They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to יהוה, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on camels, to My set-apart mountain Yerushalayim," says יהוה, "as the children of Yisra'el bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of יהוה.
\v 21 Of them also will I take for priests \add and\add* for Levites," says יהוה.
\v 22 "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me," says יהוה, "so your seed and your name shall remain.
\v 23 And it shall be, that from new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to bow down before Me," says יהוה.
\v 24 "They shall go forth, and look on the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against Me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they will be loathsome to all mankind."
