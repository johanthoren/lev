\p
\v 1 These are the words which Mosheh spoke to all Yisra'el beyond the Yarden in the wilderness, in the Aravah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Lavan, and Ḥatseroth, and Dizahav.
\v 2 It is eleven days' \add journey\add* from Ḥorev by the way of Mount Seir to Qadesh Barnea.
\v 3 It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh new moon, on the first day of the new moon, that Mosheh spoke to the children of Yisra'el, according to all that יהוה had given him in command to them;
\v 4 after He had struck Siḥon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Ḥeshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
\v 5 Beyond the Yarden, in the land of Moav, Mosheh began to declare this, the Torah, saying,
\p
\v 6 "יהוה our Elohim spoke to us in Ḥorev, saying, 'You have lived long enough in this mountain:
\v 7 turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all \add the places\add* near there, in the Aravah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the seashore, the land of the Kena'anites, and Levanon, as far as the great river, the Perath River.\f + \fr 1:7 \fk Perath \ft The Euphrates River, and probably the etymological origin of the name.\f*
\v 8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which יהוה swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya'aqov, to give to them and to their seed after them.'"
\p
\v 9 "I spoke to you at that time, saying, 'I am not able to bear you myself alone:
\v 10 יהוה your Elohim has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the heavens for multitude.
\v 11 יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as He has promised you!
\v 12 How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
\v 13 Take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.'
\v 14 You answered me, and said, 'The thing which you have spoken is good to do.'
\v 15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
\p
\v 16 I commanded your judges at that time, saying, "Hear \add the cases\add* between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner who dwells with him.
\v 17 You shall not respect persons in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment \add belongs to\add* Elohim: and the cause that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it."
\v 18 I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
\p
\v 19 We traveled from Ḥorev, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as יהוה our Elohim commanded us; and we came to Qadesh Barnea.
\v 20 I said to you, "You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which יהוה our Elohim gives to us.
\v 21 Behold, יהוה your Elohim has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, has spoken to you; do not be afraid, neither be dismayed."
\p
\v 22 You came near to me everyone of you, and said, "Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come."
\v 23 The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:
\v 24 and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the wadi Eshkol, and spied it out.
\v 25 They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, "It is a good land which יהוה our Elohim gives to us."
\p
\v 26 Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of יהוה your Elohim:
\v 27 and you grumbled in your tents, and said, "Because יהוה hated us, He has brought us forth out of the land of Mitsrayim, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\v 28 Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, 'The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the heavens; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anaqim there.'"
\v 29 Then I said to you, "Do not dread, neither be afraid of them.
\v 30 יהוה your Elohim who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Mitsrayim before your eyes,
\v 31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that יהוה your Elohim bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place."
\v 32 Yet in this thing you did not trust in יהוה your Elohim,
\v 33 who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.
\p
\v 34 יהוה heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,
\v 35 "Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
\v 36 except Kalev the son of Yephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed יהוה."
\v 37 Also יהוה was angry with me for your sakes, saying, "You also shall not go in there:
\v 38 Yehoshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there: you, strengthen him; for he shall cause Yisra'el to inherit it.
\v 39 Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be \add for\add* plunder, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
\v 40 But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Reeds."
\p
\v 41 Then you answered and said to me, "We have sinned against יהוה, we will go up and fight, according to all that יהוה our Elohim commanded us." Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.
\v 42 יהוה said to me, "Tell them, 'Do not go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.'"
\v 43 So I spoke to you, and you did not listen; but you rebelled against the command of יהוה, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.
\v 44 The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Ḥormah.
\v 45 You returned and wept before יהוה; but יהוה did not listen to your voice, nor gave ear to you.
\v 46 So you stayed in Qadesh many days, according to the days that you stayed \add there\add*.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Reeds, as יהוה spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days.
\v 2 יהוה spoke to me, saying,
\v 3 "You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward.
\v 4 Command the people, saying, 'You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esaw, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: guard yourselves therefore;
\v 5 do not contend with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esaw for a possession.
\v 6 You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.'"
\v 7 For יהוה your Elohim has blessed you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years יהוה your Elohim has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
\p
\v 8 So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esaw, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Aravah from Elath and from Etsion Gever. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moav.
\v 9 יהוה said to me, "Do not bother Moav, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession."
\v 10 (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anaqim:
\v 11 these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anaqim; but the Moavites call them Emim.
\v 12 The Ḥorites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esaw dispossessed them; and they destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Yisra'el did to the land of his possession, which יהוה gave to them.)
\v 13 "Now rise up, and cross over the wadi Zered." We went over the wadi Zered.
\v 14 The days in which we came from Qadesh Barnea, until we were come over the wadi Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as יהוה swore to them.
\v 15 Moreover the hand of יהוה was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
\p
\v 16 So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
\v 17 that יהוה spoke to me, saying,
\v 18 "Today you are to pass over Ar, the border of Moav:
\v 19 and when you come near over against the children of Ammon, do not bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession."
\p
\v 20 (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived therein before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
\v 21 a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anaqim; but יהוה destroyed them before them; and they dispossessed them, and lived in their place;
\v 22 as He did for the children of Esaw, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Ḥorites from before them; and they dispossessed them, and lived in their place even to this day:
\v 23 and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Kaphtorim, who came forth out of Kaphtor,\f + \fr 2:23 \ft That is, Crete.\f* destroyed them, and lived in their place.)
\p
\v 24 "Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the wadi of Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Siḥon the Amorite, king of Ḥeshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
\v 25 This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heavens, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you."
\p
\v 26 I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Qedemoth to Siḥon king of Ḥeshbon with words of peace, saying,
\v 27 "Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.
\v 28 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,
\v 29 as the children of Esaw who dwell in Seir, and the Moavites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass over the Yarden into the land which יהוה our Elohim gives us."
\v 30 But Siḥon king of Ḥeshbon would not let us pass by him; for יהוה your Elohim hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your hand, as at this day.
\v 31 יהוה said to me, "Behold, I have begun to deliver up Siḥon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land."
\p
\v 32 Then Siḥon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Yahats.
\v 33 יהוה our Elohim delivered him up before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people.
\v 34 We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:
\v 35 only the livestock we plundered to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
\v 36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and \add from\add* the city that is in the wadi, even to Gilad, there was not a city too high for us; יהוה our Elohim delivered up all before us.
\v 37 Only to the land of the children of Ammon you did not come near; all the side of the wadi Yabboq, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever יהוה our Elohim forbade us.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
\v 2 יהוה said to me, "Do not fear him; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Siḥon king of the Amorites, who lived at Ḥeshbon."
\v 3 So יהוה our Elohim delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining.
\v 4 We took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argov, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\v 5 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns, a great many.
\v 6 We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Siḥon king of Ḥeshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.
\v 7 But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we plundered to ourselves.
\p
\v 8 We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Yarden, from the wadi of Arnon to Mount Ḥermon;
\v 9 (\add which\add* Ḥermon the Tsidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;)
\v 10 all the cities of the plain, and all Gilad, and all Bashan, to Salekah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\v 11 (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man).
\p
\v 12 This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the wadi of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilad, and its cities, gave I to the Reuvenites and to the Gadites:
\v 13 and the rest of Gilad, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Menasheh; all the region of Argov, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.
\v 14 Yair the son of Menasheh took all the region of Argov, to the border of the Geshurites and the Ma'akathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Ḥavvoth Yair, to this day.)
\v 15 I gave Gilad to Makir.
\v 16 To the Reuvenites, and to the Gadites I gave from Gilad even to the wadi of Arnon, the middle of the wadi, and the border \add of it\add*, even to the wadi Yabboq, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
\v 17 the Aravah also, and the Yarden and the border \add of it\add*, from Kinnereth even to the sea of the Aravah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
\p
\v 18 I commanded you at that time, saying, "יהוה your Elohim has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Yisra'el, all the men of valor.
\v 19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,
\v 20 until יהוה gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which יהוה your Elohim gives them beyond the Yarden: then you shall return every man to his possession, which I have given you."
\v 21 I commanded Yehoshua at that time, saying, "Your eyes have seen all that יהוה your Elohim has done to these two kings: so shall יהוה do to all the kingdoms where you go over.
\v 22 You shall not fear them; for יהוה your Elohim, it is He who fights for you."
\p
\ms פרשת ואתחנן – Parashat Va'etḥanan
\v 23 I begged יהוה at that time, saying,
\v 24 "Adonai יהוה, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness, and Your strong Hand: for what el is there in \add the\add* heavens or in earth, that can do according to Your works, and according to Your mighty acts?
\v 25 Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Yarden, that goodly mountain, and Levanon."
\v 26 But יהוה was angry with me for your sakes, and did not listen to me; and יהוה said to me, "Let it suffice you; speak no more to Me of this matter.
\v 27 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Yarden.
\v 28 But commission Yehoshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see."
\v 29 So we stayed in the valley over against Beth Peor.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Now, Yisra'el, listen to the statutes and the judgments, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, gives you.
\v 2 You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you remove from it, that you may guard the commands of יהוה your Elohim which I command you.
\v 3 Your eyes have seen what יהוה did because of Ba'al Peor; for all the men who followed Ba'al Peor, יהוה your Elohim has destroyed them from your midst.
\v 4 But you who did cling to יהוה your Elohim are all alive today.
\p
\v 5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as יהוה my Elohim commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it.
\v 6 Guard therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."
\v 7 For what great nation is there, that has an elohim so near to them, as יהוה our Elohim is whenever we call on \add Him\add*?
\v 8 What great nation is there, that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this Torah, which I set before you today?
\p
\v 9 Only guard yourself, and guard your being diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children's children;
\v 10 the day that you stood before יהוה your Elohim in Ḥorev, when יהוה said to me, "Assemble \add for\add* Me the people, and I will make them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children."
\v 11 You came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the heavens, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.
\v 12 יהוה spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; only \add you heard\add* a voice.
\v 13 He declared to you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even the Ten Words; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.
\v 14 יהוה commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.
\p
\v 15 Guard yourselves therefore; for you saw no kind of form on the day that יהוה spoke to you in Ḥorev out of the midst of the fire.
\v 16 Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
\v 17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the heavens,
\v 18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;
\v 19 and lest you lift up your eyes to the heavens, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the heavens, you are drawn away and bow down to them, and serve them, which יהוה your Elohim has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heavens.
\v 20 But יהוה has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Mitsrayim, to be to Him a people of inheritance, as at this day.
\p
\v 21 Furthermore יהוה was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Yarden, and that I should not go in to that good land, which יהוה your Elohim gives you for an inheritance:
\v 22 but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Yarden; but you shall go over, and possess that good land.
\v 23 Guard yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of יהוה your Elohim, which He cut with you, and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which יהוה your Elohim has forbidden you.
\v 24 For יהוה your Elohim is a devouring fire, a jealous El.
\p
\v 25 When you shall father children, and children's children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of יהוה your Elohim, to provoke Him to anger;
\v 26 I call the heavens and the earth to witness against you today, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Yarden to possess; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
\v 27 יהוה will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where יהוה shall lead you away.
\v 28 There you shall serve elohim, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
\v 29 But from there you shall seek יהוה your Elohim, and you shall find Him, when you search after Him with all your heart and with all your being.
\v 30 When you are in oppression, and all these things are come on you, in the latter days you shall return to יהוה your Elohim, and listen to His voice:
\v 31 for יהוה your Elohim is a compassionate El; He will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.
\p
\v 32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that Elohim created man on the earth, and from the one end of the heavens to the other, whether there has been \add any such thing\add* as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?
\v 33 Did ever a people hear the voice of Elohim speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
\v 34 Or has Elohim tried to go and take Him a nation from the midst of \add another\add* nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a Mighty Hand, and by an outstretched Arm, and by great terrors, according to all that יהוה your Elohim did for you in Mitsrayim before your eyes?
\v 35 It was shown to you so that you might know that יהוה is Elohim. There is no one else besides Him.
\v 36 Out of the heavens He made you to hear His voice, that He might discipline you: and on earth He made you to see His great fire; and you heard His words out of the midst of the fire.
\v 37 Because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their seed after them, and brought you out with His presence, with His great power, out of Mitsrayim;
\v 38 to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day.
\v 39 Know therefore today, and lay it to your heart, that יהוה, He is Elohim in heavens above and on the earth beneath; there is none else.
\v 40 You shall guard His statutes, and His commands, which I command you today, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which יהוה your Elohim gives you, forever.
\p
\v 41 Then Mosheh set apart three cities beyond the Yarden toward the sunrise;
\v 42 that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and did not hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
\v 43 \add namely,\add* Betser in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reuvenites; and Ramoth in Gilad, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Menashites.
\p
\v 44 This is the Torah which Mosheh set before the children of Yisra'el:
\v 45 these are the witnesses, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Mosheh spoke to the children of Yisra'el, when they came forth out of Mitsrayim,
\v 46 beyond the Yarden, in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Siḥon king of the Amorites, who lived at Ḥeshbon, whom Mosheh and the children of Yisra'el struck, when they came forth out of Mitsrayim.
\v 47 They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Yarden toward the sunrise;
\v 48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, even to Mount Sion (the same is Ḥermon),
\v 49 and all the Aravah beyond the Yarden eastward, even to the sea of the Aravah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Mosheh called to all Yisra'el, and said to them, "Hear, Yisra'el, the statutes and the judgments which I speak in your ears today, that you may learn them, and guard to do them.
\v 2 יהוה our Elohim cut a covenant with us in Ḥorev.
\v 3 יהוה did not cut this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive today.
\v 4 יהוה spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,
\v 5 (I stood between יהוה and you at that time, to show you the word of יהוה: for you were afraid because of the fire, and did not go up onto the mountain;) saying,
\p
\v 6 "I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the house of bondage.
\p
\v 7 "You shall have no other elohim before Me.
\p
\v 8 "You shall not make an engraved image for yourself, nor any likeness of anything that is in heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
\v 9 you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them; for I, יהוה, your Elohim, am a jealous El, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate Me;
\v 10 and showing loving-kindness to thousands of those who love Me and guard My commands.
\p
\v 11 "You shall not bring the Name of יהוה your Elohim to naught: for יהוה will not hold him guiltless who brings His Name to naught.
\p
\v 12 "Guard the Sabbath day, to keep it set-apart, as יהוה your Elohim commanded you.
\v 13 You shall serve six days, and do all your work;
\v 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to יהוה your Elohim, in which you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your sojourner who is within your gates; that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
\v 15 You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Mitsrayim, and יהוה your Elohim brought you out of there by a Mighty Hand and by an outstretched Arm: therefore יהוה your Elohim commanded you to keep the Sabbath day, [to set it apart].
\v 16 "Honor your father and your mother, as יהוה your Elohim commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you.
\v 17 "You shall not murder.
\v 18 "You shall not commit adultery.
\v 19 "You shall not steal.
\v 20 "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
\v 21 "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; neither shall you desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's."
\p
\v 22 These words יהוה spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and He added no more. He wrote them on two tablets of stone, and gave them to me.
\v 23 It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
\v 24 and you said, "Behold, יהוה our Elohim has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen today that Elohim does speak with man, and He lives.
\v 25 Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of יהוה our Elohim any more, then we shall die.
\v 26 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living Elohim speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
\v 27 Go near, and hear all that יהוה our Elohim shall say: and tell us all that יהוה our Elohim shall tell you; and we will hear it, and do it."
\p
\v 28 יהוה heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and יהוה said to me, "I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken.
\v 29 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear Me, and guard all My commands always, that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!
\v 30 Go tell them, Return to your tents.
\v 31 But as for you, stand here by Me, and I will tell you all the command, and the statutes, and the judgments, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it."
\v 32 You shall guard to do therefore as יהוה your Elohim has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\v 33 You shall walk in all the way which יהוה your Elohim has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now these are the witnesses, the statutes, and the judgments, which יהוה your Elohim commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it;
\v 2 that you might fear יהוה your Elohim, to guard all His statutes and his commands, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.
\v 3 Hear therefore, Yisra'el, and guard to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
\p
\v 4 Hear, O Yisra'el: יהוה is our Elohim; יהוה is one.
\p
\v 5 And you shall love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your being, and with all your might.
\v 6 And these words, which I command you today, shall be on your heart;
\v 7 and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall speak of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
\v 8 And you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
\v 9 And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house, and on your gates.
\p
\v 10 It shall be, when יהוה your Elohim shall bring you into the land which He swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya'aqov, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you did not build,
\v 11 and houses full of all good things, which you did not fill, and cisterns dug out, which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you did not plant, and you shall eat and be full;
\v 12 then beware lest you forget יהוה, who brought you forth out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the house of bondage.
\v 13 You shall fear יהוה your Elohim; and you shall serve Him, and shall swear by His Name.
\v 14 You shall not go after other elohim, of the elohim of the peoples who are around you;
\v 15 for יהוה your Elohim in your midst is a jealous El; lest the anger of יהוה your Elohim be kindled against you, and He destroy you from off the face of the earth.
\p
\v 16 You shall not test יהוה your Elohim, as you tested Him in Massah.
\v 17 You shall diligently guard the commands of יהוה your Elohim, and His witnesses, and His statutes, which He has commanded you.
\v 18 You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of יהוה; that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which יהוה swore to your fathers,
\v 19 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as יהוה has spoken.
\p
\v 20 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, "What do the witnesses, the statutes, and the judgments, which יהוה our Elohim has commanded you mean?"
\v 21 then you shall tell your son, "We were Pharaoh's bondservants in Mitsrayim: and יהוה brought us out of Mitsrayim with a Mighty Hand;
\v 22 and יהוה showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Mitsrayim, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;
\v 23 and He brought us out from there, that He might bring us in, to give us the land which He swore to our fathers.
\v 24 יהוה commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear יהוה our Elohim, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as at this day.
\v 25 It shall be righteousness to us, if we guard to do all this command before יהוה our Elohim, as He has commanded us."
\c 7
\p
\v 1 When יהוה your Elohim shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before you, the Ḥittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Kena'anite, and the Perizzite, and the Ḥivite, and the Yevusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you;
\v 2 and when יהוה your Elohim shall deliver them up before you, and you shall strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them: you shall cut no covenant with them, nor show favor to them;
\v 3 neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son.
\v 4 For he will turn away your son from following, that they may serve other elohim: so the anger of יהוה would be kindled against you, and He would destroy you quickly.
\v 5 But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, and dash their pillars in pieces, and cut down their Asherim, and burn their engraved images with fire.
\v 6 For you are a set-apart people to יהוה your Elohim: יהוה your Elohim has chosen you to be a people for His own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
\p
\v 7 יהוה did not set His love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples:
\v 8 but because יהוה loves you, and because He would guard the oath which He swore to your fathers, has יהוה brought you out with a Mighty Hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim.
\v 9 Know therefore that יהוה your Elohim, He is Elohim, the faithful El, who guards the covenant and loving-kindness with them who love Him and guard His commands to a thousand generations,
\v 10 and repays those who hate Him to their face, to destroy them: He will not be slack to him who hates Him, He will repay him to his face.
\v 11 You shall therefore guard the command, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command you today, to do them.
\p
\ms פרשת עקב – Parashat Eiqev
\v 12 It shall happen, because you listen to these judgments, and guard and do them, that יהוה your Elohim will guard with you the covenant and the loving-kindness which He swore to your fathers:
\v 13 and He will love you, and bless you, and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which He swore to your fathers to give you.
\v 14 You shall be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.
\v 15 יהוה will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Mitsrayim, which you know, He will put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.
\v 16 You shall consume all the peoples whom יהוה your Elohim shall deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them: neither shall you serve their elohim; for that will be a snare to you.
\p
\v 17 If you shall say in your heart, "These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?"
\v 18 you shall not be afraid of them: you shall well remember what יהוה your Elohim did to Pharaoh, and to all Mitsrayim;
\v 19 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the Mighty Hand, and the outstretched Arm, by which יהוה your Elohim brought you out: so shall יהוה your Elohim do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
\v 20 Moreover יהוה your Elohim will send the hornet among them, until those who are left hide themselves, and perish from before you.
\v 21 You shall not be scared of them; for יהוה your Elohim is in your midst, a great and awesome El.
\v 22 יהוה your Elohim will cast out those nations before you little by little: you may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.
\v 23 But יהוה your Elohim will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they be destroyed.
\v 24 He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name to perish from under the heavens: no man shall be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.
\v 25 You shall burn the engraved images of their elohim with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to יהוה your Elohim.
\v 26 You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 You shall guard to do all the command which I command you today, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which יהוה swore to your fathers.
\v 2 You shall remember all the way which יהוה your Elohim has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that He might humble you, to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would guard His commands, or not.
\v 3 He humbled you, and allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you did not know, neither did your fathers know; that He might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of יהוה does man live.
\v 4 Your clothing did not grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.
\v 5 You shall consider in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so יהוה your Elohim disciplines you.
\v 6 You shall guard the commands of יהוה your Elohim, to walk in His ways, and to fear Him.
\v 7 For יהוה your Elohim brings you into a good land, a land of wadis of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills;
\v 8 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;
\v 9 a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper.
\v 10 You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless יהוה your Elohim for the good land which He has given you.
\p
\v 11 Beware lest you forget יהוה your Elohim, in not guarding His commands, and His judgments, and His statutes, which I command you today:
\v 12 lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and lived therein;
\v 13 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;
\v 14 then your heart be lifted up, and you forget יהוה your Elohim, who brought you forth out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the house of bondage;
\v 15 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, in which were fiery naḥashim and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;
\v 16 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers did not know; that He might humble you, and that He might prove you, to do you good at your latter end:
\v 17 and lest you say in your heart, "My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth."
\p
\v 18 But you shall remember יהוה your Elohim, for it is He who gives you power to get wealth; that He may establish His covenant which He swore to your fathers [Avraham, and Yitsḥaq, and Ya'aqov], as at this day.
\v 19 It shall be, if you shall forget יהוה your Elohim, and walk after other elohim, and serve them, and bow down to them, I testify [with the heavens and the earth] against you today that you shall surely perish.
\v 20 As the nations that יהוה makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you would not listen to the voice of יהוה your Elohim.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Hear, Yisra'el: you are to pass over the Yarden today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the heavens,
\v 2 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anaqim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, "Who can stand before the sons of Anaq?"
\v 3 Know therefore today, that יהוה your Elohim is He who goes over before you as a devouring fire; He will destroy them, and He will bring them down before you: so you shall drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as יהוה has spoken to you.
\p
\v 4 Do not say in your heart, after יהוה your Elohim has thrust them out from before you, saying, "For my righteousness יהוה has brought me in to possess this land;" because יהוה drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.
\v 5 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations יהוה your Elohim does drive them out from before you, and that He may establish the word which יהוה swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya'aqov.
\p
\v 6 Know therefore, that יהוה your Elohim does not give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.
\p
\v 7 Remember, do not forget, how you provoked יהוה your Elohim to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Mitsrayim, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against יהוה.
\v 8 Also in Ḥorev you provoked יהוה to wrath, and יהוה was angry with you to destroy you.
\v 9 When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, even the tablets of the covenant which יהוה cut with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
\v 10 יהוה delivered to me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of Elohim; and on them was written according to all the words, which יהוה spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
\v 11 And it came about at the end of forty days and forty nights, that יהוה gave me the two tablets of stone, even the tablets of the covenant.
\v 12 יהוה said to me, "Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought forth out of Mitsrayim have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image."
\v 13 Furthermore יהוה spoke to me, saying, "I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:
\v 14 let Me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the heavens; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they."
\p
\v 15 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire: and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
\v 16 I looked, and behold, you had sinned against יהוה your Elohim; you had made yourselves a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which יהוה had commanded you.
\v 17 I took hold of the two tablets, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.
\v 18 I fell down before יהוה, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, to provoke Him to anger.
\v 19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which יהוה was angry against you to destroy you. But יהוה listened to me that time also.
\v 20 יהוה was very angry with Aharon to destroy him: and I prayed for Aharon also at the same time.
\v 21 I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the wadi that descended out of the mountain.
\p
\v 22 At Taverah, and at Massah, and at Qivroth Hatta'avah, you provoked יהוה to wrath.
\v 23 When יהוה sent you from Qadesh Barnea, saying, "Go up and possess the land which I have given you;" then you rebelled against the command of יהוה your Elohim, and you were not steadfast in Him, nor did you listen to His voice.
\v 24 You have been rebellious against יהוה from the day that I knew you.
\p
\v 25 So I fell down before יהוה the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because יהוה had said He would destroy you.
\v 26 I prayed to יהוה, and said, "Adonai יהוה, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance, that You have redeemed through Your greatness, that You have brought forth out of Mitsrayim with a Mighty Hand.
\v 27 Remember Your servants, Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya'aqov; do not look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,
\v 28 lest the land You brought us out from say, 'Because יהוה was not able to bring them into the land which He promised to them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.'
\v 29 Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, which You brought out by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm."
\c 10
\p
\v 1 At that time יהוה said to me, "Cut two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood.
\v 2 I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark."
\v 3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tablets of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand.
\v 4 He wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the Ten Words, which יהוה spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and יהוה gave them to me.
\v 5 I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are as יהוה commanded me.
\p
\v 6 (The children of Yisra'el traveled from Beeroth Bene Ya'akan to Moserah. There Aharon died, and there he was buried; and Elazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his place.
\v 7 From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Yotbathah, a land of wadis of water.
\v 8 At that time יהוה set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of יהוה, to stand before יהוה to minister to Him, and to bless in His Name, to this day.
\v 9 Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; יהוה is his inheritance, according as יהוה your Elohim spoke to him.)
\p
\v 10 I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and יהוה listened to me that time also; יהוה would not destroy you.
\v 11 יהוה said to me, "Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them."
\p
\v 12 Now, Yisra'el, what does יהוה your Elohim require of you, but to fear יהוה your Elohim, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve יהוה your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being,
\v 13 to guard the commands of יהוה, and His statutes, which I command you today for your good?
\v 14 Behold, to יהוה your Elohim belongs the heavens and the heaven of the heavens, and the earth, with all that is therein.
\v 15 Only יהוה had a delight in your fathers to love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.
\v 16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.
\v 17 For יהוה your Elohim, He is Elohim of elohim, and Master of masters, the great El, the mighty, and the awesome, who does not respect persons, nor takes reward.
\v 18 He does execute judgment for the fatherless and widow, and loves the sojourner, in giving him food and clothing.
\v 19 Therefore love the sojourner; for you were sojourners in the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 20 You shall fear יהוה your Elohim; you shall serve Him; and you shall cling to Him, and you shall swear by His Name.
\v 21 He is your praise, and He is your Elohim, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.
\v 22 Your fathers went down into Mitsrayim with seventy persons; and now יהוה your Elohim has made you as the stars of the heavens for multitude.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Therefore you shall love יהוה your Elohim, and guard His charge, and His statutes, and His judgments, and His commands, always.
\v 2 Know today: for I do not speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the correction of יהוה your Elohim, His greatness, His Mighty Hand, and His outstretched Arm,
\v 3 and His signs, and His works, which He did in the midst of Mitsrayim to Pharaoh the king of Mitsrayim, and to all his land;
\v 4 and what He did to the army of Mitsrayim, to their horses, and to their chariots; how He made the water of the Sea of Reeds to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how יהוה has destroyed them to this day;
\v 5 and what He did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;
\v 6 and what He did to Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav, the son of Reuven; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Yisra'el:
\v 7 but your eyes have seen all the great work of יהוה which He did.
\p
\v 8 Therefore you shall guard all the commands which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it;
\v 9 and that you may prolong your days in the land, which יהוה swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 10 For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Mitsrayim, that you came out from, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;
\v 11 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks of water of the rain of the heavens,
\v 12 a land which יהוה your Elohim cares for: the eyes of יהוה your Elohim are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
\p
\v 13 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to My commands which I command you today, to love יהוה your Elohim, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your being,
\v 14 that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil.
\v 15 I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.
\v 16 Guard yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other elohim, and bow down to them;
\v 17 and the anger of יהוה be kindled against you, and He closed up the heavens, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which יהוה gives you.
\p
\v 18 Therefore you shall lay up these My words in your heart and in your being; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
\v 19 And you shall teach them your children, speaking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
\v 20 And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house, and on your gates;
\v 21 that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which יהוה swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
\v 22 For if you shall diligently guard all this command which I command you, to do it, to love יהוה your Elohim, to walk in all His ways, and to cling to Him;
\v 23 then will יהוה drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
\v 24 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Levanon, from the river, the Perath River, even to the western sea shall be your border.
\v 25 No man shall be able to stand before you: יהוה your Elohim shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as He has spoken to you.
\p
\ms פרשת ראה – Parashat Re'eh
\v 26 Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:
\v 27 the blessing, if you shall listen to the commands of יהוה your Elohim, which I command you today;
\v 28 and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commands of יהוה your Elohim, but turn aside out of the way which I command you today, to go after other elohim, which you have not known.
\p
\v 29 It shall happen, when יהוה your Elohim shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Eyval.
\v 30 Are they not beyond the Yarden, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Kena'anites who dwell in the Aravah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
\v 31 For you are to pass over the Yarden to go in to possess the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein.
\v 32 You shall guard to do all the statutes and the judgments which I set before you today.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall guard to do in the land which יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth.
\v 2 You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their elohim, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:
\v 3 and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their elohim; and you shall destroy their name out of that place.
\v 4 You shall not do so to יהוה your Elohim.
\v 5 But to the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose out of all your tribes, to put His Name there, even to His habitation you shall seek, and there you shall come;
\v 6 and there you shall bring your ascension offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock:
\v 7 and there you shall eat before יהוה your Elohim, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which יהוה your Elohim has blessed you.
\p
\v 8 You shall not do after all the things that we do here today, every man whatever is right in his own eyes;
\v 9 for you have not yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which יהוה your Elohim gives you.
\v 10 But when you go over the Yarden, and dwell in the land which יהוה your Elohim causes you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell securely;
\v 11 then it shall happen that to the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose, to cause His Name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your ascension offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to יהוה.
\v 12 You shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your male servants, and your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
\p
\v 13 Guard yourself that you do not offer your ascension offerings in every place that you see;
\v 14 but in the place which יהוה shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your ascension offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.
\p
\v 15 Nevertheless, you may slaughter and eat flesh within all your gates, after all the desire of your being, according to the blessing of יהוה your Elohim which He has given you: the unclean person and the clean person may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart.
\v 16 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.
\v 17 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
\v 18 but you shall eat them before יהוה your Elohim in the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim in all that you put your hand to.
\v 19 Guard yourself that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
\p
\v 20 When יהוה your Elohim shall enlarge your border, as He has promised you, and you shall say, "I want to eat meat," because your being desires to eat meat; you may eat meat, after all the desire of your being.
\v 21 If the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose, to put His Name there, is too far from you, then you shall slaughter of your herd and of your flock, which יהוה has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your being.
\v 22 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it: the unclean person and the clean person may eat of it alike.
\v 23 Only be sure that you do not eat the blood: for the blood is the being; and you shall not eat the being with the flesh.
\v 24 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.
\v 25 You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of יהוה.
\v 26 Only your set-apart things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which יהוה shall choose:
\v 27 and you shall offer your ascension offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of יהוה your Elohim; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of יהוה your Elohim; and you shall eat the flesh.
\p
\v 28 Guard and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 29 When יהוה your Elohim shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land;
\v 30 guard yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before you; and that you not inquire after their elohim, saying, "How do these nations serve their elohim? I will do likewise."
\v 31 You shall not do so to יהוה your Elohim: for every abomination to יהוה, which He hates, have they done to their elohim; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their elohim.
\p
\v 32 Whatever thing I command you, that you shall guard to do: you shall not add to it, nor remove from it.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 If there arise in your midst a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give you a sign or a wonder,
\v 2 and the sign or the wonder come to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, "Let us go after other elohim" (which you have not known) "and let us serve them;"
\v 3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams: for יהוה your Elohim proves you, to know whether you love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being.
\v 4 You shall walk after יהוה your Elohim, and fear Him, and guard His commands, and obey His voice, and you shall serve Him, and cling to Him.
\v 5 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which יהוה your Elohim commanded you to walk in. So you shall put away the evil from your midst.
\p
\v 6 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, who is as your own being, entice you secretly, saying, "Let us go and serve other elohim" which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;
\v 7 of the elohim of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;
\v 8 you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him:
\v 9 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
\v 10 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the house of bondage.
\v 11 All Yisra'el shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more such evil as this is in your midst.
\p
\v 12 If you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities, which יהוה your Elohim gives you to dwell there, saying,
\v 13 "Certain sons of Beliyya'al are gone out from your midst, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, "Let us go and serve other elohim," which you have not known;
\v 14 then you shall inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in your midst,
\v 15 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and its livestock, with the edge of the sword.
\v 16 You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its street, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the entirety of its spoil, to יהוה your Elohim: and it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again.
\v 17 Nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand; that יהוה may turn from the fierceness of His anger, and show you compassion, and be compassionate to you, and multiply you, as He has sworn to your fathers;
\v 18 when you shall listen to the voice of יהוה your Elohim, to guard all His commands which I command you today, to do that which is right in the eyes of יהוה your Elohim.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 You are the children of יהוה your Elohim: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
\v 2 For you are a set-apart people to יהוה your Elohim, and יהוה has chosen you to be a people for His own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
\p
\v 3 You shall not eat any abomination.
\v 4 These are the animals which you shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
\v 5 the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the ibex, and the antelope, and the chamois.
\v 6 Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two, and chews the cud, among the animals, you shall eat.
\v 7 Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the shaphan, and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but do not part the hoof, they are unclean to you.
\v 8 The pig, because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean to you: of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch.
\p
\v 9 These you shall eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales you shall eat;
\v 10 and whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you.
\p
\v 11 Of all clean birds you shall eat.
\v 12 But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the osprey,
\v 13 and the red kite, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,
\v 14 and every raven after its kind,
\v 15 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the seagull, and the hawk after its kind,
\v 16 the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,
\v 17 and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,
\v 18 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
\v 19 All winged creeping things are unclean to you: they shall not be eaten.
\v 20 Of all clean birds you shall eat.
\p
\v 21 You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it to the sojourner living among you who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you shall sell it to a foreigner: for you are a set-apart people to יהוה your Elohim. You shall not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
\p
\v 22 You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes forth from the field year by year.
\v 23 You shall eat before יהוה your Elohim, in the place which He shall choose, to cause His Name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; so that you shall learn to fear יהוה your Elohim always.
\v 24 If the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from you, which יהוה your Elohim shall choose, to set His Name there, when יהוה your Elohim shall bless you;
\v 25 then you shall turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose:
\v 26 and you shall bestow the money for whatever your being desires, for cattle, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your being asks of you; and you shall eat there before יהוה your Elohim, and you shall rejoice, you and your household.
\v 27 The Levite who is within your gates, you shall not forsake him; for he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
\p
\v 28 At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:
\v 29 and the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, and the sojourner who dwells with you, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that יהוה your Elohim may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.
\v 2 This is the way of the release: every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because the release of יהוה has been proclaimed.
\v 3 Of a foreigner you may exact it: but whatever of yours is with your brother your hand shall release.
\v 4 However there shall be no poor with you; (for יהוה will surely bless you in the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you for an inheritance to possess it;)
\v 5 if only you diligently listen to the voice of יהוה your Elohim, to guard to do all this command which I command you today.
\v 6 For יהוה your Elohim will bless you, as He promised you: and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over you.
\p
\v 7 If a poor man, one of your brothers, is with you within any of your gates in your land which יהוה your Elohim gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother;
\v 8 but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wants.
\v 9 Beware that there not be a worthless thought in your heart, saying, "The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand;" and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cry to יהוה against you, and it be sin to you.
\v 10 You shall surely give him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him; because that for this thing יהוה your Elohim will bless you in all your work, and in all that you put your hand to do.
\v 11 For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land.
\p
\v 12 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, and serves you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.
\v 13 When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty:
\v 14 you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress; as יהוה your Elohim has blessed you, you shall give to him.
\v 15 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Mitsrayim, and יהוה your Elohim redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing today.
\v 16 It shall be, if he tells you, "I will not go out from you;" because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you;
\v 17 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise.
\p
\v 18 It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you; for to the double of the hire of a hireling has he served you six years: and יהוה your Elohim will bless you in all that you do.
\p
\v 19 All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock you shall set apart to יהוה your Elohim: you shall do no service with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
\v 20 You shall eat it before יהוה your Elohim year by year in the place which יהוה shall choose, you and your household.
\v 21 If it have any blemish, whether lame or blind, any ill blemish whatever, you shall not slaughter it to יהוה your Elohim.
\v 22 You shall eat it within your gates: the unclean person and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.
\v 23 Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on the ground as water.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Guard the new moon of the aviv, and keep the Pesaḥ to יהוה your Elohim; for in the new moon of the aviv יהוה your Elohim brought you forth out of Mitsrayim by night.
\v 2 You shall slaughter the Pesaḥ to יהוה your Elohim, of the flock and the herd, in the place which יהוה shall choose, to cause His Name to dwell there.
\v 3 You shall eat no leavened bread with it. You shall eat unleavened bread with it seven days, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Mitsrayim in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Mitsrayim all the days of your life.
\v 4 No leaven shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you slaughter the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning.
\v 5 You may not slaughter the Pesaḥ within any of your gates, which יהוה your Elohim gives you;
\v 6 but at the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose, to cause His Name to dwell in, there you shall slaughter the Pesaḥ at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the appointed time that you came forth out of Mitsrayim.
\v 7 You shall cook and eat it in the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose: and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents.
\v 8 Six days you shall eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to יהוה your Elohim; you shall do no work on it.
\p
\v 9 You shall count for yourselves seven weeks: from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks.
\v 10 You shall keep the Feast of Weeks to יהוה your Elohim with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give, according as יהוה your Elohim blesses you:
\v 11 and you shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in your midst, in the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose, to cause His Name to dwell there.
\v 12 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in Mitsrayim: and you shall guard and do these statutes.
\p
\v 13 You shall keep the Feast of Sukkot for seven days, after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress.
\v 14 And you shall rejoice in your Feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates.
\v 15 You shall keep a Feast to יהוה your Elohim seven days in the place which יהוה shall choose; because יהוה your Elohim will bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful.
\p
\v 16 Three times in a year shall all your males appear before יהוה your Elohim in the place which He shall choose: in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and in the Feast of Weeks, and in the Feast of Sukkot; and they shall not appear before יהוה empty-handed:
\v 17 every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of יהוה your Elohim which He has given you.
\p
\ms פרשת שפטים – Parashat Shofetim
\v 18 You shall make judges and officers in all your gates, which יהוה your Elohim gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
\v 19 You shall not distort judgment: you shall not respect persons; neither shall you take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
\v 20 You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live, and inherit the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you.
\p
\v 21 You shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of יהוה your Elohim, which you shall make for yourselves.
\v 22 Neither shall you set yourself up a pillar which יהוה your Elohim hates.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 You shall not slaughter to יהוה your Elohim an ox, or a sheep, in which is a blemish, or anything evil; for that is an abomination to יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 2 If there be found in your midst, within any of your gates which יהוה your Elohim gives you, man or woman, who does that which is evil in the eyes of יהוה your Elohim, in transgressing His covenant,
\v 3 and has gone and served other elohim, and bowed down to them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the army of the heavens, which I have not commanded;
\v 4 and it be told you, and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire diligently; and behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Yisra'el,
\v 5 then you shall bring forth that man or that woman, who has done this evil thing, to your gates, even the man or the woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones.
\v 6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he who is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.
\v 7 The hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall put away the evil from your midst.
\p
\v 8 If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates; then you shall arise, and go up to the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose;
\v 9 and you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days: and you shall inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment.
\v 10 You shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which יהוה shall choose; and you shall guard to do according to all that they shall teach you:
\v 11 according to the tenor of the Torah which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the words which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.
\v 12 The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before יהוה your Elohim, or to the judge, even that man shall die: and you shall put away the evil from Yisra'el.
\v 13 All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
\p
\v 14 When you come to the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, "I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me;"
\v 15 you shall surely set him king over yourselves, whom יהוה your Elohim shall choose: one from among your brothers you shall set king over you; you may not put a foreign man over you, who is not your brother.
\v 16 Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Mitsrayim, to the end that he may multiply horses; because יהוה has said to you, "You shall not go back that way again."
\v 17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart not turn away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
\p
\v 18 It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this Torah in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites:
\v 19 and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear יהוה his Elohim, to guard all the words of this Torah and these statutes, to do them;
\v 20 that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn aside from the command, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Yisra'el.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 The priests the Levites, even all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Yisra'el: they shall eat the offerings of יהוה made by fire, and his inheritance.
\v 2 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers: יהוה is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them.
\p
\v 3 This shall be the priests' judgment from the people, from those who slaughter a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.
\v 4 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.
\v 5 For יהוה your Elohim has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the Name of יהוה, him and his sons for ever.
\p
\v 6 If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Yisra'el, where he sojourned, and comes with all the desire of his being to the place which יהוה shall choose;
\v 7 then he shall minister in the Name of יהוה his Elohim, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before יהוה.
\v 8 They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes of the sale of his patrimony.
\p
\v 9 When you come into the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you, you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
\v 10 There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,
\v 11 or a charmer, or a medium, or a wizard, or a necromancer who brings up the dead.
\v 12 For whoever does these things is an abomination to יהוה: and because of these abominations יהוה your Elohim does drive them out from before you.
\v 13 You shall be perfect with יהוה your Elohim.
\v 14 For these nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice sorcery, and to diviners; but as for you, יהוה your Elohim has not allowed you so to do.
\p
\v 15 יהוה your Elohim will raise up to you a prophet from your midst, of your brothers, like me. You shall hear him.
\v 16 This is according to all that you desired of יהוה your Elohim in Ḥorev in the day of the assembly, saying, "Let me not hear again the voice of יהוה my Elohim, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die."
\v 17 יהוה said to me, "They have well said that which they have spoken.
\v 18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you. And I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.
\v 19 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My Name, I will require it of him.
\v 20 But the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in My Name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak in the name of other elohim, that same prophet shall die."
\v 21 If you say in your heart, "How shall we know the word which יהוה has not spoken?"
\v 22 when a prophet speaks in the Name of יהוה, if the thing does not follow, nor happen, that is the thing which יהוה has not spoken: the prophet has spoken it presumptuously, you shall not be afraid of him.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 When יהוה your Elohim shall cut off the nations, whose land יהוה your Elohim gives you, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;
\v 2 you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the midst of your land, which יהוה your Elohim gives you to possess it.
\v 3 You shall prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land, which יהוה your Elohim causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee there.
\p
\v 4 This is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live: whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and did not hate him in time past;
\v 5 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and lights on his neighbor, so that he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live:
\v 6 lest the avenger of blood pursue the murderer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike his being mortally; pronouncing a judgment of death, inasmuch as he did not hate him in time past.
\v 7 Therefore I command you, saying, You shall set apart three cities for yourselves.
\p
\v 8 If יהוה your Elohim enlarges your border, as He has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which He promised to give to your fathers;
\v 9 if you guard all this command to do it, which I command you today, to love יהוה your Elohim, and to walk ever in His ways; then you shall add three cities more for yourselves, besides these three:
\v 10 that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land, which יהוה your Elohim gives you for an inheritance, and so blood be on you.
\p
\v 11 But if any man hates his neighbor, and lies in wait for him, and rises up against him, and strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities;
\v 12 then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
\v 13 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the innocent blood from Yisra'el, that it may go well with you.
\p
\v 14 You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that יהוה your Elohim gives you to possess it.
\p
\v 15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.
\v 16 If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing,
\v 17 then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before יהוה, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;
\v 18 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;
\v 19 then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother: so you shall put away the evil from your midst.
\v 20 Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in your midst.
\v 21 Your eyes shall not pity; being for being, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses, and chariots, and a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for יהוה your Elohim is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Mitsrayim.
\v 2 It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,
\v 3 and shall tell them, "Hear, Yisra'el, you draw near today to battle against your enemies: do not let your heart faint; do not be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;
\v 4 for יהוה your Elohim is He who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."
\v 5 The officers shall speak to the people, saying, "What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
\v 6 What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit.
\v 7 What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her."
\v 8 The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, "What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brother's heart melt as his heart."
\v 9 It shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people.
\p
\v 10 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.
\v 11 It shall be, if it makes you answer of peace, and opens to you, then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you.
\v 12 If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it:
\v 13 and when יהוה your Elohim delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword:
\v 14 but the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its spoil, you shall plunder to yourself; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which יהוה your Elohim has given you.
\v 15 Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.
\v 16 But of the cities of these peoples, that יהוה your Elohim gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that has breath;
\v 17 but you shall utterly destroy them: the Ḥittite, and the Amorite, the Kena'anite, and the Perizzite, the Ḥivite, and the Yevusite; as יהוה your Elohim has commanded you;
\v 18 that they not teach you to do after all their abominations, which they have done to their elohim; so would you sin against יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 19 When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of you?
\v 20 Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it fall.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 If one be found slain in the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you to possess it, lying in the field, and it is not known who has struck him;
\v 2 then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain:
\v 3 and it shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not worked in service, and which has not drawn in the yoke;
\v 4 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a wadi with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the wadi.
\v 5 The priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for יהוה your Elohim has chosen them to minister to Him, and to bless in the Name of יהוה; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.
\v 6 All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the wadi;
\v 7 and they shall answer and say, "Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
\v 8 Cover, יהוה, Your people Yisra'el, whom You have redeemed, and do not allow innocent blood to remain in the midst of Your people Yisra'el." The blood shall be covered for them.
\v 9 So you shall put away the innocent blood from your midst, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of יהוה.
\p
\ms פרשת כי תצא – Parashat Ki Teitsei
\v 10 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and יהוה your Elohim delivers them into your hands, and you carry them away captive,
\v 11 and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have a desire to her, and would take her to you as wife;
\v 12 then you shall bring her home to your house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;
\v 13 and she shall put the clothing of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a month of days: and after that you shall go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
\v 14 It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go for her being; but you shall not sell her at all for money, you shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her.
\p
\v 15 If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have brought forth children to him, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated;
\v 16 then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn:
\v 17 but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength; the judgment of the firstborn is his.
\p
\v 18 If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they discipline him, will not listen to them;
\v 19 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place;
\v 20 and they shall tell the elders of his city, "This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard."
\v 21 All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so you shall put away the evil from your midst; and all Yisra'el shall hear, and fear.
\p
\v 22 If a man has committed a sin judged worthy of death, and he be put to death, and you hang him on a tree;
\v 23 his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of Elohim; that you do not defile your land which יהוה your Elohim gives you for an inheritance.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely bring them again to your brother.
\v 2 If your brother is not near to you, or if you do not know him, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall restore it to him.
\v 3 So you shall do with his donkey; and so you shall do with his garment; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found: you may not hide yourself.
\v 4 You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again.
\p
\v 5 A woman shall not wear men's clothing, neither shall a man put on women's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 6 If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young:
\v 7 you shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take to yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.
\p
\v 8 When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you do not bring blood on your house, if any man fall from there.
\p
\v 9 You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.
\p
\v 10 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
\p
\v 11 You shall not wear a mixed stuff, wool and linen together.
\p
\v 12 You shall make yourselves tassels on the four borders of your cloak, with which you cover yourself.
\p
\v 13 If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her,
\v 14 and accuses her of shameful things, and brings up an evil name on her, and says, "I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I did not find in her the tokens of virginity;"
\v 15 then shall the father of the maiden, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the maiden's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate;
\v 16 and the maiden's father shall tell the elders, "I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her;
\v 17 and behold, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, 'I did not find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;' and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity." They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
\v 18 The elders of that city shall take the man and discipline him;
\v 19 and they shall fine him one hundred sheqels of silver, and give them to the father of the maiden, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Yisra'el: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
\p
\v 20 But if this thing be true, that the signs of virginity were not found in the maiden;
\v 21 then they shall bring out the maiden to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done a senseless thing in Yisra'el, to whore in her father's house: so you shall put away the evil from your midst.
\p
\v 22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman: so you shall put away the evil from Yisra'el.
\p
\v 23 If there is a maiden who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lies with her;
\v 24 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the maiden, because she did not cry out, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife: so you shall put away the evil from your midst.
\p
\v 25 But if the man found the maiden who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only who did lie with her shall die:
\v 26 but to the maiden you shall do nothing; there is in the maiden no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter;
\v 27 for he found her in the field, the pledged-to-be-married maiden cried, and there was none to save her.
\p
\v 28 If a man find a maiden who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;
\v 29 then the man who did lie with her shall give to the maiden's father fifty sheqels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.
\p
\v 30 A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his father's skirt.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 He who is crushed, wounded, or cut off in his privy member shall not enter into the assembly of יהוה.
\v 2 A mamzer shall not enter into the assembly of יהוה; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of יהוה.
\v 3 An Ammonite or a Moavite shall not enter into the assembly of יהוה; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of יהוה forever:
\v 4 because they did not meet you with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Mitsrayim, and because they hired against you Bil'am the son of Beor from Pethor of Aram-Naharayim, to curse you.
\v 5 Nevertheless יהוה your Elohim would not listen to Bil'am; but יהוה your Elohim turned the curse into a blessing to you, because יהוה your Elohim loved you.
\v 6 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever.
\p
\v 7 You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother: you shall not abhor a Mitsrite, because you lived as a sojourner in his land.
\v 8 The children of the third generation who are born to them shall enter into the assembly of יהוה.
\p
\v 9 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you shall guard yourselves from every evil thing.
\p
\v 10 If there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night, then shall he go outside of the camp. He shall not come within the camp:
\v 11 but it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come within the camp.
\p
\v 12 You shall have a place also outside of the camp, where you shall go forth abroad:
\v 13 and you shall have a spade among your tools; and it shall be, when you squat down outside, you shall dig with the spade, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you:
\v 14 for יהוה your Elohim walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you; therefore your camp shall be set-apart, that He may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.
\p
\v 15 You shall not deliver a servant to his master who escaped from his master to you:
\v 16 he shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best: you shall not oppress him.
\p
\v 17 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Yisra'el, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Yisra'el.
\v 18 You shall not bring the hire of a whore, or the wages of a dog, into the house of יהוה your Elohim for any vow: for even both of these are an abomination to יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 19 You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest:
\v 20 to a foreigner you may lend on interest; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest, that יהוה your Elohim may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it.
\p
\v 21 When you shall vow a vow to יהוה your Elohim, you shall not be slack to pay it: for יהוה your Elohim will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.
\v 22 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you.
\v 23 That which is gone out of your lips you shall guard and do; according as you have vowed to יהוה your Elohim, a freewill offering, which you have promised with your mouth.
\p
\v 24 When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel.
\p
\v 25 When you come into your neighbor's standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it shall be, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some nakedness in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
\v 2 When she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife.
\v 3 If the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;
\v 4 her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before יהוה: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which יהוה your Elohim gives you for an inheritance.
\p
\v 5 When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither shall he be assigned any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall give gladness to his wife whom he has taken.
\p
\v 6 No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he takes a man's being to pledge.
\p
\v 7 If a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Yisra'el, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so you shall put away the evil from your midst.
\p
\v 8 Take heed in the plague of leprosy that you guard diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so you shall observe to do.
\v 9 Remember what יהוה your Elohim did to Miryam, by the way as you came forth out of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 10 When you do lend your neighbor any kind of loan, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge.
\v 11 You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you.
\v 12 If he be a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge;
\v 13 you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you: and it shall be righteousness to you before יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 14 You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he be of your brothers, or of your sojourners who are in your land within your gates:
\v 15 in his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it – for he is poor, and sets his being on it – lest he cry against you to יהוה, and it be sin to you.
\p
\v 16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
\p
\v 17 You shall not distort judgment to the sojourner, or to the fatherless, nor take the widow's clothing to pledge;
\v 18 but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Mitsrayim, and יהוה your Elohim redeemed you there: therefore I command you to do this thing.
\p
\v 19 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that יהוה your Elohim may bless you in all the work of your hands.
\v 20 When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
\p
\v 21 When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it after yourselves: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
\v 22 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Mitsrayim: therefore I command you to do this thing.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 If there be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment, and the judges judge them; then they shall declare the righteous right, and condemn the wicked;
\v 2 and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by number.
\v 3 Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should be degraded to you.
\p
\v 4 You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain.
\p
\v 5 If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a foreigner: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him as wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.
\v 6 It shall be, that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name not be blotted out of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 7 If the man does not want to take his brother's wife, then his brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say, "My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother a name in Yisra'el; he will not perform the duty of a husband's brother to me."
\v 8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him: and if he stand, and say, "I do not want to take her;"
\v 9 then his brother's wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall answer and say, "So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his brother's house."
\v 10 His name shall be called in Yisra'el, the house of him who has his shoe loosed.
\p
\v 11 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him, and puts forth her hand, and takes him by the genitals;
\v 12 then you shall cut off her hand, your eye shall have no pity.
\p
\v 13 You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, a great and a small.
\v 14 You shall not have in your house diverse measures, a great and a small.
\v 15 You shall have a perfect and just weight. You shall have a perfect and just measure, that your days may be long in the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you.
\v 16 For all who do such things, even all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 17 Remember what Amaleq did to you by the way as you came forth out of Mitsrayim;
\v 18 how he met you by the way, and struck the hindmost of you, all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and he did not fear Elohim.
\v 19 Therefore it shall be, when יהוה your Elohim has given you rest from all your enemies all around, in the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you shall blot out the memory of Amaleq from under the heavens; you shall not forget.
\c 26
פרשת כי תבוא – Parashat Ki Tavo
\p
\v 1 It shall be, when you come in to the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you for an inheritance, and possess it, and dwell therein,
\v 2 that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land that יהוה your Elohim gives you; and you shall put it in a basket, and shall go to the place which יהוה your Elohim shall choose, to cause His Name to dwell there.
\v 3 You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days, and tell him, "I profess today to יהוה your Elohim, that I am come to the land which יהוה swore to our fathers to give us."
\v 4 The priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before the altar of יהוה your Elohim.
\v 5 You shall answer and say before יהוה your Elohim, "My father was an Aramean ready to perish; and he went down into Mitsrayim, and lived there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous.
\v 6 The Mitsrites dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid on us harsh service:
\v 7 and we cried to יהוה, the Elohim of our fathers, and יהוה heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression;
\v 8 and יהוה brought us forth out of Mitsrayim with a Mighty Hand, and with an outstretched Arm, and with great terror, and with signs, and with wonders;
\v 9 and He has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 10 Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which You, יהוה, have given me." You shall set it down before יהוה your Elohim, and bow down before יהוה your Elohim.
\v 11 You shall rejoice in all the good which יהוה your Elohim has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite, and the sojourner who is in your midst.
\p
\v 12 And when you have finished tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled.
\v 13 You shall say before יהוה your Elohim, "I have put away the set-apart things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all Your command which You have commanded me: I have not transgressed any of Your commands, neither have I forgotten them:
\v 14 I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I put away of it, being unclean, nor given of it for the dead: I have listened to the voice of יהוה my Elohim; I have done according to all that You have commanded me.
\v 15 Look down from Your set-apart habitation, from the heavens, and bless Your people Yisra'el, and the ground which You have given us, as You swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey."
\p
\v 16 This day יהוה your Elohim commands you to do these statutes and judgments: you shall therefore guard and do them with all your heart, and with all your being.
\v 17 You have declared יהוה today to be your Elohim, and that you would walk in His ways, and guard His statutes, and His commands, and His judgments, and listen to His voice:
\v 18 and יהוה has declared you today to be a people for His own possession, as He has promised you, and that you should guard all His commands;
\v 19 and to make you high above all nations that He has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be a set-apart people to יהוה your Elohim, as He has spoken.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 Mosheh and the elders of Yisra'el commanded the people, saying, "Guard all the commands which I command you today.
\v 2 It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Yarden to the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you, that you shall set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
\v 3 and you shall write on them all the words of this Torah, when you have passed over; that you may go in to the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, has promised you.
\v 4 It shall be, when you have passed over the Yarden, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you today, in Mount Eyval, and you shall plaster them with plaster.
\v 5 There you shall build an altar to יהוה your Elohim, an altar of stones: you shall lift up no iron tool on them.
\v 6 You shall build the altar of יהוה your Elohim of uncut stones; and you shall offer ascension offerings thereon to יהוה your Elohim:
\v 7 and you shall slaughter peace offerings, and shall eat there; and you shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim.
\v 8 You shall write on the stones all the words of this Torah very plainly."
\p
\v 9 Mosheh and the priests the Levites spoke to all Yisra'el, saying, "Keep silence, and listen, Yisra'el: today you have become the people of יהוה your Elohim.
\v 10 You shall therefore obey the voice of יהוה your Elohim, and do His commands and His statutes, which I command you today."
\p
\v 11 Mosheh commanded the people the same day, saying,
\v 12 "These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you have passed over the Yarden: Shimon, and Levi, and Yehudah, and Yissakhar, and Yoseph, and Benyamin.
\v 13 These shall stand on Mount Eyval for the curse: Reuven, Gad, and Asher, and Zevulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
\v 14 The Levites shall answer, and tell all the men of Yisra'el with a loud voice,
\p
\v 15 'Cursed is the man who makes an engraved or molten image, an abomination to יהוה, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret.' All the people shall answer and say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 16 'Cursed is he who degrades his father or his mother.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 17 'Cursed is he who removes his neighbor's landmark.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 18 'Cursed is he who makes the blind to wander out of the way.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 19 'Cursed is he who distorts judgment to the sojourner, fatherless, and widow.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 20 'Cursed is he who lies with his father's wife, because he has uncovered his father's skirt.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 21 'Cursed is he who lies with any kind of animal.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 22 'Cursed is he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 23 'Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 24 'Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 25 'Cursed is he who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'
\p
\v 26 'Cursed is he who does not confirm the words of this Torah to do them.' All the people shall say, 'Amein.'"
\c 28
\p
\v 1 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to the voice of יהוה your Elohim, to guard to do all His commands which I command you today, that יהוה your Elohim will set you on high above all the nations of the earth:
\v 2 and all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you, if you shall listen to the voice of יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 3 You shall be blessed in the city, and you shall be blessed in the field.
\p
\v 4 You shall be blessed in the fruit of your belly, the fruit of your ground, the fruit of your animals, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock.
\p
\v 5 Your basket and your kneading trough shall be blessed.
\p
\v 6 You shall be blessed when you come in, and you shall be blessed when you go out.
\p
\v 7 יהוה will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you. They will come out against you one way, and will flee before you seven ways.
\v 8 יהוה will command the blessing on you in your barns, and in all that you put your hand to; and He will bless you in the land which יהוה your Elohim gives you.
\v 9 יהוה will establish you for a set-apart people to Himself, as He has sworn to you; if you shall guard the commands of יהוה your Elohim, and walk in His ways.
\p
\v 10 All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the Name of יהוה; and they shall be afraid of you.
\v 11 יהוה will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your belly, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land which יהוה swore to your fathers to give you.
\v 12 יהוה will open to you His good treasure in the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand: and you shall lend to many nations, and you shall not borrow.
\v 13 יהוה will make you the head, and not the tail; and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath; if you shall listen to the commands of יהוה your Elohim, which I command you today, to guard and to do them,
\v 14 and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you today, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other elohim to serve them.
\p
\v 15 But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice of יהוה your Elohim, to guard to do all His commands and His statutes which I command you today, that all these curses shall come on you, and overtake you.
\p
\v 16 You shall be cursed in the city, and you shall be cursed in the field.
\p
\v 17 Your basket and your kneading trough shall be cursed.
\p
\v 18 The fruit of your belly, the fruit of your ground, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock shall be cursed.
\p
\v 19 You shall be cursed when you come in, and you shall be cursed when you go out.
\p
\v 20 יהוה will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke, in all that you put your hand to do, until you are destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your doings, by which you have forsaken Me.
\v 21 יהוה will make the pestilence cling to you, until it has consumed you from off the land, where you go in to possess it.
\v 22 יהוה will strike you with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with blight, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.
\v 23 Your heavens that is over your head shall be copper, and the earth that is under you shall be iron.
\v 24 יהוה will make the rain of your land powder and dust: from the heavens shall it come down on you, until you are destroyed.
\p
\v 25 יהוה will cause you to be struck before your enemies; you shall go out one way against them, and shall flee seven ways before them: and you shall be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.
\v 26 Your dead body shall be food to all birds of the heavens, and to the animals of the earth; and there shall be none to frighten them away.
\p
\v 27 יהוה will strike you with the boil of Mitsrayim, and with the tumors, and with the eczema, and with the itch, of which you cannot be healed.
\v 28 יהוה will strike you with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart;
\v 29 and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways: and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always, and there shall be none to save you.
\p
\v 30 You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not use its fruit.
\v 31 Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall not eat of it: your donkey shall be violently taken away from before your face, and shall not be restored to you: your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have none to save you.
\v 32 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people; and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day: and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand.
\v 33 The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation which you do not know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always;
\v 34 so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.
\v 35 יהוה will strike you in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
\v 36 יהוה will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you, to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other elohim, wood and stone.
\v 37 You shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where יהוה shall lead you away.
\p
\v 38 You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather little in; for the locust shall consume it.
\v 39 You shall plant and serve vineyards, but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worm shall eat them.
\v 40 You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive shall cast its fruit.
\v 41 You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity.
\v 42 All your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess.
\v 43 The sojourner who is in your midst shall mount up above you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.
\v 44 He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
\p
\v 45 All these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you, and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you did not listen to the voice of יהוה your Elohim, to guard His commands and His statutes which He commanded you:
\v 46 and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder, and on your seed forever.
\p
\v 47 Because you did not serve יהוה your Elohim with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;
\v 48 therefore you shall serve your enemies whom יהוה shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and He shall put a yoke of iron on your neck, until He has destroyed you.
\p
\v 49 יהוה will bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language you shall not understand;
\v 50 a nation of fierce facial expressions, that shall not respect the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,
\v 51 and shall eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed; that also shall not leave you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.
\v 52 They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, on which you relied, throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which יהוה your Elohim has given you.
\v 53 You shall eat the fruit of your own belly, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom יהוה your Elohim has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you.
\p
\v 54 The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining;
\v 55 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.
\v 56 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
\v 57 and toward the afterbirth which comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your gates.
\p
\v 58 If you will not guard to do all the words of this Torah that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful Name, יהוה Your Elohim;
\v 59 then יהוה will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great and firm plagues, and severe and firm sicknesses.
\v 60 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Mitsrayim, which you were afraid of; and they shall cling to you.
\v 61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this Torah, יהוה will bring them on you, until you are destroyed.
\v 62 You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of the heavens for multitude; because you did not listen to the voice of יהוה your Elohim.
\p
\v 63 It shall happen that as יהוה rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so יהוה will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it.
\v 64 יהוה will scatter you among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth; and there you shall serve other elohim, which you have not known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.
\v 65 Among these nations you shall find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot: but יהוה will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of being;
\v 66 and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and shall not be faithful in life.
\v 67 In the morning you shall say, "Oh that it were evening!" and at evening you shall say, "Oh that it were morning!" for the fear of your heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.
\p
\v 68 יהוה will bring you into Mitsrayim again with ships, by the way of which I said to you, "You shall see it no more again:" and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 These are the words of the covenant which יהוה commanded Mosheh to cut with the children of Yisra'el in the land of Moav, besides the covenant which He cut with them in Ḥorev.
\p
\v 2 Mosheh called to all Yisra'el, and said to them, "You have seen all that יהוה did before your eyes in the land of Mitsrayim to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
\v 3 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:
\v 4 but יהוה has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.
\p
\v 5 "I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes have not grown old on you, and your shoes have not grown old on your feet.
\v 6 You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am יהוה your Elohim.
\v 7 When you came to this place, Siḥon the king of Ḥeshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we struck them:
\v 8 and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reuvenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Menashites.
\v 9 Guard therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
\p
\ms פרשת נצבים – Parashat Nitsavim
\v 10 You stand today all of you before יהוה your Elohim; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Yisra'el,
\v 11 your little ones, your wives, and your sojourner who is in the midst of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water;
\v 12 that you may enter into the covenant of יהוה your Elohim, and into His oath, which יהוה your Elohim cuts with you today;
\v 13 that He may establish you today to Himself for a people, and that He may be to you an Elohim, as He spoke to you, and as He swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya'aqov.
\p
\v 14 Neither with you only do I cut this covenant and this oath,
\v 15 but with him who stands here with us today before יהוה our Elohim, and also with him who is not here with us today
\v 16 (for you know how we lived in the land of Mitsrayim, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed;
\v 17 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
\v 18 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away today from יהוה our Elohim, to go to serve the elohim of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;
\v 19 and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, "I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry."
\p
\v 20 יהוה will not pardon him, but then the anger of יהוה and His jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him, and יהוה will blot out his name from under the heavens.
\v 21 יהוה will separate him to evil out of all the tribes of Yisra'el, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the Torah.
\p
\v 22 The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a faraway land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which יהוה has made it sick;
\v 23 and that the whole land of it is sulfur, and salt, and a burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sedom and Gomorrah, Admah and Tsevoyim, which יהוה overthrew in His anger, and in His wrath:
\v 24 even all the nations shall say, "Why has יהוה done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?"
\v 25 Then men shall say, "Because they forsook the covenant of יהוה, the Elohim of their fathers, which He cut with them when He brought them forth out of the land of Mitsrayim,
\v 26 and they went and served other elohim, and bowed down to them, to elohim that they did not know, and that He had not given to them.
\v 27 Therefore the anger of יהוה was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book;
\v 28 and יהוה rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day."
\p
\v 29 The secret things belong to יהוה our Elohim; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this Torah.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, that you shall return them to your heart among all the nations where יהוה your Elohim has driven you,
\v 2 and shall return to יהוה your Elohim, and shall obey His voice according to all that I command you today, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your being;
\v 3 that then יהוה your Elohim will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples, where יהוה your Elohim has scattered you.
\v 4 If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there will יהוה your Elohim gather you, and from there He will bring you back.
\v 5 And יהוה your Elohim will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will do good to you, and multiply you above your fathers.
\p
\v 6 יהוה your Elohim will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your being, that you may live.
\v 7 יהוה your Elohim will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
\v 8 You shall return and obey the voice of יהוה, and do all His commands which I command you today.
\v 9 יהוה your Elohim will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your belly, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good: for יהוה will again rejoice over you for good, as He rejoiced over your fathers;
\v 10 if you shall obey the voice of יהוה your Elohim, to guard His commands and His statutes which are written in this book of the Torah; if you turn to יהוה your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your being.
\p
\v 11 For this command which I command you today, it is not too hard for you, neither is it far off.
\v 12 It is not in heavens, that you should say, "Who shall go up for us to the heavens, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?"
\v 13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, "Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?"
\v 14 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, [and in your hand] that you may do it.
\p
\v 15 Behold, I have set before you today life and good, and death and evil;
\v 16 in that I command you today to love יהוה your Elohim, to walk in His ways, and to guard His commands and His statutes and His judgments, that you may live and multiply, and that יהוה your Elohim may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it.
\v 17 But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and bow down to other elohim, and serve them;
\v 18 I have declared to you today, that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass over the Yarden to go in to possess it.
\v 19 I call the heavens and the earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed;
\v 20 to love יהוה your Elohim, to obey His voice, and to cling to Him; for He is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which יהוה swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya'aqov, to give them.
\c 31
פרשת וילך – Parashat Vayelekh
\p
\v 1 Mosheh went and spoke these words to all Yisra'el.
\v 2 He said to them, "I am one hundred twenty years old today; I can no more go out and come in: and יהוה has said to me, 'You shall not go over this Yarden.'
\v 3 יהוה your Elohim, He will go over before you; He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them: and Yehoshua, he shall go over before you, as יהוה has spoken.
\v 4 יהוה will do to them as he did to Siḥon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land; whom He destroyed.
\v 5 יהוה will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the command which I have commanded you.
\v 6 Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid, nor be scared of them: for יהוה your Elohim, He it is who does go with you; He will not fail you, nor forsake you."
\p
\v 7 Mosheh called to Yehoshua, and said to him in the sight of all Yisra'el, "Be strong and courageous: for you shall go with this people into the land which יהוה has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.
\v 8 יהוה, He it is who does go before you; He will be with you, He will not fail you, neither forsake you: do not be afraid, neither be dismayed."
\p
\v 9 Mosheh wrote this Torah, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה, and to all the elders of Yisra'el.
\v 10 Mosheh commanded them, saying, "At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the Feast of Sukkot,
\v 11 when all Yisra'el is come to appear before יהוה your Elohim in the place which He shall choose, you shall read this Torah before all Yisra'el in their hearing.
\v 12 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and your sojourner who is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear יהוה your Elohim, and guard to do all the words of this Torah;
\v 13 and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear יהוה your Elohim, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Yarden to possess it."
\p
\v 14 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Yehoshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Appointment, that I may commission him." Mosheh and Yehoshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Appointment.
\v 15 יהוה appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
\v 16 יהוה said to Mosheh, "Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and whore after the strange elohim of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake Me, and break My covenant which I have cut with them.
\v 17 Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, 'Have not these evils come on us because our Elohim is not among us?'
\v 18 I will surely hide My face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other elohim.
\p
\v 19 "Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Yisra'el: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me with the children of Yisra'el.
\v 20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to other elohim, and serve them, and despise Me, and break My covenant.
\v 21 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their inclination which they go about today, before I have brought them into the land which I swore."
\v 22 So Mosheh wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 23 He commissioned Yehoshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Yisra'el into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you."
\p
\v 24 And it came about, when Mosheh finished writing the words of this Torah in a book, until they were complete,
\v 25 that Mosheh commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה, saying,
\v 26 "Take this book of the Torah, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of יהוה your Elohim, that it may be there for a witness against you.
\v 27 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you today, you have been rebellious against יהוה; and how much more after my death?
\v 28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, [and your judges] and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and cause the heavens and the earth to witness against them.
\v 29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of יהוה, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands."
\p
\v 30 Mosheh spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Yisra'el the words of this song, until they were finished.
\c 32
פרשת האזינו – Parashat Ha'azinu
\p
\v 1 Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak. Let the earth hear the speeches of my mouth.
\p
\v 2 My teaching shall drop as the rain. My speeches shall condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass, as the showers on the herb.
\p
\v 3 For I will proclaim the Name of יהוה. Ascribe greatness to our Elohim!
\p
\v 4 The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are judgment: a faithful El, without unrighteousness, just and right is He.
\p
\v 5 They have dealt corruptly with Him, they are not His children, it is their blemish. They are a perverse and crooked generation.
\p
\v 6 Do you thus repay יהוה, foolish people and unwise? Is He not your father who has bought you? He has made you, and established you.
\p
\v 7 Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.
\p
\v 8 When Elyon gave to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the children of men, He set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 9 For the portion of יהוה is His people. Ya'aqov is the lot of His inheritance.
\p
\v 10 He found him in a desert land, in the formless, howling wilderness. He surrounded him. He cared for him. He preserved him as the little man of His eye.
\p
\v 11 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young, He spread abroad His wings, He took them, He bore them on His feathers.
\p
\v 12 יהוה alone led him. There was no foreign el with him.
\p
\v 13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth. He ate the increase of the field. He caused him to suck honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;
\p
\v 14 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat. Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.
\p
\v 15 But Yeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then he forsook Eloah who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
\p
\v 16 They moved Him to jealousy with strange elohim. They provoked Him to anger with abominations.
\p
\v 17 They slaughtered to demons, not Eloah, to elohim that they did not know, to new things that came up of late, which your fathers did not dread.
\p
\v 18 Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful, and have forgotten El who gave you birth.
\p
\v 19 יהוה saw it, and abhorred them, because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters.
\p
\v 20 He said, "I will hide My face from them. I will see what their end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.
\p
\v 21 "They have moved Me to jealousy with that which is not El. They have provoked Me to anger with their vanities. I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
\p
\v 22 "For a fire is kindled in My anger, it burns to the lowest Sheol, devours the earth with its increase, and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.
\p
\v 23 "I will heap evils on them. I will spend My arrows on them.
\p
\v 24 "They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of animals on them, with the poison of crawling things of the dust.
\p
\v 25 "Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the rooms, terror; on both young man and virgin, the nursing infant with the gray-haired man.
\p
\v 26 "I said I would scatter them afar. I would make the memory of them to cease from among men;
\p
\v 27 were it not that I dwelt on the taunt of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say, 'Our hand is exalted, יהוה has not done all this.'"
\p
\v 28 For they are a nation void of counsel. There is no understanding in them.
\p
\v 29 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
\p
\v 30 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and יהוה had delivered them up?
\p
\v 31 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
\p
\v 32 For their vine is of the vine of Sedom, of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter.
\p
\v 33 Their wine is the poison of serpents, the cruel venom of asps.
\p
\v 34 "Is this not laid up in store with Me, sealed up among My treasures?
\p
\v 35 "Vengeance is Mine, and recompense, at the time when their foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand. The things that are to come on them shall make haste."
\p
\v 36 For יהוה will judge His people, and have compassion on His servants, when He sees that their power is gone; there is none remaining, closed up or left at large.
\p
\v 37 He will say, "Where are their elohim, the rock in which they took refuge,
\p
\v 38 "which ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you! Let them be your protection.
\p
\v 39 "See now that I, even I, am He, there are no elohim with Me. I kill, and I make alive. I wound, and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of My hand.
\p
\v 40 "For I lift up My hand to heavens and say, 'As I live forever,
\p
\v 41 "'if I whet My glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to My adversaries, and will recompense those who hate Me.
\p
\v 42 "'I will make My arrows drunk with blood. My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy.
\p
\v 43 "'Rejoice, you nations, with His people, [and let all the messengers of Elohim bow down to Him], for He will avenge the blood of His servants. He will render vengeance to His adversaries, and will make atonement for His land, for His people.'"
\p
\v 44 Mosheh came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun.
\v 45 And Mosheh finished speaking all these words to all Yisra'el.
\v 46 And he said to them, "Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you today, which you shall command your children to guard to do, even all the words of this Torah.
\v 47 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Yarden to possess it."
\p
\v 48 יהוה spoke to Mosheh that same day, saying,
\v 49 "Go up into this mountain of Avarim, to Mount Nevo, which is in the land of Moav, that is over against Yeriḥo; and see the land of Kena'an, which I give to the children of Yisra'el for a possession;
\v 50 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aharon your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:
\v 51 because you trespassed against Me in the midst of the children of Yisra'el at the waters of Merivah of Qadesh, in the wilderness of Tsin; because you did not set Me apart in the midst of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 52 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Yisra'el."
\c 33

\p
\v 1 This is the blessing, with which Mosheh the man of Elohim blessed the children of Yisra'el before his death.
\p
\v 2 He said, "יהוה came from Sinai, and rose from Seir to them. He shone forth from Mount Paran. He came from the ten thousands of set-apart ones. At His right hand was a fiery decree for them.
\p
\v 3 "Yes, He loves the people. All His set-apart ones are in Your hand. And they, they sat down at Your feet; everyone shall receive of Your words.
\p
\v 4 "Mosheh commanded us a Torah, an inheritance for the assembly of Ya'aqov.
\p
\v 5 "He was king in Yeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Yisra'el together."
\p
\v 6 "Let Reuven live, and not die; nor let his men be few."
\p
\v 7 This is the blessing of Yehudah: and he said, "Hear, יהוה, the voice of Yehudah. Bring him in to his people. With his hands he contended for himself. You shall be a help against his adversaries."
\p
\v 8 Of Levi he said, "Your Thummim and Your Urim are with Your kind one, whom You proved at Massah, with whom You strove at the waters of Merivah;
\v 9 who said of his father, and of his mother, 'I have not seen him;' neither did he acknowledge his brothers, nor did he know his own children: for they have guarded Your speeches, and preserved Your covenant.
\v 10 They shall teach Ya'aqov Your judgments, and Yisra'el Your Torah. They shall put incense before You, and whole ascension offering on Your altar.
\p
\v 11 "יהוה, bless his substance. Accept the work of his hands. Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him, of those who hate him, that they not rise again."
\p
\v 12 Of Benyamin he said, "The beloved of יהוה shall dwell securely by Him. He covers him all the day long. He dwells between His shoulders."
\p
\v 13 Of Yoseph he said, "His land is blessed by יהוה, for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep that stretches beneath,
\v 14 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious things of the growth of the moons,
\v 15 for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
\v 16 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness, the good will of Him who lived in the bush. Let the blessing come on the head of Yoseph, on the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.
\v 17 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild ox. With them he shall push the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth: they are the ten thousands of Ephrayim. They are the thousands of Menasheh."
\p
\v 18 Of Zevulun he said, "Rejoice, Zevulun, in your going out; and Yissakhar, in your tents.
\v 19 They shall call the peoples to the mountain. There they will slaughter sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand."
\p
\v 20 Of Gad he said, "He who enlarges Gad is blessed. He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head.
\v 21 He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's portion reserved. He came with the heads of the people. He executed the righteousness of יהוה, His judgments with Yisra'el."
\p
\v 22 Of Dan he said, "Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan."
\p
\v 23 Of Naphtali he said, "Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of the blessing of יהוה, possess the west and the south."
\p
\v 24 Of Asher he said, "Asher is blessed of children. Let him be acceptable to his brothers. Let him dip his foot in oil.
\p
\v 25 "Your bars shall be iron and copper. As your days, so your strength will be.
\p
\v 26 "There is none like El, Yeshurun, who rides on the heavens for your help, in His excellency on the skies.
\p
\v 27 "The Eternal Elohim is your dwelling place. Underneath are the everlasting arms. He thrust out the enemy from before you, and said, 'Destroy!'
\p
\v 28 "Yisra'el dwells securely; the fountain of Ya'aqov alone, in a land of grain and new wine. Yes, his heavens drop down dew.
\p
\v 29 "You are happy, Yisra'el. Who is like you, a people saved by יהוה, the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency! Your enemies shall submit themselves to you. You shall tread on their high places."
\c 34

\v 1 Mosheh went up from the plains of Moav to Mount Nevo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Yeriḥo. יהוה showed him all the land of Gilad, to Dan,
\v 2 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephrayim and Menasheh, and all the land of Yehudah, to the hinder sea,
\v 3 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Yeriḥo the city of palm trees, to Tsoar.
\v 4 יהוה said to him, "This is the land which I swore to Avraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya'aqov, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.' I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."
\v 5 So Mosheh the servant of יהוה died there in the land of Moav, according to the word of יהוה.
\v 6 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moav over against Beth Peor: but no man knows of his grave to this day.
\v 7 Mosheh was one hundred twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his freshness abated.
\v 8 The children of Yisra'el wept for Mosheh in the plains of Moav thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Mosheh were ended.
\p
\v 9 Yehoshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Mosheh had laid his hands on him: and the children of Yisra'el listened to him, and did as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\v 10 There has not since arisen a prophet in Yisra'el like Mosheh, whom יהוה knew face to face,
\v 11 in all the signs and the wonders, which יהוה sent him to do in the land of Mitsrayim, to Pharaoh, and to all His servants, and to all His land,
\v 12 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Mosheh worked in the sight of all Yisra'el.
