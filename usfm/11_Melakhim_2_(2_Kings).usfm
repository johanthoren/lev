\v 1 Moav rebelled against Yisra'el after the death of Aḥav.
\v 2 Aḥazyah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Shom'ron, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, "Go, inquire of Ba'al-Zevuv, the el of Eqron, whether I will recover of this sickness."
\v 3 But the messenger of יהוה said to Eliyah the Tishbite, "Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Shom'ron, and tell them, 'Is it because there is no Elohim in Yisra'el, that you go to inquire of Ba'al-Zevuv, the el of Eqron?
\v 4 Now therefore thus says יהוה, "You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die."'" Eliyah departed.
\p
\v 5 The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, "Why is it that you have returned?"
\v 6 They said to him, "A man came up to meet us, and said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, "Thus says יהוה, 'Is it because there is no Elohim in Yisra'el, that you send to inquire of Ba'al-Zevuv, the el of Eqron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.'"'"
\v 7 He said to them, "What judgment of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?"
\v 8 They answered him, "He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his loins." He said, "It is Eliyah the Tishbite."
\p
\v 9 Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, "Man of Elohim, the king has said, 'Come down!'"
\v 10 Eliyahu answered to the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of Elohim, let fire come down from the heavens, and consume you and your fifty!" Fire came down from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.
\p
\v 11 Again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. He answered him, "Man of Elohim, the king has said, 'Come down quickly!'"
\v 12 Eliyah answered them, "If I am a man of Elohim, let fire come down from the heavens, and consume you and your fifty!" The fire of Elohim came down from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.
\p
\v 13 Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Eliyahu, and begged him, and said to him, "Man of Elohim, please let my being, and the being of these fifty your servants, be precious in your eyes.
\v 14 Behold, fire came down from the heavens, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your eyes."
\p
\v 15 The messenger of יהוה said to Eliyahu, "Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him." He arose, and went down with him to the king.
\v 16 He said to him, "Thus says יהוה, 'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Ba'al-Zevuv, the el of Eqron, is it because there is no Elohim in Yisra'el to inquire of His word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.'"
\p
\v 17 So he died according to the word of יהוה which Eliyahu had spoken. Yehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Yehoram the son of Yehoshaphat king of Yehudah; because he had no son.
\v 18 Now the rest of the acts of Aḥazyahu which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el?
\c 2
\p
\v 1 And it came to be, when יהוה would take up Eliyahu by a whirlwind into the heavens, that Eliyahu went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\v 2 Eliyahu said to Elisha, "Please wait here, for יהוה has sent me as far as Beth-El." Elisha said, "As יהוה lives, and as your being lives, I will not leave you." So they went down to Beth-El.
\v 3 The sons of the prophets who were at Beth-El came out to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that יהוה will take away your master from your head today?" He said, "Yes, I know it; hold your peace."
\p
\v 4 Eliyahu said to him, "Elisha, please wait here, for יהוה has sent me to Yeriḥo." He said, "As יהוה lives, and as your being lives, I will not leave you." So they came to Yeriḥo.
\v 5 The sons of the prophets who were at Yeriḥo came near to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that יהוה will take away your master from your head today?" He answered, "Yes, I know it. Hold your peace."
\v 6 Eliyahu said to him, "Please wait here, for יהוה has sent me to the Yarden." He said, "As יהוה lives, and as your being lives, I will not leave you." They both went on.
\p
\v 7 Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Yarden.
\v 8 Eliyahu took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground.
\p
\v 9 And it came to be, when they had gone over, that Eliyahu said to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you." Elisha said, "Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me."
\v 10 He said, "You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so."
\p
\v 11 And it came to be, as they continued on and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and Eliyahu went up by a whirlwind into the heavens.
\v 12 Elisha saw it, and he cried, "My father, my father, the chariots of Yisra'el and its horsemen!" He saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.
\v 13 He took up also the mantle of Eliyahu that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Yarden.
\v 14 He took the mantle of Eliyahu that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, "Where is יהוה, the Elohim of Eliyahu?" When he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over.
\p
\v 15 When the sons of the prophets who were at Yeriḥo over against him saw him, they said, "The spirit of Eliyahu rests on Elisha." They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
\v 16 They said to him, "See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps the Ruaḥ of יהוה has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley. He said, "You shall not send them."
\v 17 When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, "Send them." They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched for three days, but did not find him.
\v 18 They came back to him, while he stayed at Yeriḥo; and he said to them, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not go'?"
\p
\v 19 The men of the city said to Elisha, "Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my master sees; but the water is bad, and the land miscarries."
\v 20 He said, "Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it." They brought it to him.
\v 21 He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, "Thus says יהוה, 'I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying.'"
\v 22 So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.
\p
\v 23 He went up from there to Beth-El. As he was going up by the way, some young men came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, "Go up, you bald head! Go up, you baldhead!"
\v 24 He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the Name of יהוה. Two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths.
\v 25 He went from there to Mount Karmel, and from there he returned to Shom'ron.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now Yehoram the son of Aḥav began to reign over Yisra'el in Shom'ron in the eighteenth year of Yehoshaphat king of Yehudah, and reigned twelve years.
\v 2 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Ba'al that his father had made.
\v 3 Nevertheless he held to the sins of Yarovam the son of Nevat, with which he made Yisra'el to sin; he did not depart from it.
\p
\v 4 Now Mesha king of Moav was a sheep breeder; and he rendered to the king of Yisra'el the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams.
\v 5 But it happened, when Aḥav was dead, that the king of Moav rebelled against the king of Yisra'el.
\v 6 King Yehoram went out of Shom'ron at that time, and mustered all Yisra'el.
\v 7 He went and sent to Yehoshaphat the king of Yehudah, saying, "The king of Moav has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moav to battle?" He said, "I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
\v 8 He said, "Which way shall we go up?" He answered, "The way of the wilderness of Edom."
\p
\v 9 So the king of Yisra'el went, and the king of Yehudah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey. There was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them.
\v 10 The king of Yisra'el said, "Alas! For יהוה has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moav."
\v 11 But Yehoshaphat said, "Is there not here a prophet of יהוה, that we may inquire of יהוה by him?" One of the king of Yisra'el's servants answered, "Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Eliyahu."
\v 12 Yehoshaphat said, "The word of יהוה is with him." So the king of Yisra'el and Yehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
\p
\v 13 Elisha said to the king of Yisra'el, "What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother." The king of Yisra'el said to him, "No; for יהוה has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moav."
\v 14 Elisha said, "As יהוה Tsevaot lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Yehoshaphat the king of Yehudah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.
\v 15 But now bring me a minstrel." It happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of יהוה came on him.
\v 16 He said, "Thus says יהוה, 'Make this wadi full of trenches.'
\v 17 For thus says יהוה, 'You will not see wind, neither will you see rain; yet that wadi shall be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your animals.
\v 18 This is but a light thing in the eyes of יהוה. He will also deliver the Moavites into your hand.
\v 19 You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.'"
\v 20 It happened in the morning, about the time of offering the offering, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
\p
\v 21 Now when all the Moavites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.
\v 22 They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moavites saw the water over against them as red as blood.
\v 23 They said, "This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moav, to the spoil!"
\v 24 When they came to the camp of Yisra'el, the Yisra'elites rose up and struck the Moavites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moavites.
\v 25 They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Qir Ḥareseth only they left its stones; however the men armed with slings went about it, and struck it.
\v 26 When the king of Moav saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.
\v 27 Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for an ascension offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Yisra'el: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.

\p
\v 1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, "Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared יהוה. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves."
\v 2 Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?" She said, "Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil."
\v 3 Then he said, "Go, borrow containers from of all your neighbors, even empty containers. Do not borrow just a few.
\v 4 You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those containers; and you shall set aside that which is full."
\v 5 So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought the containers to her, and she poured out.
\v 6 It happened, when the containers were full, that she said to her son, "Bring me another container." He said to her, "There is no other container." The oil stopped flowing.
\v 7 Then she came and told the man of Elohim. He said, "Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest."
\p
\v 8 It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.
\v 9 She said to her husband, "See now, I perceive that this is a set-apart man of Elohim, that passes by us continually.
\v 10 Please let us make a little room on the wall. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a menorah. It shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there."
\p
\v 11 One day he came there, and he turned into the room and lay there.
\v 12 He said to Geḥazi his servant, "Call this Shunammite." When he had called her, she stood before him.
\v 13 He said to him, "Say now to her, 'Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?'" She answered, "I dwell among my own people."
\v 14 He said, "What then is to be done for her?" Geḥazi answered, "Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old."
\v 15 He said, "Call her." When he had called her, she stood in the door.
\v 16 He said, "At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son." She said, "No, my master, you man of Elohim, do not lie to your handmaid."
\p
\v 17 The woman conceived, and brought forth a son at that appointed time, at the time of life, as Elisha had said to her.
\p
\v 18 When the child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers.
\v 19 He said to his father, "My head! My head!" He said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."
\v 20 When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.
\v 21 She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of Elohim, and shut the door after him, and went out.
\v 22 She called to her husband, and said, "Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of Elohim, and return again."
\v 23 He said, "Why would you want go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath." She said, "It is well."
\v 24 Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, "Drive, and go forward! Do not slow down for me, unless I ask you to."
\v 25 So she went, and came to the man of Elohim to Mount Karmel. It happened, when the man of Elohim saw her afar off, that he said to Geḥazi his servant, "Behold, there is the Shunammite.
\v 26 Please run now to meet her, and ask her, 'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?'" She answered, "It is well."
\v 27 When she came to the man of Elohim to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Geḥazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of Elohim said, "Leave her alone; for her being is bitter within her; and יהוה has hidden it from me, and has not told me."
\v 28 Then she said, "Did I desire a son of my master? Did I not say, 'Do not deceive me'?"
\p
\v 29 Then he said to Geḥazi, "Gird up your loins, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him again. Then lay my staff on the face of the child."
\v 30 The mother of the child said, "As יהוה lives, and as your being lives, I will not leave you." He arose, and followed her.
\v 31 Geḥazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, "The child has not awakened."
\p
\v 32 When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.
\v 33 And he went in and shut the door behind them both, and prayed to יהוה.
\v 34 He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew warm.
\v 35 Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
\v 36 He called Geḥazi, and said, "Call this Shunammite!" So he called her. When she had come in to him, he said, "Take up your son."
\v 37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.
\p
\v 38 Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, "Set on the great pot, and cook stew for the sons of the prophets."
\v 39 One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they did not recognize them.
\v 40 So they poured out for the men to eat. It happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out, and said, "Man of Elohim, there is death in the pot!" They could not eat of it.
\v 41 But he said, "Then bring meal." He cast it into the pot; and he said, "Pour out for the people, that they may eat." There was no harm in the pot.
\p
\v 42 A man from Ba'al Shalishah came, and brought the man of Elohim bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, "Give to the people, that they may eat."
\v 43 His servant said, "What, should I set this before a hundred men?" But he said, "Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says יהוה, 'They will eat, and will have some left over.'"
\v 44 So he set it before them, and they ate, and left some of it, according to the word of יהוה.

\p
\v 1 Now Na'aman, captain of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him יהוה had given victory to Aram: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
\v 2 The Arameans had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Yisra'el a little maiden; and she waited on Na'aman's wife.
\v 3 She said to her mistress, "Oh that my master were with the prophet who is in Shom'ron! Then he would heal him of his leprosy."
\v 4 Someone went in, and told his master, saying, "The maiden who is from the land of Yisra'el said this."
\v 5 The king of Aram said, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Yisra'el." He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.
\p
\v 6 He brought the letter to the king of Yisra'el, saying, "Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Na'aman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy."
\v 7 It happened, when the king of Yisra'el had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, "Am I Elohim, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me."
\p
\v 8 It was so, when Elisha the man of Elohim heard that the king of Yisra'el had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Yisra'el."
\v 9 So Na'aman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
\v 10 Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Yarden seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean."
\v 11 But Na'aman was angry, and went away, and said, "Behold, I thought, 'He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the Name of יהוה his Elohim, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.'
\v 12 Are not Avanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Dammeseq, better than all the waters of Yisra'el? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.
\v 13 His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, "My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, 'Wash, and be clean?'"
\v 14 Then he went down, and dipped himself seven times in the Yarden, according to the saying of the man of Elohim; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
\p
\v 15 He returned to the man of Elohim, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, "See now, I know that there is no elohim in all the earth, but in Yisra'el. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant."
\v 16 But he said, "As יהוה lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none." He urged him to take it; but he refused.
\v 17 Na'aman said, "If not, then, please let there be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth; for your servant will from now on offer neither ascension offering nor sacrifice to other elohim, but to יהוה.
\v 18 In this thing may יהוה pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may יהוה pardon your servant in this thing."
\v 19 He said to him, "Go in peace." So he departed from him a little way.
\p
\v 20 But Geḥazi the servant of Elisha the man of Elohim, said, "Behold, my master has spared this Na'aman the Aramean, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As יהוה lives, I will run after him, and take something from him."
\v 21 So Geḥazi followed after Na'aman. When Na'aman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, "Is all well?"
\v 22 He said, "All is well. My master has sent me, saying, 'Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephrayim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.'"
\v 23 Na'aman said, "Be pleased to take two talents." He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him.
\v 24 When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed.
\v 25 But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, "Where did you come from, Geḥazi?" He said, "Your servant went nowhere."
\p
\v 26 He said to him, "Did not my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?
\v 27 Therefore the leprosy of Na'aman will cling to you and to your seed forever." He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "See now, the place where we dwell before you is too small for us.
\v 2 Please let us go to the Yarden, and every man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell." He answered, "Go!"
\v 3 One said, "Please be pleased to go with your servants." He answered, "I will go."
\v 4 So he went with them. When they came to the Yarden, they cut down wood.
\v 5 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, "Alas, my master! For it was borrowed."
\v 6 The man of Elohim asked, "Where did it fall?" He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float.
\v 7 He said, "Take it." So he put out his hand and took it.
\p
\v 8 Now the king of Aram was warring against Yisra'el; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, "My camp will be in such and such a place."
\v 9 The man of Elohim sent to the king of Yisra'el, saying, "Be on guard that you not pass such a place; for the Arameans are coming down there."
\v 10 The king of Yisra'el sent to the place which the man of Elohim told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.
\p
\v 11 The heart of the king of Aram was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, "Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Yisra'el?"
\v 12 One of his servants said, "No, my master, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Yisra'el, tells the king of Yisra'el the words that you speak in your bedroom."
\v 13 He said, "Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him." It was told him, saying, "Behold, he is in Dothan."
\v 14 Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night, and surrounded the city.
\p
\v 15 When the servant of the man of Elohim had risen early, and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to him, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?"
\v 16 He answered, "Do not be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them."
\v 17 Elisha prayed, and said, "יהוה, please open his eyes, that he may see." יהוה opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha.
\v 18 When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to יהוה, and said, "Please strike this people with blindness." He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
\v 19 Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." He led them to Shom'ron.
\p
\v 20 It happened, when they were come into Shom'ron, that Elisha said, "יהוה, open the eyes of these men, that they may see." יהוה opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Shom'ron.
\v 21 The king of Yisra'el said to Elisha, when he saw them, "My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?"
\v 22 He answered, "You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master."
\v 23 He prepared great feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. The bands of Aram stopped raiding the land of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 24 It happened after this, that Ben Hadad king of Aram gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Shom'ron.
\v 25 There was a great famine in Shom'ron. Behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a qab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
\v 26 As the king of Yisra'el was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, "Help, my master, O king!"
\v 27 He said, "If יהוה does not help you, from where could I help you? From of the threshing floor, or from the winepress?"
\v 28 The king said to her, "What ails you?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'
\v 29 So we cooked my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, 'Give your son, that we may eat him;' and she has hidden her son."
\v 30 It happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes (now he was passing by on the wall); and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh.
\v 31 Then he said, "Elohim do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stay on him this day."
\p
\v 32 But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, "Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
\v 33 While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, "Behold, this evil is from יהוה. Why should I wait for יהוה any longer?"
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Elisha said, "Hear the word of יהוה. Thus says יהוה, 'Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a sheqel, and two measures of barley for a sheqel, in the gate of Shom'ron.'"
\v 2 Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of Elohim, and said, "Behold, if יהוה made windows in heavens, could this thing be?" He said, "Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it."
\p
\v 3 Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said one to another, "Why do we sit here until we die?
\v 4 If we say, 'We will enter into the city,' then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army of the Arameans. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die."
\v 5 They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Arameans. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no man there.
\v 6 For יהוה had made the army of the Arameans to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, "Behold, the king of Yisra'el has hired against us the kings of the Ḥittites, and the kings of the Mitsrites, to come on us."
\v 7 Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their being.
\v 8 When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it.
\p
\v 9 Then they said one to another, "We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, iniquity will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household."
\v 10 So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, "We came to the camp of the Arameans, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were."
\v 11 He called the porters; and they told it to the king's household within.
\v 12 The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, "I will now show you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.'"
\v 13 One of his servants answered, "Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Yisra'el who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Yisra'el who are consumed. Let us send and see."
\v 14 They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the army of the Arameans, saying, "Go and see."
\p
\v 15 They went after them to the Yarden; and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Arameans had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king.
\p
\v 16 The people went out, and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a sheqel, and two measures of barley for a sheqel, according to the word of יהוה.
\v 17 The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on him in the gate, and he died as the man of Elohim had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
\v 18 It happened, as the man of Elohim had spoken to the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a sheqel, and a measure of fine flour for a sheqel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Shom'ron;"
\v 19 and that captain answered the man of Elohim, and said, "Now, behold, if יהוה should make windows in heavens, might such a thing be?" and he said, "Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it."
\v 20 It happened like that to him; for the people trod on him in the gate, and he died.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Now Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, "Arise, and go, you and your household, and stay for a while wherever you can; for יהוה has called for a famine. It shall also come on the land seven years."
\v 2 The woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of Elohim. She went with her household, and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\v 3 It happened at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines. Then she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.
\v 4 Now the king was talking with Geḥazi the servant of the man of Elohim, saying, "Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done."
\v 5 It happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, that behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. Geḥazi said, "My master, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life."
\v 6 When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, "Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now."
\p
\v 7 Elisha came to Dammeseq; and Ben Hadad the king of Aram was sick. It was told him, saying, "The man of Elohim has come here."
\v 8 The king said to Ḥaza'el, "Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of Elohim, and inquire of יהוה by him, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
\v 9 So Ḥaza'el went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Dammeseq, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, "Your son Ben Hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
\v 10 Elisha said to him, "Go, tell him, 'You shall surely recover;' however יהוה has shown me that he shall surely die."
\v 11 He settled his gaze steadfastly on him, until he was ashamed. Then the man of Elohim wept.
\v 12 Ḥaza'el said, "Why do you weep, my master?" He answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Yisra'el. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child."
\v 13 Ḥaza'el said, "But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Elisha answered, "יהוה has shown me that you will be king over Aram."
\v 14 Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" He answered, "He told me that you would surely recover."
\v 15 It happened on the next day, that he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died. Then Ḥaza'el reigned in his place.
\p
\v 16 In the fifth year of Yoram the son of Aḥav king of Yisra'el, Yehoshaphat being king of Yehudah then, Yehoram the son of Yehoshaphat king of Yehudah began to reign.
\v 17 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned eight years in Yerushalayim.
\v 18 He walked in the way of the kings of Yisra'el, as did the house of Aḥav; for he had the daughter of Aḥav as wife. He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה.
\v 19 However יהוה would not destroy Yehudah, for David his servant's sake, as He promised him to give to him a lamp for his children always.
\p
\v 20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Yehudah, and made a king over themselves.
\v 21 Then Yoram passed over to Tsair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.
\v 22 So Edom revolted from under the hand of Yehudah to this day. Then did Livnah revolt at the same time.
\v 23 The rest of the acts of Yoram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\p
\v 24 Yoram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Aḥazyahu his son reigned in his place.
\p
\v 25 In the twelfth year of Yoram the son of Aḥav king of Yisra'el did Aḥazyahu the son of Yehoram king of Yehudah begin to reign.
\v 26 Twenty-two years old was Aḥazyahu when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was Athalyahu the daughter of Omri king of Yisra'el.
\v 27 He walked in the way of the house of Aḥav, and did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, as did the house of Aḥav; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Aḥav.
\p
\v 28 He went with Yoram the son of Aḥav to war against Ḥaza'el king of Aram at Ramoth Gilad: and the Arameans wounded Yoram.
\v 29 King Yoram returned to be healed in Yizre'el of the wounds which the Arameans had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Ḥaza'el king of Aram. Aḥazyahu the son of Yehoram king of Yehudah went down to see Yoram the son of Aḥav in Yizre'el, because he was sick.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, "Gird up your loins, take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilad.
\v 2 When you come there, find Yehu the son of Yehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner room.
\v 3 Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, 'Thus says יהוה, "I have anointed you king over Yisra'el."' Then open the door, flee, and do not wait."
\p
\v 4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilad.
\v 5 When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. Then he said, "I have a message for you, captain." Yehu said, "To which of us all?" He said, "To you, O captain."
\v 6 He arose, and went into the house. Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'I have anointed you king over the people of יהוה, even over Yisra'el.
\v 7 You shall strike the house of Aḥav your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of יהוה, at the hand of Izevel.
\v 8 For the whole house of Aḥav shall perish. I will cut off from Aḥav everyone who urinates against a wall, both him who is closed up and him who is left at large in Yisra'el.
\v 9 I will make the house of Aḥav like the house of Yarovam the son of Nevat, and like the house of Ba'asha the son of Aḥiyah.
\v 10 The dogs will eat Izevel on the plot of ground of Yizre'el, and there shall be none to bury her.'" He opened the door, and fled.
\p
\v 11 Then Yehu came forth to the servants of his master: and one said to him, "Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?" He said to them, "You know the man and what his complaint was."
\v 12 They said, "False. Tell us now." He said, "He said to me, 'Thus says יהוה, I have anointed you king over Yisra'el.'"
\v 13 Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the shofar, saying, "Yehu is king."
\p
\v 14 So Yehu the son of Yehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Yoram. (Now Yoram was guarding Ramoth Gilad, he and all Yisra'el, because of Ḥaza'el king of Aram;
\v 15 but King Yoram was returned to be healed in Yizre'el of the wounds which the Arameans had given him, when he fought with Ḥaza'el king of Aram.) Yehu said, "If this is the desire of your being, then let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to tell it in Yizre'el."
\v 16 So Yehu rode in a chariot, and went to Yizre'el; for Yoram lay there. Aḥazyah king of Yehudah had come down to see Yoram.
\p
\v 17 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Yizre'el, and he spied the company of Yehu as he came, and said, "I see a company." Yoram said, "Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, 'Is it peace?'"
\v 18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" Yehu said, "What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!" The watchman said, "The messenger came to them, but he is not coming back."
\v 19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" Yehu answered, "What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!"
\v 20 The watchman said, "He came to them, and is not coming back. The driving is like the driving of Yehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously."
\p
\v 21 Yoram said, "Get ready!" They got his chariot ready. Yoram king of Yisra'el and Aḥazyahu king of Yehudah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Yehu, and found him in the portion of Navoth the Yizre'elite.
\v 22 It happened, when Yoram saw Yehu, that he said, "Is it peace, Yehu?" He answered, "What peace, so long as the whorings of your mother Izevel and her sorceries are many?"
\v 23 Yoram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Aḥazyahu, "There is treason, Aḥazyah!"
\v 24 Yehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Yoram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
\v 25 Then Yehu said to Bidqar his captain, "Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Navoth the Yizre'elite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Aḥav his father, יהוה laid this burden on him:
\v 26 'Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Navoth, and the blood of his sons,' says יהוה; 'and I will repay you in this plot of ground,' says יהוה. Now therefore take and cast him onto the plot of ground, according to the word of יהוה."
\p
\v 27 But when Aḥazyah the king of Yehudah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Yehu followed after him, and said, "Strike him also in the chariot!" They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Yivleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there.
\v 28 His servants carried him in a chariot to Yerushalayim, and buried him in his grave with his fathers in the city of David.
\p
\v 29 In the eleventh year of Yoram the son of Aḥav began Aḥazyah to reign over Yehudah.
\p
\v 30 When Yehu was come to Yizre'el, Izevel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.
\v 31 As Yehu entered in at the gate, she said, "Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?"
\v 32 He lifted up his face to the window, and said, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
\p
\v 33 He said, "Throw her down!" So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot.
\v 34 When he was come in, he ate and drink; and he said, "See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter."
\v 35 They went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
\v 36 Therefore they came back, and told him. He said, "This is the word of יהוה, which He spoke by his servant Eliyahu the Tishbite, saying, 'The dogs will eat the flesh of Izevel on the plot of Yizre'el,
\v 37 and the body of Izevel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Yizre'el, so that they shall not say, "This is Izevel."'"
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now Aḥav had seventy sons in Shom'ron. Yehu wrote letters, and sent to Shom'ron, to the rulers of Yizre'el, even the elders, and to those who affirmed the sons of Aḥav, saying,
\v 2 "Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor.
\v 3 Select the best and fittest of your master's sons, set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house."
\v 4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, "Behold, the two kings did not stand before him! How then shall we stand?"
\v 5 He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who affirmed the children, sent to Yehu, saying, "We are your servants, and will do all that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your eyes."
\v 6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, "If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Yizre'el by tomorrow this time." Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.
\v 7 It happened, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and killed them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Yizre'el.
\v 8 A messenger came, and told him, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." He said, "Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning."
\v 9 It happened in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, "You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him; but who struck all these?
\v 10 Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of יהוה, which יהוה spoke concerning the house of Aḥav. For יהוה has done that which He spoke by His servant Eliyahu."
\v 11 So Yehu struck all that remained of the house of Aḥav in Yizre'el, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
\p
\v 12 He arose and departed, and went to Shom'ron. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way,
\v 13 Yehu met with the brothers of Aḥazyahu king of Yehudah, and said, "Who are you?" They answered, "We are the brothers of Aḥazyahu. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen."
\v 14 He said, "Take them alive!" They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men. He did not leave any of them.
\p
\v 15 When he had departed from there, he met Yehonadav the son of Rekhav coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, "Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?" Yehonadav answered, "It is." "If it is, give me your hand." He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
\v 16 He said, "Come with me, and see my zeal for יהוה." So they made him ride in his chariot.
\v 17 When he came to Shom'ron, he struck all who remained to Aḥav in Shom'ron, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of יהוה, which He spoke to Eliyahu.
\p
\v 18 Yehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, "Aḥav served Ba'al a little; but Yehu will serve him much.
\v 19 Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Ba'al, all of his servants, and all of his priests. Let none be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to Ba'al. Whoever is absent, he shall not live." But Yehu did it in subtlety, intending that he might destroy the servants of Ba'al.
\v 20 Yehu said, "Set apart a solemn assembly for Ba'al!" They proclaimed it.
\v 21 Yehu sent through all Yisra'el; and all the servants of Ba'al came, so that there was not a man left that did not come. They came into the house of Ba'al; and the house of Ba'al was filled from one end to another.
\v 22 He said to him who was over the wardrobe, "Bring out robes for all the servants of Ba'al!" He brought robes out to them.
\v 23 Yehu went with Yehonadav the son of Rekhav into the house of Ba'al. Then he said to the servants of Ba'al, "Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of יהוה, but the servants of Ba'al only."
\v 24 They went in to offer sacrifices and ascension offerings. Now Yehu had appointed him eighty men outside, and said, "If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go shall give his being for the being of him who escaped."
\p
\v 25 And it came about, as soon as he finished offering the ascension offering, that Yehu said to the guard and to the captains, "Go in, and kill them! Let none escape." They struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Ba'al.
\v 26 They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Ba'al, and burned them.
\v 27 They broke down the pillar of Ba'al, and broke down the house of Ba'al, and made it a latrine, to this day.
\p
\v 28 Thus Yehu destroyed Ba'al out of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 29 However from the sins of Yarovam the son of Nevat, with which he made Yisra'el to sin, Yehu did not depart from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Beth-El, and that were in Dan.
\v 30 יהוה said to Yehu, "Because you have done well in executing that which is right in My eyes, and have done to the house of Aḥav according to all that was in My heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Yisra'el."
\v 31 But Yehu did not guard to walk in the Torah of יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, with all his heart. He did not depart from the sins of Yarovam, with which he made Yisra'el to sin.
\p
\v 32 In those days יהוה began to cut off from Yisra'el; and Ḥaza'el struck them in all the borders of Yisra'el;
\v 33 from the Yarden eastward, all the land of Gilad, the Gadites, and the Reuvenites, and the Menashites, from Aroer, which is by the wadi of Arnon, even Gilad and Bashan.
\p
\v 34 Now the rest of the acts of Yehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el?
\v 35 Yehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Shom'ron. Yehoaḥaz his son reigned in his place.
\v 36 The time that Yehu reigned over Yisra'el in Shom'ron was twenty-eight years.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now when Athalyah the mother of Aḥazyahu saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed.
\v 2 But Yehosheva, the daughter of King Yoram, sister of Aḥazyahu, took Yoash the son of Aḥazyah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athalyahu, so that he was not slain.
\v 3 And He was with her hidden in the House of יהוה for six years. Athalyah reigned over the land.
\p
\v 4 In the seventh year Yehoyada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Karites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of יהוה; and he cut a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of יהוה, and showed them the king's son.
\v 5 He commanded them, saying, "This is the thing that you shall do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
\v 6 A third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard. So you shall guard the watch of the house, and be a barrier.
\v 7 The two companies of you, even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of יהוה around the king.
\v 8 You shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in."
\p
\v 9 The captains over hundreds did according to all that Yehoyada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Yehoyada the priest.
\v 10 The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of יהוה.
\v 11 The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king.
\v 12 Then he brought out the king's son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the witness; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, "Let the king live!"
\p
\v 13 When Athalyah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the house of יהוה:
\v 14 and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, according to the judgment, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athalyah tore her clothes, and cried, "Treason! Treason!"
\v 15 Yehoyada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks. Kill him who follows her with the sword." For the priest said, "Do not let her be slain in the house of יהוה."
\v 16 So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses' entry to the king's house. She was slain there.
\p
\v 17 Yehoyada cut a covenant between יהוה and the king and the people, that they should be the people of יהוה; between the king also and the people.
\v 18 All the people of the land went to the house of Ba'al, and broke it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Ba'al before the altars. The priest appointed officers over the house of יהוה.
\v 19 He took the captains over hundreds, and the Karites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of יהוה, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. He sat on the throne of the kings.
\v 20 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athalyahu they had slain with the sword at the king's house.
\p
\v 21 Yehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 In the seventh year of Yehu began Yehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Tsivyah of Beersheva.
\v 2 Yehoash did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה all his days in which Yehoyada the priest instructed him.
\v 3 However the high places were not taken away; the people still slaughtered and burned incense in the high places.
\p
\v 4 Yehoash said to the priests, "All the money of the set-apart things that is brought into the house of יהוה, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it comes into any man's heart to bring into the House of יהוה,
\v 5 let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found."
\p
\v 6 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of King Yehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
\v 7 Then King Yehoash called for Yehoyada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, "Why do you not repair the breaches of the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for the breaches of the house."
\v 8 The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.
\p
\v 9 But Yehoyada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of יהוה: and the priests who guarded the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of יהוה.
\v 10 It was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of יהוה.
\v 11 They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of יהוה: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on the house of יהוה,
\v 12 and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of יהוה, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
\v 13 But there were not made for the house of יהוה cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of יהוה;
\v 14 for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired therewith the house of יהוה.
\v 15 Moreover they did not demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt in unfaithfulness.
\v 16 The money for the guilt offerings, and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought into the house of יהוה: it was the priests'.
\p
\v 17 Then Ḥaza'el king of Aram went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Ḥaza'el set his face to go up to Yerushalayim.
\v 18 Yehoash king of Yehudah took all the set-apart things that Yehoshaphat and Yehoram and Aḥazyahu, his fathers, kings of Yehudah, had dedicated, and his own set-apart things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of יהוה, and of the king's house, and sent it to Ḥaza'el king of Aram: and he went away from Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 19 Now the rest of the acts of Yoash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\v 20 His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Yoash at the house of Millo, [on the way] that goes down to Silla.
\v 21 For Yozavad the son of Shimeath, and Yehozavad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amatsyah his son reigned in his place.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 In the three and twentieth year of Yoash the son of Aḥazyahu, king of Yehudah, Yehoaḥaz the son of Yehu began to reign over Yisra'el in Shom'ron, and he reigned seventeen years.
\v 2 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, and followed the sins of Yarovam the son of Nevat, with which he made Yisra'el to sin; he did not depart from it.
\v 3 The anger of יהוה was kindled against Yisra'el, and He delivered them into the hand of Ḥaza'el king of Aram, and into the hand of Ben Hadad the son of Ḥaza'el, continually.
\v 4 Yehoaḥaz begged יהוה, and יהוה listened to him; for He saw the oppression of Yisra'el, how that the king of Aram oppressed them.
\v 5 (יהוה gave Yisra'el a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Arameans; and the children of Yisra'el lived in their tents as before.
\v 6 Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Yarovam, with which he made Yisra'el to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Shom'ron.)
\v 7 For He did not leave to Yehoaḥaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Aram destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.
\v 8 Now the rest of the acts of Yehoaḥaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el?
\v 9 Yehoaḥaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Shom'ron: and Yoash his son reigned in his place.
\p
\v 10 In the thirty-seventh year of Yoash king of Yehudah began Yehoash the son of Yehoaḥaz to reign over Yisra'el in Shom'ron, and he reigned sixteen years.
\v 11 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה; he did not depart from all the sins of Yarovam the son of Nevat, with which he made Yisra'el to sin; but he walked therein.
\v 12 Now the rest of the acts of Yoash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amatsyah king of Yehudah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el?
\v 13 Yoash slept with his fathers; and Yarovam sat on his throne: and Yoash was buried in Shom'ron with the kings of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died: and Yoash the king of Yisra'el came down to him, and wept over him, and said, "My father, my father, the chariots of Yisra'el and its horsemen!"
\v 15 Elisha said to him, "Take bow and arrows;" and he took to him bow and arrows.
\v 16 He said to the king of Yisra'el, "Put your hand on the bow;" and he put his hand on it. Elisha laid his hands on the king's hands.
\v 17 He said, "Open the window eastward;" and he opened it. Then Elisha said, "Shoot!" and he shot. He said, "The arrow of the victory of יהוה, even the arrow of victory over Aram; for you shall strike the Arameans in Apheq, until you have consumed them."
\v 18 He said, "Take the arrows;" and he took them. He said to the king of Yisra'el, "Strike the ground;" and he struck three times, and stopped.
\v 19 The man of Elohim was angry with him, and said, "You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Aram until you had consumed it, whereas now you shall strike Aram just three times."
\p
\v 20 Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moavites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
\v 21 It happened, as they were burying a man, that behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
\p
\v 22 Ḥaza'el king of Aram oppressed Yisra'el all the days of Yehoaḥaz.
\v 23 But יהוה was favorable to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of His covenant with Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya'aqov, and would not destroy them, neither did He cast them from His presence as yet.
\p
\v 24 Ḥaza'el king of Aram died; and Ben Hadad his son reigned in his place.
\v 25 Yehoash the son of Yehoaḥaz took again out of the hand of Ben Hadad the son of Ḥaza'el the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Yehoaḥaz his father by war. Three times did Yoash strike him, and recovered the cities of Yisra'el.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 In the second year of Yoash son of Yoaḥaz king of Yisra'el began Amatsyahu the son of Yoash king of Yehudah to reign.
\v 2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Yehoaddin of Yerushalayim.
\v 3 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, yet not like David his father: he did according to all that Yoash his father had done.
\v 4 However the high places were not taken away: the people still slaughtered and burned incense in the high places.
\v 5 It happened, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father:
\v 6 but the children of the murderers he did not put to death; according to that which is written in the book of the Torah of Mosheh, as יהוה commanded, saying, "The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin."
\p
\v 7 He killed of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called its name Yoqthe'el, to this day.
\p
\v 8 Then Amatsyah sent messengers to Yehoash, the son of Yehoaḥaz son of Yehu, king of Yisra'el, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."
\v 9 Yehoash the king of Yisra'el sent to Amatsyahu king of Yehudah, saying, "The thistle that was in Levanon sent to the cedar that was in Levanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as wife. Then a wild animal that was in Levanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle.
\v 10 You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your harm, that you should fall, even you, and Yehudah with you?'"
\p
\v 11 But Amatsyahu would not listen. So Yehoash king of Yisra'el went up; and he and Amatsyahu king of Yehudah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Yehudah.
\v 12 Yehudah was defeated by Yisra'el; and they fled every man to his tent.
\v 13 Yehoash king of Yisra'el took Amatsyahu king of Yehudah, the son of Yehoash the son of Aḥazyahu, at Beth Shemesh, and came to Yerushalayim, and broke down the wall of Yerushalayim from the gate of Ephrayim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\v 14 He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of יהוה, and in the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Shom'ron.
\p
\v 15 Now the rest of the acts of Yehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amatsyahu king of Yehudah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el?
\v 16 Yehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Shom'ron with the kings of Yisra'el; and Yarovam his son reigned in his place.
\p
\v 17 Amatsyahu the son of Yoash king of Yehudah lived after the death of Yehoash son of Yehoaḥaz king of Yisra'el fifteen years.
\v 18 Now the rest of the acts of Amatsyahu, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\v 19 They made a conspiracy against him in Yerushalayim; and he fled to Lakish: but they sent after him to Lakish, and killed him there.
\v 20 They brought him on horses; and he was buried at Yerushalayim with his fathers in the city of David.
\v 21 All the people of Yehudah took Azaryah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amatsyahu.
\v 22 He built Elath, and restored it to Yehudah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
\p
\v 23 In the fifteenth year of Amatsyahu the son of Yoash king of Yehudah, Yarovam the son of Yoash king of Yisra'el began to reign in Shom'ron, and he reigned forty-one years.
\v 24 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה: he did not depart from all the sins of Yarovam the son of Nevat, with which he made Yisra'el to sin.
\v 25 He restored the border of Yisra'el from the entrance of Ḥamath to the sea of the Aravah, according to the word of יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, which He spoke by His servant Yonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath Ḥepher.
\v 26 For יהוה saw the affliction of Yisra'el, that it was very bitter; for there was none closed up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Yisra'el.
\v 27 יהוה did not say that He would blot out the name of Yisra'el from under the heavens; but He saved them by the hand of Yarovam the son of Yoash.
\p
\v 28 Now the rest of the acts of Yarovam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Dammeseq, and Ḥamath, which had belonged to Yehudah, for Yisra'el, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el?
\v 29 Yarovam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Yisra'el; and Zekharyah his son reigned in his place.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 In the twenty-seventh year of Yarovam king of Yisra'el began Azaryah son of Amatsyah king of Yehudah to reign.
\v 2 He was sixteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Yekolyahu of Yerushalayim.
\v 3 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, according to all that his father Amatsyahu had done.
\v 4 However the high places were not taken away: the people still slaughtered and burned incense in the high places.
\v 5 יהוה struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house. Yotham the king's son was over the household, judging the people of the land.
\v 6 Now the rest of the acts of Azaryah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\v 7 Azaryah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Yotham his son reigned in his place.
\p
\v 8 In the thirty-eighth year of Azaryahu king of Yehudah did Zekharyahu the son of Yarovam reign over Yisra'el in Shom'ron six months.
\v 9 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, as his fathers had done: he did not depart from the sins of Yarovam the son of Nevat, with which he made Yisra'el to sin.
\v 10 Shallum the son of Yavesh conspired against him, and struck him before the people, and killed him, and reigned in his place.
\v 11 Now the rest of the acts of Zekharyah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el.
\v 12 This was the word of יהוה which he spoke to Yehu, saying, "Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Yisra'el." So it came about.
\p
\v 13 Shallum the son of Yavesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziyah king of Yehudah; and he reigned for a month in Shom'ron.
\v 14 Menaḥem the son of Gadi went up from Tirtsah, and came to Shom'ron, and struck Shallum the son of Yavesh in Shom'ron, and killed him, and reigned in his place.
\v 15 Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el.
\v 16 Then Menaḥem struck Tiphsah, and all who were therein, and its borders, from Tirtsah: because they did not open to him, therefore he struck it; and all the women therein who were with child he split open.
\p
\v 17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azaryah king of Yehudah began Menaḥem the son of Gadi to reign over Yisra'el, [and reigned] ten years in Shom'ron.
\v 18 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה: he did not depart all his days from the sins of Yarovam the son of Nevat, with which he made Yisra'el to sin.
\p
\v 19 There came against the land Pul the king of Ashuwr; and Menaḥem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
\v 20 Menaḥem exacted the money of Yisra'el, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty sheqels of silver, to give to the king of Ashuwr. So the king of Ashuwr turned back, and did not stay there in the land.
\v 21 Now the rest of the acts of Menaḥem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el?
\v 22 Menaḥem slept with his fathers; and Peqaḥyah his son reigned in his place.
\p
\v 23 In the fiftieth year of Azaryah king of Yehudah Peqaḥyah the son of Menaḥem began to reign over Yisra'el in Shom'ron, and he reigned two years.
\v 24 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה: he did not depart from the sins of Yarovam the son of Nevat, with which he made Yisra'el to sin.
\v 25 Peqaḥ the son of Remalyahu, his captain, conspired against him, and struck him in Shom'ron, in the castle of the king's house, with Argov and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Giladites: and he killed him, and reigned in his place.
\v 26 Now the rest of the acts of Peqaḥyah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azaryah king of Yehudah Peqaḥ the son of Remalyahu began to reign over Yisra'el in Shom'ron, and he reigned twenty years.
\v 28 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה: he did not depart from the sins of Yarovam the son of Nevat, with which he made Yisra'el to sin.
\p
\v 29 In the days of Peqaḥ king of Yisra'el came Tiglath Pileser king of Ashuwr, and took Iyon, and Aveil Beth Ma'akah, and Yanoaḥ, and Qedesh, and Ḥatsor, and Gilad, and the Galil, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Ashuwr.
\v 30 Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Peqaḥ the son of Remalyah, and struck him, and killed him, and reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Yotham the son of Uzziyah.
\v 31 Now the rest of the acts of Peqaḥ, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 32 In the second year of Peqaḥ the son of Remalyahu king of Yisra'el began Yotham the son of Uzziyahu king of Yehudah to reign.
\v 33 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Yerusha the daughter of Tsadoq.
\v 34 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה; he did according to all that his father Uzziyahu had done.
\v 35 However the high places were not taken away: the people still slaughtered and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of יהוה.
\v 36 Now the rest of the acts of Yotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\p
\v 37 In those days יהוה began to send against Yehudah Retsin the king of Aram, and Peqaḥ the son of Remalyahu.
\p
\v 38 Yotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Aḥaz his son reigned in his place.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 In the seventeenth year of Peqaḥ the son of Remalyahu Aḥaz the son of Yotham king of Yehudah began to reign.
\v 2 Twenty years old was Aḥaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim: and he did not do that which was right in the eyes of יהוה his Elohim, like David his father.
\v 3 But he walked in the way of the kings of Yisra'el, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom יהוה cast out from before the children of Yisra'el.
\v 4 He slaughtered and burned incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\p
\v 5 Then Retsin king of Aram and Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu king of Yisra'el came up to Yerushalayim to war: and they besieged Aḥaz, but could not overcome him.
\v 6 At that time Retsin king of Aram recovered Elath to Aram, and drove the Yehudim from Elath; and the Arameans came to Elath, and lived there, to this day.
\p
\v 7 So Aḥaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Ashuwr, saying, "I am your servant and your son. Come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram, and out of the hand of the king of Yisra'el, who rise up against me."
\v 8 Aḥaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of יהוה, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Ashuwr.
\v 9 The king of Ashuwr listened to him; and the king of Ashuwr went up against Dammeseq, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Qir, and killed Retsin.
\v 10 King Aḥaz went to Dammeseq to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Ashuwr, and saw the altar that was at Dammeseq; and King Aḥaz sent to Uriyah the priest the likeness of the altar, and its pattern, according to all its workmanship.
\v 11 Uriyah the priest built an altar: according to all that King Aḥaz had sent from Dammeseq, so did Uriyah the priest make it against the coming of King Aḥaz from Dammeseq.
\v 12 When the king was come from Dammeseq, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near to the altar, and offered thereon.
\v 13 He burned his ascension offering and his meal offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, on the altar.
\v 14 The copper altar, which was before יהוה, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of יהוה, and put it on the north side of his altar.
\v 15 King Aḥaz commanded Uriyah the priest, saying, "On the great altar burn the morning ascension offering, and the evening meal offering, and the king's ascension offering, and his meal offering, with the ascension offering of all the people of the land, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the ascension offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the copper altar shall be for me to inquire by."
\v 16 Uriyah the priest did so, according to all that King Aḥaz commanded.
\p
\v 17 King Aḥaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from off the copper oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone.
\v 18 The portico for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry outside, turned he to the house of יהוה, because of the king of Ashuwr.
\v 19 Now the rest of the acts of Aḥaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\v 20 Aḥaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ḥizqiyahu his son reigned in his place.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 In the twelfth year of Aḥaz king of Yehudah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Shom'ron over Yisra'el, and he reigned nine years.
\v 2 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, yet not as the kings of Yisra'el who were before him.
\v 3 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Ashuwr; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.
\v 4 The king of Ashuwr found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Mitsrayim, and offered no tribute to the king of Ashuwr, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Ashuwr shut him up, and bound him in prison.
\p
\v 5 Then the king of Ashuwr came up throughout all the land, and went up to Shom'ron, and besieged it three years.
\p
\v 6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Ashuwr took Shom'ron, and carried Yisra'el away to Ashuwr, and placed them in Ḥalah, and on the Ḥavor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\p
\v 7 It was so, because the children of Yisra'el had sinned against יהוה their Elohim, who brought them up out of the land of Mitsrayim from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim, and had feared other elohim,
\v 8 and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom יהוה cast out from before the children of Yisra'el, and of the kings of Yisra'el, which they made.
\v 9 The children of Yisra'el did secretly things that were not right against יהוה their Elohim: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;
\v 10 and they set them up pillars and Asherim on every high hill, and under every green tree;
\v 11 and there they burned incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom יהוה carried away before them; and they worked wicked things to provoke יהוה to anger;
\v 12 and they served idols, of which יהוה had said to them, "You shall not do this thing."
\v 13 Yet יהוה testified to Yisra'el, and to Yehudah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, "Turn from your evil ways, and guard My commands and My statutes, according to all the Torah which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets."
\v 14 Notwithstanding, they would not listen, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who did not trust יהוה their Elohim.
\v 15 They rejected His statutes, and His covenant that He cut with their fathers, and His witnesses which He testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the nations that were around them, concerning whom יהוה had commanded them that they should not do like them.
\v 16 They forsook all the commands of יהוה their Elohim, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and bowed down to all the army of the heavens, and served Ba'al.
\v 17 They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, to provoke Him to anger.
\v 18 Therefore יהוה was very angry with Yisra'el, and removed them out of His sight: there was none left but the tribe of Yehudah only.
\p
\v 19 Also Yehudah did not guard the commands of יהוה their Elohim, but walked in the statutes of Yisra'el which they made.
\v 20 יהוה rejected all the seed of Yisra'el, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight.
\p
\v 21 For He tore Yisra'el from the house of David; and they made Yarovam the son of Nevat king: and Yarovam drove Yisra'el from following יהוה, and made them sin a great sin.
\v 22 The children of Yisra'el walked in all the sins of Yarovam which he did; they did not depart from them;
\v 23 until יהוה removed Yisra'el out of His sight, as He spoke by all His servants the prophets. So Yisra'el was carried away out of their own land to Ashuwr to this day.
\p
\v 24 The king of Ashuwr brought men from Bavel, and from Kuthah, and from Avva, and from Ḥamath and Sepharvayim, and placed them in the cities of Shom'ron instead of the children of Yisra'el; and they possessed Shom'ron, and lived in the cities of it.
\v 25 So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they did not fear יהוה: therefore יהוה sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
\v 26 Therefore they spoke to the king of Ashuwr, saying, "The nations which you have carried away, and placed in the cities of Shom'ron, do not know the judgment of the Elohim of the land. Therefore He has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them, because they do not know the judgment of the Elohim of the land."
\p
\v 27 Then the king of Ashuwr commanded, saying, "Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the judgment of the Elohim of the land."
\v 28 So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Shom'ron came and lived in Beth-El, and taught them how they should fear יהוה.
\p
\v 29 However every nation made elohim of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Shomeronites had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.
\v 30 The men of Bavel made Sukkoth Benoth, and the men of Kuth made Nergal, and the men of Ḥamath made Ashima,
\v 31 and the Avvites made Nivḥaz and Tartaq; and the Sepharvayites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelekh and Anammelekh, the eloah of Sepharvayim.
\v 32 So they feared יהוה, and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places, who made offerings for them in the houses of the high places.
\v 33 They feared יהוה, and served their own elohim, after the judgment of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
\p
\v 34 To this day they do what they did before: they do not fear יהוה, neither do they follow their statutes, or their judgments, or the Torah or the command which יהוה commanded the children of Ya'aqov, whom He named Yisra'el;
\v 35 with whom יהוה had cut a covenant, and commanded them, saying, "You shall not fear other elohim, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor slaughter to them;
\v 36 but you shall fear יהוה, who brought you up out of the land of Mitsrayim with great power and with an outstretched Arm, and you shall bow yourselves to Him, and you shall slaughter to Him.
\v 37 The statutes and the judgments, and the Torah and the command, which He wrote for you, you shall guard to do forevermore. You shall not fear other elohim.
\v 38 You shall not forget the covenant that I cut with you; neither shall you fear other elohim.
\v 39 But you shall fear יהוה your Elohim; and He will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies."
\v 40 However they did not listen, but they did according to their former judgment.
\v 41 So these nations feared יהוה, and served their engraved images. Their children likewise, and their children's children, as their fathers did, so they do to this day.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 Now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Yisra'el, that Ḥizqiyah the son of Aḥaz king of Yehudah began to reign.
\v 2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Avi the daughter of Zekharyah.
\v 3 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, according to all that David his father had done.
\v 4 He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he broke in pieces the copper naḥash that Mosheh had made; for to those days the children of Yisra'el did burn incense to it; and he called it Neḥushtan.
\v 5 He relied on יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Yehudah, nor among them that were before him.
\v 6 For he joined with יהוה; he did not depart from following Him, but guarded His commands, which יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 7 יהוה was with him; wherever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Ashuwr, and did not serve him.
\v 8 He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
\p
\v 9 It happened in the fourth year of king Ḥizqiyahu, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Yisra'el, that Shalmaneser king of Ashuwr came up against Shom'ron, and besieged it.
\v 10 At the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Ḥizqiyah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Yisra'el, Shom'ron was taken.
\v 11 The king of Ashuwr carried Yisra'el away to Ashuwr, and put them in Ḥalah, and on the Ḥavor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
\v 12 because they did not obey the voice of יהוה their Elohim, but transgressed His covenant, even all that Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.
\p
\v 13 Now in the fourteenth year of king Ḥizqiyah did Sanḥeriv king of Ashuwr come up against all the fortified cities of Yehudah, and took them.
\v 14 Ḥizqiyah king of Yehudah sent to the king of Ashuwr to Lakish, saying, "I have offended; return from me. That which you put on me, I will bear." The king of Ashuwr appointed to Ḥizqiyah king of Yehudah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
\v 15 Ḥizqiyah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of יהוה, and in the treasures of the king's house.
\v 16 At that time did Ḥizqiyah cut off the doors of the Temple of יהוה, and from the pillars which Ḥizqiyah king of Yehudah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Ashuwr.
\p
\v 17 The king of Ashuwr sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Ravshaqeh from Lakish to king Ḥizqiyahu with a great army to Yerushalayim. They went up and came to Yerushalayim. When they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.
\v 18 When they had called to the king, there came out to them Elyaqim the son of Ḥilqiyahu, who was over the household, and Shevnah the scribe, and Yoaḥ the son of Asaph the recorder.
\p
\v 19 Ravshaqeh said to them, "Say now to Ḥizqiyahu, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Ashuwr, "What confidence is this on which you rely?
\v 20 You say (but they are but vain words), 'There is counsel and strength for war.' Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?
\v 21 Now, behold, you rely on the staff of this bruised reed, even in Mitsrayim. If a man leans on it, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Mitsrayim to all who rely on him.
\v 22 But if you tell me, 'We rely on יהוה our Elohim;' is that not He whose high places and whose altars Ḥizqiyahu has taken away, and has said to Yehudah and to Yerushalayim, 'You shall bow down before this altar in Yerushalayim'?
\v 23 Now therefore, please give pledges to my master the king of Ashuwr, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
\v 24 How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and rely on Mitsrayim for chariots and for horsemen?
\v 25 Have I now come up without יהוה against this place to destroy it? יהוה said to me, 'Go up against this land, and destroy it.'"'"
\p
\v 26 Then Elyaqim the son of Ḥilqiyahu, and Shevnah, and Yoaḥ, said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic; for we understand it. Do not speak with us in the Yehudite language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
\v 27 But Rabshakeh said to them, "Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?"
\p
\v 28 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Yehudite language, and spoke, saying, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Ashuwr.
\v 29 Thus says the king, 'Do not let Ḥizqiyahu deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand.
\v 30 Neither let Ḥizqiyahu make you rely on יהוה, saying, "יהוה will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Ashuwr."
\v 31 Do not listen to Ḥizqiyahu.' For thus says the king of Ashuwr, 'Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern;
\v 32 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die. Do not listen to Ḥizqiyahu, when he persuades you, saying, "יהוה will deliver us."
\v 33 Have any of the elohim of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Ashuwr?
\v 34 Where are the elohim of Ḥamath, and of Arpad? Where are the elohim of Sepharvayim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Shom'ron out of my hand?
\v 35 Who are they among all the elohim of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that יהוה should deliver Yerushalayim out of my hand?'"
\p
\v 36 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
\v 37 Then Elyaqim the son of Ḥilqiyah, who was over the household, came with Shevna the scribe, and Yoaḥ the son of Asaph the recorder, to Ḥizqiyahu with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 It happened, when king Ḥizqiyahu heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of יהוה.
\v 2 He sent Elyaqim, who was over the household, and Shevna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Yeshayahu the prophet the son of Amots.
\v 3 They said to him, "Thus says Ḥizqiyahu, 'This day is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them.
\v 4 It may be יהוה your Elohim will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Ashuwr his master has sent to defy the living Elohim, and will rebuke the words which יהוה your Elohim has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.'"
\p
\v 5 So the servants of king Ḥizqiyahu came to Yeshayahu.
\v 6 Yeshuayahu said to them, "Thus you shall tell your master, 'Thus says יהוה, "Do not be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Ashuwr have blasphemed Me.
\v 7 Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."'"
\p
\v 8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Ashuwr warring against Livnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lakish.
\v 9 When he heard it said of Tirhaqah king of Kush, "Behold, he has come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Ḥizqiyahu, saying,
\v 10 'Thus you shall speak to Ḥizqiyahu king of Yehudah, saying, "Do not let your Elohim on whom you rely deceive you, saying, 'Yerushalayim will not be given into the hand of the king of Ashuwr.'
\v 11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Ashuwr have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Will you be delivered?
\v 12 Have the elohim of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Ḥaran, and Retseph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?
\v 13 Where is the king of Ḥamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvayim, of Hena, and Ivvah?"'"
\p
\v 14 Ḥizqiyahu received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. Then Ḥizqiyahu went up to the house of יהוה, and spread it before יהוה.
\v 15 Ḥizqiyahu prayed before יהוה, and said, "יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, who sits above the keruvim, You are the Elohim, even You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.
\v 16 Incline Your ear, יהוה, and hear. Open Your eyes, יהוה, and see. Hear the words of Sanḥeriv, with which he has sent to defy the living Elohim.
\v 17 Truly, יהוה, the kings of Ashuwr have laid waste the nations and their lands,
\v 18 and have cast their elohim into the fire; for they were no elohim, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.
\v 19 Now therefore, יהוה our Elohim, save us, I beg You, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You, יהוה, are Elohim alone."
\p
\v 20 Then Yeshayahu the son of Amots sent to Ḥizqiyahu, saying, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'Whereas you have prayed to Me against Sanḥeriv king of Ashuwr, I have heard you.
\p
\v 21 This is the word that יהוה has spoken concerning him: "The virgin daughter of Tsion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Yerushalayim has shaken her head at you.
\v 22 Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Set-apart One of Yisra'el.
\v 23 By your messengers you have defied יהוה, and have said, 'With the multitude of my chariots, I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Levanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees; and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field.
\v 24 I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Mitsrayim.'
\p
\v 25 "Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now have I brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
\v 26 Therefore their inhabitants were small of hand. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like grain blasted before it has grown up.
\v 27 But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against Me.
\v 28 Because of your raging against Me, and because your arrogance has come up into My ears, therefore will I put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came."
\p
\v 29 "'This shall be the sign to you: You shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat its fruit.
\v 30 The remnant that has escaped of the house of Yehudah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\v 31 For out of Yerushalayim a remnant will go out, and out of Mount Tsion those who shall escape. The zeal of יהוה will perform this.'
\p
\v 32 "Therefore thus says יהוה concerning the king of Ashuwr, 'He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
\v 33 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come to this city,' says יהוה.
\v 34 'For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake, and for My servant David's sake.'"
\p
\v 35 It happened that night, that the messenger of יהוה went out, and struck one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Ashuwrites. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
\v 36 So Sanḥeriv king of Ashuwr departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.
\v 37 It happened, as he was bowing down in the house of Nisrok his el, that Adrammelekh and Sharetser struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar-Ḥaddon his son reigned in his place.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 In those days was Ḥizqiyahu sick to death. Yeshayahu the prophet the son of Amots came to him, and said to him, "Thus says יהוה, 'Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.'"
\v 2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to יהוה, saying,
\v 3 "Remember now, יהוה, I beg You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in Your eyes." Ḥizqiyahu wept very bitterly.
\v 4 It happened, before Yeshayahu had gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of יהוה came to him, saying,
\v 5 "Turn back, and tell Ḥizqiyahu the prince of My people, 'Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of David your father, "I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On the third day, you shall go up to the house of יהוה.
\v 6 I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Ashuwr. I will defend this city for My own sake, and for My servant David's sake."'"
\v 7 And Yeshayahu said, "Take a cake of figs." They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
\p
\v 8 Ḥizqiyahu said to Yeshayahu, "What shall be the sign that יהוה will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of יהוה the third day?"
\v 9 Yeshayahu said, "This shall be the sign to you from יהוה, that יהוה will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?"
\v 10 Ḥizqiyahu answered, "It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. Nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps."
\v 11 Yeshayahu the prophet cried to יהוה; and He brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Aḥaz.
\p
\v 12 At that time Berodak Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Bavel, sent letters and a present to Ḥizqiyahu; for he had heard that Ḥizqiyahu had been sick.
\v 13 Ḥizqiyahu listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Ḥizqiyahu did not show them.
\v 14 Then Yeshayahu the prophet came to king Ḥizqiyahu, and said to him, "What did these men say? From where did they come to you?" Ḥizqiyahu said, "They are come from a far country, even from Bavel."
\v 15 He said, "What have they seen in your house?" Ḥizqiyahu answered, "They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."
\p
\v 16 Yeshayahu said to Ḥizqiyahu, "Hear the word of יהוה.
\v 17 'Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Bavel. Nothing shall be left,' says יהוה.
\v 18 'Of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall father, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Bavel.'"
\v 19 Then Ḥizqiyahu said to Yeshayahu, "The word of יהוה which you have spoken is good." He said moreover, "Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?"
\p
\v 20 Now the rest of the acts of Ḥizqiyahu, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Ḥizqiyahu slept with his fathers; and Menasheh his son reigned in his place.
\p
\v 21 Menasheh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Ḥephtsivah.
\v 2 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, after the abominations of the nations whom יהוה cast out before the children of Yisra'el.
\v 3 For he built again the high places which Ḥizqiyahu his father had destroyed; and he raised up altars for Ba'al, and made an Asherah, as did Aḥav king of Yisra'el, and bowed down to all the army of the heavens, and served them.
\v 4 He built altars in the house of יהוה, of which יהוה said, "I will put My Name in Yerushalayim."
\v 5 He built altars for all the army of the heavens in the two courts of the house of יהוה.
\v 6 He made his son to pass through the fire, and practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and dealt with mediums, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of יהוה, to provoke Him to anger.
\v 7 He set the engraved image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which יהוה said to David and to Shelomoh his son, "In this house, and in Yerushalayim, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra'el, will I put My Name forever;
\v 8 neither will I cause the feet of Yisra'el to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will guard to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the Torah that My servant Mosheh commanded them."
\v 9 But they did not listen: and Menasheh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom יהוה destroyed before the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 10 יהוה spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
\v 11 "Because Menasheh king of Yehudah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Yehudah also to sin with his idols;
\v 12 therefore thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'Behold, I bring such evil on Yerushalayim and Yehudah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
\v 13 I will stretch over Yerushalayim the line of Shom'ron, and the plummet of the house of Aḥav; and I will wipe Yerushalayim as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
\v 14 I will cast off the remnant of My inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies. They will become a plunder and a spoil to all their enemies;
\v 15 because they have done that which is evil in My sight, and have provoked Me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Mitsrayim, even to this day.'"
\p
\v 16 Moreover Menasheh shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Yerushalayim from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Yehudah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of יהוה.
\v 17 Now the rest of the acts of Menasheh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\v 18 Menasheh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his place.
\p
\v 19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Ḥaruts of Yotbah.
\v 20 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, as did Menasheh his father.
\v 21 He walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and bowed down to them:
\v 22 and he forsook יהוה, the Elohim of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of יהוה.
\v 23 The servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.
\v 24 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Yoshiyahu his son king in his place.
\v 25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\v 26 He was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza: and Yoshiyahu his son reigned in his place.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Yoshiyahu was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Yedidah the daughter of Adayah of Botsqath.
\v 2 He did that which was right in the eyes of יהוה, and walked in all the way of David his father, and did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\p
\v 3 It happened in the eighteenth year of King Yoshiyahu, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Atsalyahu the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of יהוה, saying,
\v 4 "Go up to Ḥilqiyahu the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of יהוה, which the guards of the threshold have gathered of the people.
\v 5 Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of יהוה; and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of יהוה, to repair the breaches of the house,
\v 6 to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house.
\v 7 However there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt in faithfulness."
\p
\v 8 Ḥilqiyahu the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the book of the Torah in the house of יהוה." Ḥilqiyah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
\v 9 Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, "Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of יהוה."
\v 10 Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, "Ḥilqiyah the priest has delivered a book to me." Shaphan read it before the king.
\p
\v 11 It happened, when the king had heard the words of the book of the Torah, that he tore his clothes.
\v 12 The king commanded Ḥilqiyah the priest, and Aḥiqam the son of Shaphan, and Akbor the son of Mikhayah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asayah the king's servant, saying,
\v 13 "Go inquire of יהוה for me, and for the people, and for all Yehudah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of יהוה that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us."
\p
\v 14 So Ḥilqiyahu the priest, and Aḥiqam, and Akbor, and Shaphan, and Asayah, went to Ḥuldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Ḥarḥas, guard of the wardrobe (now she lived in Yerushalayim in the second quarter); and they talked with her.
\v 15 She said to them, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el: 'Tell the man who sent you to Me,
\v 16 "Thus says יהוה, 'Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Yehudah has read.
\v 17 Because they have forsaken Me, and have burned incense to other elohim, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore My wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.'"
\v 18 But to the king of Yehudah, who sent you to inquire of יהוה, thus you shall tell him, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el: 'Concerning the words which you have heard,
\v 19 because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before יהוה when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before Me; I also have heard you,' says יהוה.
\v 20 'Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place.'"' They brought back this message to the king.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 The king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Yehudah and of Yerushalayim.
\v 2 The king went up to the house of יהוה, and all the men of Yehudah and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of יהוה.
\v 3 The king stood by the pillar, and cut a covenant before יהוה, to walk after יהוה, and to guard His commands, and His witnesses, and His statutes, with all his heart, and all his being, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.
\p
\v 4 The king commanded Ḥilqiyahu the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the guards of the threshold, to bring forth out of the Temple of יהוה all the vessels that were made for Ba'al, and for the Asherah, and for all the army of the heavens, and he burned them outside of Yerushalayim in the fields of the Qidron, and carried the ashes of them to Beth-El.
\v 5 He caused the idol-priests to cease, whom the kings of Yehudah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Yehudah, and in the places around Yerushalayim; those also who burned incense to Ba'al, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of the heavens.
\v 6 He brought out the Asherah from the house of יהוה, outside of Yerushalayim, to the wadi Qidron, and burned it at the wadi Qidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves of the common people.
\v 7 He broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of יהוה, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.
\v 8 He brought all the priests out of the cities of Yehudah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geva to Beersheva; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Yehoshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
\p
\v 9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of יהוה in Yerushalayim, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.
\v 10 He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molekh.
\v 11 He caused the horses to cease, those that the kings of Yehudah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of יהוה, by the room of Nathan Melekh the officer, who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
\v 12 The altars that were on the roof of the upper room of Aḥaz, which the kings of Yehudah had made, and the altars which Menasheh had made in the two courts of the house of יהוה, did the king break down, and beat them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the wadi Qidron.
\v 13 The high places that were before Yerushalayim, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Shelomoh the king of Yisra'el had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Tsidonians, and for Kemosh the abomination of Moav, and for Milkom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
\v 14 He broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.
\p
\v 15 Moreover the altar that was at Beth-El, and the high place which Yarovam the son of Nevat, who made Yisra'el to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.
\v 16 As Yoshiyahu turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of יהוה which the man of Elohim proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.
\p
\v 17 Then he said, "What monument is that which I see?" The men of the city told him, "It is the tomb of the man of Elohim, who came from Yehudah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Beth-El."
\v 18 He said, "Let him be! Let no man move his bones." So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Shom'ron.
\v 19 All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Shom'ron, which the kings of Yisra'el had made to provoke יהוה to anger, Yoshiyahu took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-El.
\v 20 He slaughtered all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned men's bones on them; and he returned to Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 21 The king commanded all the people, saying, "Keep the Pesaḥ to יהוה your Elohim, as it is written in this book of the covenant."
\v 22 Surely there was not kept such a Pesaḥ from the days of the judges who judged Yisra'el, nor in all the days of the kings of Yisra'el, nor of the kings of Yehudah;
\v 23 but in the eighteenth year of King Yoshiyahu was this Pesaḥ kept to יהוה in Yerushalayim.
\p
\v 24 Moreover the mediums, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Yehudah and in Yerushalayim, did Yoshiyahu put away, that he might confirm the words of the Torah which were written in the book that Ḥilqiyahu the priest found in the house of יהוה.
\p
\v 26 Notwithstanding, יהוה did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which His anger was kindled against Yehudah, because of all the provocation with which Menasheh had provoked Him.
\v 27 יהוה said, "I will remove Yehudah also out of my sight, as I have removed Yisra'el, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Yerushalayim, and the house of which I said, 'My Name shall be there.'"
\p
\v 28 Now the rest of the acts of Yoshiyahu, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\v 29 In his days Pharaoh Nekhoh king of Mitsrayim went up against the king of Ashuwr to the Perath River: and King Yoshiyahu went against him; and Pharaoh Nekhoh killed him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
\v 30 His servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Yerushalayim, and buried him in his own grave. The people of the land took Yehoaḥaz the son of Yoshiyahu, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's place.
\p
\v 31 Yehoaḥaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three new moons in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Ḥamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu of Livnah.
\v 32 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, according to all that his fathers had done.
\v 33 Pharaoh Nekhoh put him in bonds at Rivlah in the land of Ḥamath, that he might not reign in Yerushalayim; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
\p
\v 34 Pharaoh Nekhoh made Elyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu king in the place of Yoshiyahu his father, and changed his name to Yehoyaqim: but he took Yehoaḥaz away; and he came to Mitsrayim, and died there.
\v 35 Yehoyaqim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the command of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaoh Nekhoh.
\p
\v 36 Yehoyaqim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Zevidah the daughter of Pedayah of Rumah.
\v 37 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, according to all that his fathers had done.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 In his days Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel came up, and Yehoyaqim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
\v 2 יהוה sent against him bands of the Kaldeans, and bands of the Arameans, and bands of the Moavites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Yehudah to destroy it, according to the word of יהוה, which He spoke by His servants the prophets.
\v 3 Surely at the command of יהוה came this on Yehudah, to remove them out of His sight, for the sins of Menasheh, according to all that he did,
\v 4 and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Yerushalayim with innocent blood: and יהוה would not pardon.
\v 5 Now the rest of the acts of Yehoyaqim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yehudah?
\p
\v 6 So Yehoyaqim slept with his fathers; and Yehoyakin his son reigned in his place.
\v 7 The king of Mitsrayim did not come again out of his land any more; for the king of Bavel had taken, from the wadi of Mitsrayim to the Perath River, all that pertained to the king of Mitsrayim.
\p
\v 8 Yehoyakin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Yerushalayim three new moons: and his mother's name was Neḥushta the daughter of Elnathan of Yerushalayim.
\v 9 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, according to all that his father had done.
\p
\v 10 At that time the servants of Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel came up to Yerushalayim, and the city was besieged.
\v 11 Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel came to the city, while his servants were besieging it;
\v 12 and Yehoyakin the king of Yehudah went out to the king of Bavel, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Bavel took him in the eighth year of his reign.
\v 13 He carried out there all the treasures of the house of יהוה, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Shelomoh king of Yisra'el had made in the Temple of יהוה, as יהוה had said.
\v 14 He carried away all Yerushalayim, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, except the poorest sort of the people of the land.
\p
\v 15 He carried away Yehoyakin to Bavel; and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Yerushalayim to Bavel.
\v 16 All the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Bavel brought captive to Bavel.
\p
\v 17 The king of Bavel made Mattanyah, Yehoyakin's father's brother, king is his place, and changed his name to Tsidqiyahu.
\p
\v 18 Tsidqiyahu was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim: and his mother's name was Ḥamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu of Livnah.
\v 19 He did that which was evil in the sight of יהוה, according to all that Yehoyaqim had done.
\v 20 For through the anger of יהוה did it happen in Yerushalayim and Yehudah, until He had cast them out from His presence. Tsidqiyahu rebelled against the king of Bavel.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth new moon, in the tenth day of the new moon, that Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel came, he and all his army, against Yerushalayim, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it around it.
\v 2 So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of King Tsidqiyahu.
\v 3 On the ninth day of the new moon the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\v 4 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden (now the Kaldeans were against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Aravah.
\p
\v 5 But the army of the Kaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Yeriḥo; and all his army was scattered from him.
\v 6 Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Bavel to Rivlah; and they gave judgment on him.
\v 7 They killed the sons of Tsidqiyahu before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Tsidqiyahu and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Bavel.
\p
\v 8 Now in the fifth new moon, on the seventh day of the new moon, which was the nineteenth year of King Nevukhadnetsar, king of Bavel, came Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Bavel, to Yerushalayim.
\v 9 He burned the house of יהוה, and the king's house; and all the houses of Yerushalayim, even every great house, he burned with fire.
\v 10 All the army of the Kaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Yerushalayim.
\v 11 The residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Bavel, and the residue of the multitude, did Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.
\v 12 But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
\p
\v 13 The pillars of copper that were in the house of יהוה, and the bases and the copper sea that were in the house of יהוה, did the Kaldeans break in pieces, and carried the copper of them to Bavel.
\v 14 The pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of copper with which they ministered, took they away.
\v 15 The fire pans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
\v 16 The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Shelomoh had made for the house of יהוה, the copper of all these vessels was without weight.
\v 17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of copper was on it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital around it, all of copper: and like to these had the second pillar with network.
\p
\v 18 The captain of the guard took Serayah the chief priest, and Tsephanyahu the second priest, and the three guards of the threshold:
\v 19 and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the city.
\v 20 Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Bavel to Rivlah.
\v 21 The king of Bavel struck them, and put them to death at Rivlah in the land of Ḥamath. So Yehudah was carried away captive out of his land.
\p
\v 22 As for the people who were left in the land of Yehudah, whom Nevukhadnetsar king of Bavel had left, even over them he made Gedalyahu the son of Aḥiqam, the son of Shaphan, governor.
\v 23 Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Bavel had made Gedalyahu governor, they came to Gedalyahu to Mitspah, even Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah, and Yoḥanan the son of Qareaḥ, and Serayah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Ya'azanyahu the son of the Ma'akathite, they and their men.
\p
\v 24 Gedalyahu swore to them and to their men, and said to them, "Do not be afraid because of the servants of the Kaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Bavel, and it shall be well with you."
\p
\v 25 But it happened in the seventh new moon, that Yishma'el the son of Nethanyah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedalyahu, so that he died, and the Yehudim and the Kaldeans that were with him at Mitspah.
\v 26 All the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Mitsrayim; for they were afraid of the Kaldeans.
\p
\v 27 It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Yehoyakin king of Yehudah, in the twelfth new moon, on the seven and twentieth day of the new moon, that Evilmerodak king of Bavel, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Yehoyakin king of Yehudah out of prison;
\v 28 and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Bavel,
\v 29 and changed his prison garments. He ate bread before him continually all the days of his life:
\v 30 and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.
