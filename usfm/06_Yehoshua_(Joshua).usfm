\v 1 Now it happened after the death of Mosheh the servant of יהוה, that יהוה spoke to Yehoshua the son of Nun, Mosheh's servant, saying,
\v 2 "Mosheh My servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Yarden, you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them, even to the children of Yisra'el.
\v 3 I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Mosheh.
\v 4 From the wilderness, and this Levanon, even to the great river, the Perath River, all the land of the Ḥittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
\v 5 No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Mosheh, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.
\v 6 Be strong and courageous; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
\v 7 Only be strong and very courageous, to guard to do according to all the Torah, which Mosheh My servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.
\v 8 This book of the Torah shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may guard to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.
\v 9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid, neither be dismayed: for יהוה your Elohim is with you wherever you go."
\p
\v 10 Then Yehoshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\v 11 "Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, 'Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass over this Yarden, to go in to possess the land, which יהוה your Elohim gives you to possess it.'"
\p
\v 12 Yehoshua spoke to the Reuvenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Menasheh, saying,
\v 13 "Remember the word which Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded you, saying, 'יהוה your Elohim gives you rest, and will give you this land.
\v 14 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live in the land which Mosheh gave you beyond the Yarden; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them
\v 15 until יהוה has given your brothers rest, as He has given you, and they have also possessed the land which יהוה your Elohim gives them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, and possess it, which Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave you beyond the Yarden toward the sunrise.'"
\p
\v 16 They answered Yehoshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
\v 17 Just as we listened to Mosheh in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may יהוה your Elohim be with you, as He was with Mosheh.
\v 18 Whoever rebels against your command, and does not listen to your words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."

\p
\v 1 Yehoshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, including Yeriḥo." They went and came into the house of a whore whose name was Raḥav, and slept there.
\v 2 The king of Yeriḥo was told, "Behold, men of the children of Yisra'el came in here tonight to spy out the land."
\v 3 The king of Yeriḥo sent to Raḥav, saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the land."
\v 4 The woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they came from.
\v 5 It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went, I do not know. Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them."
\v 6 But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.
\v 7 The men pursued them the way to the Yarden to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.
\p
\v 8 Before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof;
\v 9 and she said to the men, "I know that יהוה has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
\v 10 For we have heard how יהוה dried up the water of the Sea of Reeds before you, when you came out of Mitsrayim; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Yarden, to Siḥon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
\v 11 As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for יהוה your Elohim, He is Elohim in heavens above, and on earth beneath.
\v 12 Now therefore, please swear to me by יהוה, since I have dealt in loving-kindness with you, that you also will deal in loving-kindness with my father's house, and give me a true token;
\v 13 and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our beings from death."
\v 14 The men said to her, "Our being for yours, if you do not talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when יהוה gives us the land, that we will deal in loving-kindness and truth with you."
\p
\v 15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall.
\v 16 She said to them, "Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way."
\v 17 The men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear.
\v 18 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by. You shall gather to yourself into the house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.
\v 19 It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him.
\v 20 But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear."
\v 21 She said, "According to your words, so be it." She sent them away, and they departed. She tied the scarlet line in the window.
\p
\v 22 They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but did not find them.
\v 23 Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain, passed over, and came to Yehoshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had happened to them.
\v 24 They said to Yehoshua, "Truly יהוה has delivered into our hands all the land. Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us."
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Yehoshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim, and came to the Yarden, he and all the children of Yisra'el. They lodged there before they passed over.
\v 2 It happened after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;
\v 3 and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark of the covenant of יהוה your Elohim, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place, and follow it.
\v 4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near to it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed this way before."
\p
\v 5 Yehoshua said to the people, "Set yourselves apart; for tomorrow יהוה will do wonders among you."
\v 6 Yehoshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people." They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
\p
\v 7 יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Today I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Yisra'el, that they may know that as I was with Mosheh, so I will be with you.
\v 8 You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Yarden, you shall stand still in the Yarden.'"
\v 9 Yehoshua said to the children of Yisra'el, "Come here, and hear the words of יהוה your Elohim."
\v 10 Yehoshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living El is among you, and that He will without fail drive the Kena'anite, and the Ḥittite, and the Ḥivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Yevusite out from before you.
\v 11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of Adonai of all the earth passes over before you into the Yarden.
\v 12 Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Yisra'el, for every tribe a man.
\v 13 It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of יהוה, Adonai of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Yarden, that the waters of the Yarden will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap."
\p
\v 14 It happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Yarden, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people,
\v 15 and when those who bore the ark had come to the Yarden, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped in the edge of the water (for the Yarden overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),
\v 16 that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Tsarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Aravah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed over right against Yeriḥo.
\v 17 The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Yarden; and all Yisra'el passed over on dry ground, until all the nation had passed completely over the Yarden.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 It happened, when all the nation had completely passed over the Yarden, that יהוה spoke to Yehoshua, saying,
\v 2 "Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
\v 3 and command them, saying, 'Take from out of the middle of the Yarden, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'"
\v 4 Then Yehoshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Yisra'el, out of every tribe a man.
\v 5 Yehoshua said to them, "Pass over before the ark of יהוה your Elohim into the middle of the Yarden, and each of you pick up a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Yisra'el;
\v 6 that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying, 'What do you mean by these stones?'
\v 7 then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of the Yarden were cut off before the ark of the covenant of יהוה. When it passed over the Yarden, the waters of the Yarden were cut off. These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Yisra'el forever.'"
\p
\v 8 The children of Yisra'el did as Yehoshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Yarden, as יהוה spoke to Yehoshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Yisra'el; and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
\v 9 Yehoshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Yarden, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.
\v 10 For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Yarden, until everything was finished that יהוה commanded Yehoshua to speak to the people, according to all that Mosheh commanded Yehoshua; and the people hurried and passed over.
\v 11 It happened, when all the people had completely passed over, that the ark of יהוה passed over, with the priests, in the presence of the people.
\v 12 The children of Reuven, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Menasheh, passed over armed before the children of Yisra'el, as Mosheh spoke to them.
\v 13 About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed over before יהוה to battle, to the plains of Yeriḥo.
\p
\v 14 On that day, יהוה magnified Yehoshua in the sight of all Yisra'el; and they feared him, as they feared Mosheh, all the days of his life.
\p
\v 15 יהוה spoke to Yehoshua, saying,
\v 16 "Command the priests who bear the ark of the witness, that they come up out of the Yarden."
\v 17 Yehoshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out of the Yarden!"
\v 18 It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה had come up out of the middle of the Yarden, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Yarden returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as before.
\p
\v 19 The people came up out of the Yarden on the tenth day of the first new moon, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Yeriḥo.
\v 20 Yehoshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of the Yarden, in Gilgal.
\v 21 He spoke to the children of Yisra'el, saying, "When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What do these stones mean?'
\v 22 Then you shall let your children know, saying, 'Yisra'el came over this Yarden on dry land.
\v 23 For יהוה your Elohim dried up the waters of the Yarden from before you, until you had passed over, as יהוה your Elohim did to the Sea of Reeds, which He dried up from before us, until we had passed over;
\v 24 that all the peoples of the earth may know the Hand of יהוה, that it is mighty; that you may fear יהוה your Elohim forever.'"
\c 5
\p
\v 1 It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Yarden westward, and all the kings of the Kena'anites, who were by the sea, heard how that יהוה had dried up the waters of the Yarden from before the children of Yisra'el, until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 2 At that time, יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Make flint knives, and circumcise again the children of Yisra'el the second time."
\v 3 Yehoshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children of Yisra'el at the hill of the foreskins.
\v 4 This is the reason Yehoshua circumcised: all the people who came out of Mitsrayim, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Mitsrayim.
\v 5 For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Mitsrayim had not been circumcised.
\v 6 For the children of Yisra'el walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Mitsrayim, were consumed, because they did not listen to the voice of יהוה. יהוה swore to them that He would not let them see the land which יהוה swore to their fathers that He would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 7 Their children, whom He raised up in their place, were circumcised by Yehoshua; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.
\p
\v 8 It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed.
\v 9 יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Mitsrayim from off you." Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.
\p
\v 10 The children of Yisra'el encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Pesaḥ on the fourteenth day of the new moon at evening in the plains of Yeriḥo.
\v 11 They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Pesaḥ, in the same day.
\v 12 The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Yisra'el did not have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Kena'an that year.
\p
\v 13 It happened, when Yehoshua was by Yeriḥo, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Yehoshua went to him, and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
\v 14 He said, "No; but I have come now as commander of the army of יהוה." Yehoshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said to him, "What does my master say to his servant?"
\v 15 The captain of the army of יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Take your shoes off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is set-apart." Yehoshua did so.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now Yeriḥo was tightly closed up because of the children of Yisra'el. No one went out, and no one came in.
\v 2 יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Behold, I have given Yeriḥo into your hand, with its king and the mighty men of valor.
\v 3 All your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days.
\v 4 Seven priests shall bear seven shofars of yovelim before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the shofars.
\v 5 It shall be that when they make a long blast with the yovel, and when you hear the sound of the shofar, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him."
\p
\v 6 Yehoshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven shofars of yovelim before the ark of יהוה."
\v 7 They said to the people, "Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of יהוה."
\v 8 It was so, that when Yehoshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven shofars of yovelim before יהוה advanced, and blew the shofars; and the ark of the covenant of יהוה followed them.
\v 9 The armed men went before the priests who blew the shofars, and the ark went after them. The shofars sounded as they went.
\v 10 Yehoshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout."
\v 11 So he caused the ark of יהוה to go around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
\p
\v 12 Yehoshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of יהוה.
\v 13 The seven priests bearing the seven shofars of yovelim before the ark of יהוה went on continually, and blew the shofars: and the armed men went before them. The rear guard came after the ark of יהוה. The shofars sounded as they went.
\v 14 The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.
\p
\v 15 It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same judgment seven times. Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.
\v 16 It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the shofars, Yehoshua said to the people, "Shout, for יהוה has given you the city!
\v 17 The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to יהוה. Only Raḥav the whore shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
\v 18 But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so would you make the camp of Yisra'el accursed, and trouble it.
\v 19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of copper and iron, are set-apart to יהוה. They shall come into the treasury of יהוה."
\v 20 So the people shouted, and the priests blew the shofars. It happened, when the people heard the sound of the shofar, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
\v 21 They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
\p
\v 22 Yehoshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the whore's house, and bring out from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."
\v 23 The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Raḥav with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Yisra'el.
\v 24 They burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of copper and of iron into the treasury of the house of יהוה.
\v 25 But Raḥav the whore, her father's household, and all that she had, Yehoshua saved alive. She lived in the midst of Yisra'el to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Yehoshua sent to spy out Yeriḥo.
\p
\v 26 Yehoshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed is the man before יהוה, who rises up and builds this city Yeriḥo. With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."
\v 27 So יהוה was with Yehoshua; and his fame was in all the land.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 But the children of Yisra'el committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Aḥan, the son of Karmi, the son of Zavdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Yehudah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore the anger of יהוה burned against the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 2 Yehoshua sent men from Yeriḥo to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Beth-El, and spoke to them, saying, "Go up and spy out the land." The men went up and spied out Ai.
\v 3 They returned to Yehoshua, and said to him, "Do not let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them."
\v 4 So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.
\v 5 The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them, and they chased them from before the gate even to Shevarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water.
\p
\v 6 Yehoshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of יהוה until the evening, he and the elders of Yisra'el; and they put dust on their heads.
\v 7 Yehoshua said, "Alas, Adonai יהוה, why have You brought this people over the Yarden at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? Oh that we had been content and lived beyond the Yarden!
\v 8 Oh, יהוה, what shall I say, after that Yisra'el has turned their backs before their enemies!
\v 9 For the Kena'anites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will You do for Your great Name?"
\p
\v 10 יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Get up! Why are you fallen on your face like that?
\v 11 Yisra'el has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own stuff.
\v 12 Therefore the children of Yisra'el cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.
\v 13 "Get up! Set the people apart, and say, 'Set yourselves apart for tomorrow, for יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, says, "There is a devoted thing in your midst, Yisra'el. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you."
\v 14 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the tribe which יהוה selects shall come near by families. The family which יהוה selects shall come near by households. The household which יהוה selects shall come near man by man.
\v 15 It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of יהוה, and because he has done a senseless thing in Yisra'el.'"
\p
\v 16 So Yehoshua rose up early in the morning and brought Yisra'el near by their tribes. The tribe of Yehudah was selected.
\v 17 He brought near the family of Yehudah; and he selected the family of the Zeraḥites. He brought near the family of the Zeraḥites man by man, and Zavdi was selected.
\v 18 He brought near his household man by man, and Akan, the son of Karmi, the son of Zavdi, the son of Zeraḥ, of the tribe of Yehudah, was selected.
\v 19 Yehoshua said to Akan, "My son, please give glory to יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, and make confession to Him. Tell me now what you have done! Do not hide it from me!"
\v 20 Akan answered Yehoshua, and said, "I have truly sinned against יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, and this is what I have done.
\v 21 When I saw among the spoil a beautiful robe from the land of Shinar, two hundred sheqels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty sheqels, then I coveted them and took them. Behold, they are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under it."
\p
\v 22 So Yehoshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.
\v 23 They took them from the middle of the tent, and brought them to Yehoshua and to all the children of Yisra'el. They laid them down before יהוה.
\v 24 Yehoshua, and all Yisra'el with him, took Akan the son of Zeraḥ, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Akor.
\v 25 Yehoshua said, "Why have you troubled us? יהוה will trouble you today." All Yisra'el stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.
\v 26 They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. יהוה turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place was called "The Valley of Akor" to this day.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Do not be afraid, neither be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, with his people, his city, and his land.
\v 2 You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Yeriḥo and her king, except its spoil and its livestock, you shall plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it."
\p
\v 3 So Yehoshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. Yehoshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night.
\v 4 He commanded them, saying, "Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.
\v 5 I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.
\v 6 They will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, 'They flee before us, like the first time.' So we will flee before them,
\v 7 and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for יהוה your Elohim will deliver it into your hand.
\v 8 It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do this according to the word of יהוה. Behold, I have commanded you."
\v 9 Yehoshua sent them out; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Beth-El and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Yehoshua stayed among the people that night.
\p
\v 10 Yehoshua rose up early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Yisra'el, before the people to Ai.
\v 11 All the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.
\v 12 He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-El and Ai, on the west side of the city.
\v 13 So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city; and Yehoshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
\v 14 It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Yisra'el to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Aravah; but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
\v 15 Yehoshua and all Yisra'el made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
\v 16 All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued Yehoshua, and were drawn away from the city.
\v 17 There was not a man left in Ai or Beth-El who did not go out after Yisra'el. They left the city open, and pursued Yisra'el.
\p
\v 18 יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." Yehoshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
\v 19 The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire.
\v 20 When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to the heavens, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. The people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.
\v 21 When Yehoshua and all Yisra'el saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.
\v 22 The others came out of the city against them, so they were in the midst of Yisra'el, some on this side, and some on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
\v 23 They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Yehoshua.
\p
\v 24 And it came about, when Yisra'el had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Yisra'el returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.
\v 25 All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
\v 26 For Yehoshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
\v 27 Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Yisra'el plundered to themselves, according to the word of יהוה which He commanded Yehoshua.
\v 28 So Yehoshua burned Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.
\v 29 He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening, and at the sundown Yehoshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day.
\p
\v 30 Then Yehoshua built an altar to יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, in Mount Eyval,
\v 31 as Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded the children of Yisra'el, as it is written in the book of the Torah of Mosheh, an altar of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron. They offered ascension offerings on it to יהוה, and slaughtered peace offerings.
\v 32 He wrote there on the stones a copy of the Torah of Mosheh, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 33 All Yisra'el, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of יהוה, the sojourner as well as the native; half of them in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Eyval, as Mosheh the servant of יהוה had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Yisra'el.
\v 34 Afterward he read all the words of the Torah, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the Torah.
\v 35 There was not a word of all that Mosheh commanded, which Yehoshua did not read before all the assembly of Yisra'el, with the women, the little ones, and the sojourners who were among them.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Yarden, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Levanon, the Ḥittite, the Amorite, the Kena'anite, the Perizzite, the Ḥivite, and the Yevusite, heard of it
\v 2 that they gathered themselves together to fight with Yehoshua and with Yisra'el, with one accord.
\p
\v 3 But when the inhabitants of Givon heard what Yehoshua had done to Yeriḥo and to Ai,
\v 4 they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,
\v 5 and old and patched shoes on their feet, and wore old garments. All the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.
\v 6 They went to Yehoshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Yisra'el, "We have come from a far country. Now therefore cut a covenant with us."
\v 7 The men of Yisra'el said to the Ḥivites, "What if you live among us. How could we cut a covenant with you?"
\v 8 They said to Yehoshua, "We are your servants." Yehoshua said to them, "Who are you? Where do you come from?"
\v 9 They said to him, "Your servants have come from a very far country because of the Name of יהוה your Elohim; for we have heard of His fame, all that He did in Mitsrayim,
\v 10 and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Yarden, to Siḥon king of Ḥeshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
\v 11 Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, 'Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and tell them, "We are your servants. Now cut a covenant with us."'
\v 12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy.
\v 13 These wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey."
\v 14 The men sampled their provisions, and did not ask counsel from the mouth of יהוה.
\v 15 Yehoshua made peace with them, and cut a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them.
\p
\v 16 It happened at the end of three days after they had cut a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they lived among them.
\v 17 The children of Yisra'el traveled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Givon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Qiryath Yearim.
\v 18 The children of Yisra'el did not strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el. All the congregation grumbled against the princes.
\v 19 But all the princes said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el: now therefore we may not touch them.
\v 20 This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them."
\v 21 The princes said to them, "Let them live, so they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them."
\p
\v 22 Yehoshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you live among us?
\v 23 Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my Elohim."
\v 24 They answered Yehoshua, and said, "Because your servants were certainly told how יהוה your Elohim commanded His servant Mosheh to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
\v 25 Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do."
\v 26 He did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Yisra'el, so that they did not kill them.
\v 27 That day Yehoshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of יהוה, to this day, in the place which He should choose.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now it happened when Adoni-Tsedeq king of Yerushalyim heard how Yehoshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Yeriḥo and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Givon had made peace with Yisra'el, and were among them;
\v 2 that they were very afraid, because Givon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
\v 3 Therefore Adoni-Tsedeq king of Yerushalyim sent to Hoham king of Ḥevron, to Piram king of Yarmuth, to Yafia king of Lakish, and to Devir king of Eglon, saying,
\v 4 "Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Givon; for it has made peace with Yehoshua and with the children of Yisra'el."
\v 5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Yerushalyim, the king of Ḥevron, the king of Yarmuth, the king of Lakish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Givon, and made war against it.
\p
\v 6 The men of Givon sent to Yehoshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, "Do not slacken your hands from your servants! Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us."
\v 7 So Yehoshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
\v 8 יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hands. Not a man of them will stand before you."
\v 9 Yehoshua therefore came on them suddenly. He went up from Gilgal all night.
\v 10 יהוה confused them before Yisra'el, and killed them with a great slaughter at Givon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Ḥoron, and struck them to Azeqah and to Maqedah.
\v 11 It happened, as they fled from before Yisra'el, while they were at the descent of Beth Ḥoron, that יהוה cast down great stones from the heavens on them to Azeqah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than who the children of Yisra'el killed with the sword.
\p
\v 12 Then Yehoshua spoke to יהוה in the day when יהוה delivered up the Amorites before the children of Yisra'el; and he said in the sight of Yisra'el, "Sun, stand still on Givon! You, moon, stop in the valley of Aiyalon!"
\p
\v 13 The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of the Upright? The sun stayed in the midst of the heavens, and did not hurry to go down about a whole day.
\p
\v 14 There was no day like that before it or after it, that יהוה listened to the voice of a man; for יהוה fought for Yisra'el.
\p
\v 15 Yehoshua returned, and all Yisra'el with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
\p
\v 16 These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Maqedah.
\v 17 Yehoshua was told, saying, "The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Maqedah."
\v 18 Yehoshua said, "Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;
\v 19 but do not stay. Pursue your enemies, and them from the rear. Do not allow them to enter into their cities; for יהוה your Elohim has delivered them into your hand."
\v 20 It happened, when Yehoshua and the children of Yisra'el had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,
\v 21 that all the people returned to the camp to Yehoshua at Maqedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Yisra'el.
\p
\v 22 Then Yehoshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me."
\v 23 They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Yerushalyim, the king of Ḥevron, the king of Yarmuth, the king of Lakish, and the king of Eglon.
\v 24 It happened, when they brought those kings out to Yehoshua, that Yehoshua called for all the men of Yisra'el, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, "Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings." They came near, and put their feet on their necks.
\v 25 Yehoshua said to them, "Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for יהוה will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight."
\v 26 Afterward Yehoshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees until the evening.
\v 27 It happened at the time of the going down of the sun, that Yehoshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.
\p
\v 28 Yehoshua took Maqedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly destroyed them and all the beings who were in it. He left none remaining. He did to the king of Maqedah as he had done to the king of Yeriḥo.
\p
\v 29 Yehoshua passed from Maqedah, and all Yisra'el with him, to Livnah, and fought against Livnah.
\v 30 יהוה delivered it also, with its king, into the hand of Yisra'el. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the beings who were in it. He left none remaining in it. He did to its king as he had done to the king of Yeriḥo.
\p
\v 31 Yehoshua passed from Livnah, and all Yisra'el with him, to Lakish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.
\v 32 יהוה delivered Lakish into the hand of Yisra'el. He took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with all the beings who were in it, according to all that he had done to Livnah.
\p
\v 33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lakish; and Yehoshua struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
\p
\v 34 Yehoshua passed from Lakish, and all Yisra'el with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it fought against it.
\v 35 They took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed all the beings who were in it that day, according to all that he had done to Lakish.
\p
\v 36 Yehoshua went up from Eglon, and all Yisra'el with him, to Ḥevron; and they fought against it.
\v 37 They took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all the beings who were in it. He left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the beings who were in it.
\p
\v 38 Yehoshua returned, and all Yisra'el with him, to Devir, and fought against it.
\v 39 He took it, with its king and all its cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the beings who were in it. He left none remaining. As he had done to Ḥevron, so he did to Devir, and to its king; as he had done also to Livnah, and to its king.
\p
\v 40 So Yehoshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, commanded.
\v 41 Yehoshua struck them from Qadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Givon.
\v 42 Yehoshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, fought for Yisra'el.
\v 43 Yehoshua returned, and all Yisra'el with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 It happened, when Yavin king of Ḥatsor heard of it, that he sent to Yovav king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Akshaph,
\v 2 and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country, in the Aravah south of Kinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,
\v 3 to the Kena'anite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Ḥittite, and the Perizzite, and the Yevusite in the hill country, and the Ḥivite under Ḥermon in the land of Mitspah.
\v 4 They went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.
\v 5 All these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Yisra'el.
\p
\v 6 יהוה said to Yehoshua, "Do not be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver them up all slain before Yisra'el. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."
\v 7 So Yehoshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them.
\v 8 יהוה delivered them into the hand of Yisra'el, and they struck them, and chased them to great Tsidon, and to Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mitspeh eastward. They struck them until they left them none remaining.
\v 9 Yehoshua did to them as יהוה told him. He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
\p
\v 10 Yehoshua turned back at that time, and took Ḥatsor, and struck its king with the sword: for Ḥatsor used to be the head of all those kingdoms.
\v 11 They struck all the beings who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed. He burned Ḥatsor with fire.
\v 12 Yehoshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded.
\v 13 But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Yisra'el burned none of them, except Ḥatsor only. Yehoshua burned that.
\v 14 The children of Yisra'el took all the spoil of these cities, with the livestock, as spoils for themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They did not leave any who breathed.
\v 15 As יהוה commanded Mosheh His servant, so Mosheh commanded Yehoshua. Yehoshua did so. He left nothing undone of all that יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 16 So Yehoshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Aravah, the hill country of Yisra'el, and the lowland of the same;
\v 17 from Mount Ḥalaq, that goes up to Seir, even to Ba'al Gad in the valley of Levanon under Mount Ḥermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.
\v 18 Yehoshua made war a long time with all those kings.
\v 19 There was not a city that made peace with the children of Yisra'el, except the Ḥivites, the inhabitants of Givon. They took all in battle.
\v 20 For it was of יהוה to harden their hearts, to come against Yisra'el in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that He might destroy them, as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 21 Yehoshua came at that time, and cut off the Anaqim from the hill country, from Ḥevron, from Devir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Yehudah, and from all the hill country of Yisra'el: Yehoshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
\v 22 There were none of the Anaqim left in the land of the children of Yisra'el. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.
\v 23 So Yehoshua took the whole land, according to all that יהוה spoke to Mosheh; and Yehoshua gave it for an inheritance to Yisra'el according to their divisions by their tribes. The land had rest from war.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Yisra'el struck, and possessed their land beyond the Yarden toward the sunrise, from the wadi of Arnon to Mount Ḥermon, and all the Aravah eastward:
\v 2 Siḥon king of the Amorites, who lived in Ḥeshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and the middle of the wadi, and half Gilad, even to the wadi Yabboq, the border of the children of Ammon;
\v 3 and the Aravah to the sea of Kinneroth, eastward, and to the sea of the Aravah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth Yeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
\v 4 and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
\v 5 and ruled in Mount Ḥermon, and in Salekah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Ma'akathites, and half Gilad, the border of Siḥon king of Ḥeshbon.
\v 6 Mosheh the servant of יהוה and the children of Yisra'el struck them. Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave it for a possession to the Reuvenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Menasheh.
\p
\v 7 These are the kings of the land whom Yehoshua and the children of Yisra'el struck beyond the Yarden westward, from Ba'al Gad in the valley of Levanon even to Mount Ḥalaq, that goes up to Seir. Yehoshua gave it to the tribes of Yisra'el for a possession according to their divisions;
\v 8 in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Aravah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Ḥittite, the Amorite, and the Kena'anite, the Perizzite, the Ḥivite, and the Yevusite:
\v 9 the king of Yeriḥo, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Beth El, one;
\v 10 the king of Yerushalyim, one; the king of Ḥevron, one;
\v 11 the king of Yarmuth, one; the king of Lakish, one;
\v 12 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
\v 13 the king of Devir, one; the king of Geder, one;
\v 14 the king of Ḥormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
\v 15 the king of Livnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
\v 16 the king of Maqedah, one; the king of Beth-El, one;
\v 17 the king of Tappuaḥ, one; the king of Ḥepher, one;
\v 18 the king of Apheq, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
\v 19 the king of Madon, one; the king of Ḥatsor, one;
\v 20 the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Akshaph, one;
\v 21 the king of Ta'anakh, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
\v 22 the king of Qedesh, one; the king of Yoqneam in Karmel, one;
\v 23 the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goyim in Gilgal, one;
\v 24 the king of Tirtsah, one: all the kings thirty-one.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now Yehoshua was old and well advanced in days. יהוה said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.
\v 2 This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
\v 3 from the Shihor, which is before Mitsrayim, even to the border of Eqron northward, which is counted as Kena'anite; the five masters of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashqelonites, the Gittites, and the Eqronites; also the Avvim,
\v 4 on the south; all the land of the Kena'anites, and Mearah that belongs to the Tsidonians, to Apheq, to the border of the Amorites;
\v 5 and the land of the Gevalites, and all Levanon, toward the sunrise, from Ba'al Gad under Mount Ḥermon to the entrance of Ḥamath;
\v 6 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Levanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Tsidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Yisra'el: only allocate it to Yisra'el for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
\v 7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Menasheh."
\p
\v 8 With him the Reuvenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Mosheh gave them, beyond the Yarden eastward, even as Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave them:
\v 9 from Aroer, that is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the wadi, and all the plain of Medeva to Divon;
\v 10 and all the cities of Siḥon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Ḥeshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;
\v 11 and Gilad, and the border of the Geshurites and Ma'akathites, and all Mount Ḥermon, and all Bashan to Salekah;
\v 12 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Mosheh attacked these, and drove them out.
\v 13 Nevertheless the children of Yisra'el did not drive out the Geshurites, nor the Ma'akathites: but Geshur and Ma'akath dwell in the midst of Yisra'el to this day.
\v 14 Only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The offerings of יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, made by fire are his inheritance, as He spoke to him.
\p
\v 15 Mosheh gave to the tribe of the children of Reuven according to their families.
\v 16 Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the wadi, and all the plain by Medeva;
\v 17 Ḥeshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Divon, Bamoth Ba'al, Beth Ba'al Meon,
\v 18 Yahats, Qedemoth, Mepha'ath,
\v 19 Qiryathayim, Sivmah, Tsereth-Shaḥar in the mount of the valley,
\v 20 Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth Yeshimoth,
\v 21 all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Siḥon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Ḥeshbon, whom Mosheh struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, Reqem, Tsur, Ḥur, and Reva, the princes of Siḥon, who lived in the land.
\p
\v 22 The children of Yisra'el also killed Bil'am the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, among the rest of their slain.
\v 23 The border of the children of Reuven was the bank of the Yarden. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuven according to their families, the cities and its villages.
\p
\v 24 Mosheh gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad, according to their families.
\v 25 Their border was Yazer, and all the cities of Gilad, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;
\v 26 and from Ḥeshbon to Ramath Mitspeh, and Betonim; and from Maḥanaim to the border of Devir;
\v 27 and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Sukkoth, and Tsaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Siḥon king of Ḥeshbon, the Yarden's bank, to the uttermost part of the sea of Kinnereth beyond the Yarden eastward.
\v 28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages.
\p
\v 29 Mosheh gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Menasheh. It was for the half-tribe of the children of Menasheh according to their families.
\v 30 Their border was from Maḥanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Yair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities.
\v 31 Half Gilad, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Makir the son of Menasheh, even for the half of the children of Makir according to their families.
\p
\v 32 These are the inheritances which Mosheh distributed in the plains of Moav, beyond the Yarden at Yeriḥo, eastward.
\v 33 But to the tribe of Levi Mosheh gave no inheritance. יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, is their inheritance, as He spoke to them.

\v 1 These are the inheritances which the children of Yisra'el took in the land of Kena'an, which Elazar the priest, Yehoshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Yisra'el, distributed to them,
\v 2 by the lot of their inheritance, as יהוה commanded by Mosheh, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
\v 3 For Mosheh had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Yarden; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
\v 4 For the children of Yoseph were two tribes, Menasheh and Ephrayim: and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their livestock and for their property.
\v 5 The children of Yisra'el did as יהוה commanded Mosheh, and they divided the land.
\p
\v 6 Then the children of Yehudah drew near to Yehoshua in Gilgal. Kalev the son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know the thing that יהוה spoke to Mosheh the man of Elohim concerning me and concerning you in Qadesh Barnea.
\v 7 I was forty years old when Mosheh the servant of יהוה sent me from Qadesh Barnea to spy out the land. I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
\v 8 Nevertheless, my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed יהוה my Elohim.
\v 9 Mosheh swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land where you walked shall be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have wholly followed יהוה my Elohim.'
\v 10 Now, behold, יהוה has kept me alive, as He spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that יהוה spoke this word to Mosheh, while Yisra'el walked in the wilderness. Now, behold, I am eighty-five years old, today.
\v 11 As yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Mosheh sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, to go out and to come in.
\v 12 Now therefore give me this hill country, of which יהוה spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anaqim were there, and great and fortified cities. It may be that יהוה will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as יהוה spoke."
\p
\v 13 Yehoshua blessed him; and he gave Ḥevron to Kalev the son of Yephunneh for an inheritance.
\v 14 Therefore Ḥevron became the inheritance of Kalev the son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because he wholly followed יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Now the name of Ḥevron before was Qiryath Arba, after the greatest man among the Anaqim. The land had rest from war.
\p
\v 15 The lot for the tribe of the children of Yehudah according to their families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Tsin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
\v 2 Their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looks southward;
\v 3 and it went out southward of the ascent of Aqrabbim, and passed along to Tsin, and went up by the south of Qadesh Barnea, and passed along by Ḥetsron, went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka;
\v 4 and it passed along to Atsmon, went out at the wadi of Mitsrayim; and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your south border.
\v 5 The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Yarden. The border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Yarden.
\v 6 The border went up to Beth Ḥoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth Aravah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuven.
\v 7 The border went up to Devir from the wadi of Akor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river. The border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh, and ended at En Rogel.
\v 8 The border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the side of the Yevusite southward (the same is Yerushalyim); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the farthest part of the valley of Rephaim northward.
\v 9 The border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Ba'alah (the same is Qiryath Yearim);
\v 10 and the border turned about from Ba'alah westward to Mount Seir, and passed along to the side of Mount Yearim on the north (the same is Kesalon), and went down to Beth Shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;
\v 11 and the border went out to the side of Eqron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to Mount Ba'alah, and went out at Yavne'el; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
\v 12 The west border was to the shore of the great sea. This is the border of the children of Yehudah according to their families.
\p
\v 13 To Kalev the son of Yephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Yehudah, according to the command of יהוה to Yehoshua, even Qiryath Arba, named after the father of Anaq (the same is Ḥevron).
\v 14 Kalev drove out the three sons of Anaq: Sheshai, and Aḥiman, and Talmai, the children of Anaq.
\v 15 He went up against the inhabitants of Devir: now the name of Devir before was Qiryath Sepher.
\v 16 Kalev said, "He who strikes Qiryath Sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Aksah my daughter as wife."
\v 17 Othni'el the son of Qenaz, the brother of Kalev, took it: and he gave him Aksah his daughter as wife.
\v 18 It happened, when she came, that she had him ask her father for a field. She got off of her donkey, and Kalev said, "What do you want?"
\v 19 She said, "Give me a blessing. Because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water." He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
\p
\v 20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Yehudah according to their families.
\p
\v 21 The farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Yehudah toward the border of Edom in the South were Qavtse'el, Eder, Yagur,
\v 22 Qinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
\v 23 Qedesh, Ḥatsor, Yithnan,

\p
\v 61 In the wilderness, Beth Aravah, Middin, Secacah,
\v 62 Nivshan, the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities with their villages.
\p
\v 63 As for the Yevusites, the inhabitants of Yerushalyim, the children of Yehudah could not drive them out; but the Yevusites live with the children of Yehudah at Yerushalyim to this day.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 The lot came out for the children of Yoseph from the Yarden at Yeriḥo, at the waters of Yeriḥo on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Yeriḥo through the hill country to Beth-El.
\v 2 It went out from Beth-El to Luz, and passed along to the border of the Arkites to Ataroth;
\v 3 and it went down westward to the border of the Yaphletites, to the border of Beth Ḥoron the lower, even to Gezer; and ended at the sea.
\p
\v 4 The children of Yoseph, Menasheh and Ephrayim, took their inheritance.
\v 5 This was the border of the children of Ephrayim according to their families. The border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Ḥoron the upper.
\v 6 The border went out westward at Mikmethath on the north. The border turned about eastward to Ta'anath Shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Yanoah.
\v 7 It went down from Yanoah to Ataroth, to Na'arah, reached to Yeriḥo, and went out at the Yarden.
\v 8 From Tappuaḥ the border went along westward to the wadi of Qanah; and ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephrayim according to their families;
\v 9 together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephrayim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Menasheh, all the cities with their villages.
\v 10 They did not drive out the Kena'anites who lived in Gezer; but the Kena'anites dwell in the midst of Ephrayim to this day, and have become servants to do forced labor.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 This was the lot for the tribe of Menasheh, for he was the firstborn of Yoseph. As for Makir the firstborn of Menasheh, the father of Gilad, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilad and Bashan.
\v 2 So this was for the rest of the children of Menasheh according to their families: for the children of Aviezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asri'el, for the children of Shekhem, for the children of Ḥepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Menasheh the son of Yoseph according to their families.
\p
\v 3 But Tselophḥad, the son of Ḥepher, the son of Gilad, the son of Makir, the son of Menasheh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Maḥlah, Noah, Ḥoglah, Milkah, and Tirtsah.
\v 4 They came near before Elazar the priest, and before Yehoshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, "יהוה commanded Mosheh to give us an inheritance among our brothers." Therefore according to the command of יהוה he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
\v 5 Ten parts fell to Menasheh, besides the land of Gilad and Bashan, which is beyond the Yarden;
\v 6 because the daughters of Menasheh had an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilad belonged to the rest of the sons of Menasheh.
\p
\v 7 The border of Menasheh was from Asher to Mikmethath, which is before Shekhem. The border went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuaḥ.
\v 8 The land of Tappuaḥ belonged to Menasheh; but Tappuaḥ on the border of Menasheh belonged to the children of Ephrayim.
\v 9 The border went down to the wadi of Qanah, southward of the wadi. These cities belonged to Ephrayim among the cities of Menasheh. The border of Menasheh was on the north side of the wadi, and ended at the sea.
\v 10 Southward it was Ephrayim's, and northward it was Menasheh's, and the sea was his border. They reached to Asher on the north, and to Yissakhar on the east.
\v 11 Menasheh had three heights in Yissakhar, in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Ta'anakh and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns.
\v 12 Yet the children of Menasheh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Kena'anites would dwell in that land.
\v 13 It happened, when the children of Yisra'el had grown strong, that they put the Kena'anites to forced labor, and did not utterly drive them out.
\p
\v 14 The children of Yoseph spoke to Yehoshua, saying, "Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance, since I am a great people, because יהוה has blessed me so far?"
\v 15 Yehoshua said to them, "If you are a great people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephrayim is too narrow for you."
\v 16 The children of Yoseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us. All the Kena'anites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Yizre'el."
\v 17 Yehoshua spoke to the house of Yoseph, even to Ephrayim and to Menasheh, saying, "You are a great people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only;
\v 18 but the hill country shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and its farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Kena'anites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong."
\c 18
\p
\v 1 The whole congregation of the children of Yisra'el assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the Tent of Appointment there. The land was subdued before them.
\p
\v 2 Seven tribes remained among the children of Yisra'el, which had not yet divided their inheritance.
\v 3 Yehoshua said to the children of Yisra'el, "How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land, which יהוה, the Elohim of your fathers, has given you?
\v 4 Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe. I will send them, and they shall arise, walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come to me.
\v 5 They shall divide it into seven portions. Yehudah shall live in his borders on the south, and the house of Yoseph shall live in their borders on the north.
\v 6 You shall survey the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for you here before יהוה our Elohim.
\v 7 For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of יהוה is their inheritance. Gad, Reuven, and the half-tribe of Menasheh have received their inheritance beyond the Yarden eastward, which Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave them."
\p
\v 8 The men arose and went. Yehoshua commanded those who went to survey the land, saying, "Go walk through the land, survey it, and come again to me. I will cast lots for you here before יהוה in Shiloh."
\v 9 The men went and passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book. They came to Yehoshua to the camp at Shiloh.
\v 10 Yehoshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before יהוה. There Yehoshua divided the land to the children of Yisra'el according to their divisions.
\p
\v 11 The lot of the tribe of the children of Benyamin came up according to their families. The border of their lot went out between the children of Yehudah and the children of Yoseph.
\v 12 Their border on the north quarter was from the Yarden. The border went up to the side of Yeriḥo on the north, and went up through the hill country westward. It ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven.
\v 13 The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-El), southward. The border went down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Ḥoron the lower.
\v 14 The border extended, and turned around on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth Ḥoron southward; and ended at Qiryath Ba'al (the same is Qiryath Yearim), a city of the children of Yehudah. This was the west quarter.
\v 15 The south quarter was from the farthest part of Qiryath Yearim. The border went out westward, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
\v 16 The border went down to the farthest part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward. It went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Yevusite southward, and went down to En Rogel.
\v 17 It extended northward, went out at En Shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim. It went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuven.
\v 18 It passed along to the side over against the Aravah northward, and went down to the Aravah.
\v 19 The border passed along to the side of Beth Ḥoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Yarden. This was the south border.
\v 20 The Yarden was its border on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benyamin, by the borders around it, according to their families.
\p
\v 21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benyamin according to their families were Yeriḥo, Beth Ḥoglah, Emeq Qetsits,
\v 22 Beth Aravah, Tsemaraim, Beth-El,
\v 23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
\v 24 Ḥephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geva; twelve cities with their villages.
\v 25 Givon, Ramah, Beeroth,
\v 26 Mitspeh, Kephirah, Motsah,
\v 27 Reqem, Yirpe'el, Taralah,
\v 28 Tselah, Eleph, the Yevusite (the same is Yerushalyim), Givath, and Qiryath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benyamin according to their families.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 The second lot came out for Shimon, even for the tribe of the children of Shimon according to their families. Their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Yehudah.
\v 2 They had for their inheritance Beersheva (or Sheva), Moladah,
\v 3 Ḥatsar Shual, Balah, Etsem,
\v 4 Eltolad, Bethul, Ḥormah,
\v 5 Tsiqlag, Beth Marcaboth, Ḥatsar Susah,
\v 6 Beth-Levaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages;
\v 7 Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages;
\v 8 and all the villages that were around these cities to Ba'alath Beer, Ramah of the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Shimon according to their families.
\v 9 Out of the part of the children of Yehudah was the inheritance of the children of Shimon; for the portion of the children of Yehudah was too much for them. Therefore the children of Shimon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
\p
\v 10 The third lot came up for the children of Zevulun according to their families. The border of their inheritance was to Sarid.
\v 11 Their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth. It reached to the wadi that is before Yoqneam.
\v 12 It turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Kisloth Tavor. It went out to Daverath, and went up to Yafia.
\v 13 From there it passed along eastward to Gath Ḥepher, to Eth-Qatsin; and it went out at Rimmon which stretches to Neah.
\v 14 The border turned around it on the north to Ḥannathon; and it ended at the valley of Yiphtaḥ-El;
\v 15 Qattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Beth-leḥem: twelve cities with their villages.
\v 16 This is the inheritance of the children of Zevulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
\p
\v 17 The fourth lot came out for Yissakhar, even for the children of Yissakhar according to their families.
\v 18 Their border was to Yizre'el, Kesulloth, Shunem,
\v 19 Ḥapharaim, Shion, Anaḥarath,
\v 20 Rabbith, Qishion, Evets,
\v 21 Remeth, Engannim, En Haddah, and Beth-Patsets.
\v 22 The border reached to Tavor, Shaḥatsom, and Beth-Shemesh. Their border ended at the Yarden: sixteen cities with their villages.
\v 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Yissakhar according to their families, the cities with their villages.
\p
\v 24 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.
\v 25 Their border was Ḥelqath, Hali, Beten, Akshaph,
\v 26 Allammelekh, Amad, Mishal. It reached to Karmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath.
\v 27 It turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon, and reached to Zevulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emeq and Nei'el. It went out to Kavul on the left hand,
\v 28 and Ebron, Reḥov, Ḥammon, and Qanah, even to great Tsidon.
\v 29 The border turned to Ramah, to the fortified city of Tsor; and the border turned to Ḥosah. It ended at the sea by the region of Akziv;
\v 30 Ummah also, and Apheq, and Reḥov: twenty-two cities with their villages.
\v 31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
\p
\v 32 The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
\v 33 Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Tsa'anannim, Adaminekeb, and Yavne'el, to Laqqum. It ended at the Yarden.
\v 34 The border turned westward to Aznoth Tavor, and went out from there to Ḥuqoq. It reached to Zevulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Yehudah at the Yarden toward the sunrise.
\v 35 The fortified cities were Tsiddim, Tser, Ḥammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth,
\v 36 Adamah, Ramah, Ḥatsor,
\v 37 Qedesh, Edrei, En Ḥatsor,
\v 38 Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
\v 39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages.
\p
\v 40 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.
\v 41 The border of their inheritance was Tsorah, Eshtaol, Yirshemesh,

\v 44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Ba'alath,
\v 45 Yehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,
\v 46 Me Yarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Yapho.
\v 47 The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
\v 48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
\p
\v 49 So they finished distributing the land for inheritance by its borders. The children of Yisra'el gave an inheritance to Yehoshua the son of Nun in the midst of them.
\v 50 According to the command of יהוה, they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath Seraḥ in the hill country of Ephrayim; and he built the city, and lived there.
\v 51 These are the inheritances, which Elazar the priest, Yehoshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Yisra'el, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before יהוה, at the door of the Tent of Appointment. And they finished dividing the land.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 יהוה spoke to Yehoshua, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, saying, 'Assign the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Mosheh,
\v 3 that the manslayer who kills any person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there. They shall be to you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.
\v 4 He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city. They shall take him into the city with them, and give him a place, that he may live among them.
\v 5 If the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, and did not hate him before.
\v 6 He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days. Then the manslayer shall return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city he fled from.'"
\p
\v 7 They set apart Qedesh in the Galil in the hill country of Naphtali, Shekhem in the hill country of Ephrayim, and Qiryath Arba (the same is Ḥevron) in the hill country of Yehudah.
\v 8 Beyond the Yarden at Yeriḥo eastward, they assigned Betser in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuven, Ramoth in Gilad out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Menasheh.
\v 9 These were the appointed cities for all the children of Yisra'el, and for the sojourner who lives among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stands before the congregation.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Then the heads of fathers' houses of the Levites came near to Elazar the priest, and to Yehoshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Yisra'el.
\v 2 They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Kena'an, saying, "יהוה commanded Mosheh to give us cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for our livestock."
\v 3 The children of Yisra'el gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the command of יהוה, these cities with their suburbs.
\v 4 The lot came out for the families of the Qohathites. The children of Aharon the priest, who were of the Levites, had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of Yehudah, out of the tribe of the Shimonites, and out of the tribe of Benyamin.
\p
\v 5 The rest of the children of Qohath had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephrayim, out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Menasheh.
\p
\v 6 The children of Gershon had thirteen cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Yissakhar, out of the tribe of Asher, out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Menasheh in Bashan.
\p
\v 7 The children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuven, out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zevulun.
\p
\v 8 The children of Yisra'el gave these cities with their suburbs by lot to the Levites, as יהוה commanded by Mosheh.
\p
\v 9 They gave out of the tribe of the children of Yehudah, and out of the tribe of the children of Shimon, these cities which are mentioned by name:
\v 10 and they were for the children of Aharon, of the families of the Qohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot.
\v 11 They gave them Qiryath Arba, named after the father of Anaq (the same is Ḥevron), in the hill country of Yehudah, with its suburbs around it.
\v 12 But they gave the fields of the city and its villages to Kalev the son of Yephunneh for his possession.
\p
\v 13 To the children of Aharon the priest they gave Ḥevron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, Livnah with its suburbs,
\v 14 Yattir with its suburbs, Eshtemoa with its suburbs,
\v 15 Ḥolon with its suburbs, Devir with its suburbs,
\v 16 Ain with its suburbs, Yuttah with its suburbs, and Beth Shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
\v 17 Out of the tribe of Benyamin, Givon with its suburbs, Geva with its suburbs,
\v 18 Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
\v 19 All the cities of the children of Aharon, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
\p
\v 20 The families of the children of Qohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Qohath, had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephrayim.
\v 21 They gave them Shekhem with its suburbs in the hill country of Ephrayim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with its suburbs,
\v 22 Qivtsayim with its suburbs, and Beth Ḥoron with its suburbs; four cities.
\v 23 Out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,
\v 24 Aiyalon with its suburbs, Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.
\v 25 Out of the half-tribe of Menasheh, Ta'anakh with its suburbs, and Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
\v 26 All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Qohath were ten with their suburbs.
\p
\v 27 They gave to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Menasheh Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be Eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.
\v 28 Out of the tribe of Yissakhar, Qishion with its suburbs, Daverath with its suburbs,
\v 29 Yarmuth with its suburbs, En Gannim with its suburbs; four cities.
\v 30 Out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,
\v 31 Ḥelqath with its suburbs, and Reḥov with its suburbs; four cities.
\v 32 Out of the tribe of Naphtali, Qedesh in the Galil with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, Hammothdor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
\v 33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
\p
\v 34 To the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zevulun, Yoqneam with its suburbs, Kartah with its suburbs,
\v 35 Dimnah with its suburbs, and Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
\v 36 Out of the tribe of Reuven, Betser with its suburbs, Yahats with its suburbs,
\v 37 Qedemoth with its suburbs, and Mepha'ath with its suburbs; four cities.
\v 38 Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilad with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Maḥanaim with its suburbs,
\v 39 Ḥeshbon with its suburbs, Yazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.
\v 40 All these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites. Their lot was twelve cities.
\p
\v 41 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Yisra'el were forty-eight cities with their suburbs.
\v 42 Each of these cities included their suburbs around them. It was this way with all these cities.
\p
\v 43 So יהוה gave to Yisra'el all the land which He swore to give to their fathers. They possessed it, and lived in it.
\v 44 יהוה gave them rest all around, according to all that He swore to their fathers. Not a man of all their enemies stood before them. יהוה delivered all their enemies into their hand.
\v 45 Nothing failed of any good thing which יהוה had spoken to the house of Yisra'el: it all came about.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then Yehoshua called the Reuvenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Menasheh,
\v 2 and said to them, "You have kept all that Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you.
\v 3 You have not left your brothers these many days to this day, but have performed the duty of the command of יהוה your Elohim.
\v 4 Now יהוה your Elohim has given rest to your brothers, as He spoke to them. Therefore now return and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave you beyond the Yarden.
\v 5 Only guard to do the command and the Torah which Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded you, to love יהוה your Elohim, to walk in all His ways, to guard His commands, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your being."
\v 6 So Yehoshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents.
\p
\v 7 Now to the one half-tribe of Menasheh Mosheh had given inheritance in Bashan; but to the other half gave Yehoshua among their brothers beyond the Yarden westward. Moreover when Yehoshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,
\v 8 and spoke to them, saying, "Return with much wealth to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with copper, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers."
\v 9 The children of Reuven and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh returned, and departed from the children of Yisra'el out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Kena'an, to go to the land of Gilad, to the land of their possession, which they owned, according to the command of יהוה by Mosheh.
\v 10 When they came to the region about the Yarden, that is in the land of Kena'an, the children of Reuven and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh built there an altar by the Yarden, a great altar to look at.
\v 11 The children of Yisra'el heard this, "Behold, the children of Reuven and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Kena'an, in the region about the Yarden, on the side that pertains to the children of Yisra'el."
\v 12 When the children of Yisra'el heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Yisra'el gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
\p
\v 13 The children of Yisra'el sent to the children of Reuven, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Menasheh, into the land of Gilad, Pineḥas the son of Elazar the priest,
\v 14 and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Yisra'el; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Yisra'el.
\v 15 They came to the children of Reuven, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Menasheh, to the land of Gilad, and they spoke with them, saying,
\v 16 "Thus says the whole congregation of יהוה, 'What trespass is this that you have committed against the Elohim of Yisra'el, to turn away today from following יהוה, in that you have built you an altar, to rebel today against יהוה?
\v 17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to today, although there came a plague on the congregation of יהוה,
\v 18 that you must turn away today from following יהוה? It will be, since you rebel today against יהוה, that tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Yisra'el.
\v 19 However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of יהוה, in which the Tabernacle of יהוה dwells, and take possession among us; but do not rebel against יהוה, nor rebel against us, in building an altar other than the altar of יהוה our Elohim.
\v 20 Did not Akan the son of Zeraḥ commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Yisra'el? That man did not perish alone in his iniquity.'"
\p
\v 21 Then the children of Reuven and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Yisra'el,
\v 22 "El Elohim, יהוה, El Elohim, יהוה, He knows; and Yisra'el shall know: if it was in rebellion, or if in trespass against יהוה (do not save us today),
\v 23 that we have built us an altar to turn away from following יהוה; or if to offer ascension offering or meal offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings, let יהוה Himself require it.
\v 24 If we have not out of concern done this, and for a reason, saying, 'In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, "What have you to do with יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el?
\v 25 For יהוה has made the Yarden a border between us and you, you children of Reuven and children of Gad. You have no portion in יהוה."' So your children might make our children cease from fearing יהוה.
\p
\v 26 "Therefore we said, 'Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for ascension offering, nor for sacrifice;
\v 27 but it will be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may perform the service of יהוה before Him with our ascension offerings, with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings;' that your children may not tell our children in time to come, 'You have no portion in יהוה.'
\v 28 Therefore we said, 'It shall be, when they tell us or our generations this in time to come, that we shall say, "Behold the pattern of the altar of יהוה, which our fathers made, not for ascension offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you."'
\v 29 Far be it from us that we should rebel against יהוה, and turn away today from following יהוה, to build an altar for ascension offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of יהוה our Elohim that is before His Tabernacle!"
\p
\v 30 When Pineḥas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Yisra'el that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuven and the children of Gad and the children of Menasheh spoke, it pleased them well.
\v 31 Pineḥas the son of Elazar the priest said to the children of Reuven, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Menasheh, "Today we know that יהוה is in the midst of us, because you have not committed this trespass against יהוה. Now you have delivered the children of Yisra'el out of the hand of יהוה."
\p
\v 32 Pineḥas the son of Elazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuven, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilad, to the land of Kena'an, to the children of Yisra'el, and brought them word again.
\v 33 The thing pleased the children of Yisra'el; and the children of Yisra'el blessed Elohim, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuven and the children of Gad lived.
\v 34 The children of Reuven and the children of Gad named the altar "A Witness Between Us that יהוה is Elohim."
\c 23
\p
\v 1 It happened after many days, when יהוה had given rest to Yisra'el from their enemies all around, and Yehoshua was old and well advanced in years,
\v 2 that Yehoshua called for all Yisra'el, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said to them, "I am old and well advanced in years.
\v 3 You have seen all that יהוה your Elohim has done to all these nations because of you; for it is יהוה your Elohim who has fought for you.
\v 4 Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Yarden, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea toward the going down of the sun.
\v 5 יהוה your Elohim will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight. You shall possess their land, as יהוה your Elohim spoke to you.
\v 6 Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the Torah of Mosheh, that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
\v 7 that you not come among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their elohim, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves to them;
\v 8 but hold fast to יהוה your Elohim, as you have done to this day.
\v 9 "For יהוה has driven great and strong nations out from before you. But as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.
\v 10 One man of you shall chase a thousand; for it is יהוה your Elohim who fights for you, as He spoke to you.
\v 11 Guard yourselves therefore, that you love יהוה your Elohim.
\v 12 But if you do at all go back, and hold fast to the remnant of these nations, even these who remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;
\v 13 know for a certainty that יהוה your Elohim will no longer drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap to you, a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which יהוה your Elohim has given you.
\p
\v 14 "Behold, today I am going the way of all the earth. You know in all your hearts and in all your beings that not one thing has failed of all the good things which יהוה your Elohim spoke concerning you. All have happened to you. Not one thing has failed of it.
\v 15 It shall happen that as all the good things have come on you of which יהוה your Elohim spoke to you, so יהוה will bring on you all the evil things, until He has destroyed you from off this good land which יהוה your Elohim has given you,
\v 16 when you disobey the covenant of יהוה your Elohim, which He commanded you, and go and serve other elohim, and bow down yourselves to them. Then the anger of יהוה will be kindled against you, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which He has given to you."
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Yehoshua gathered all the tribes of Yisra'el to Shekhem, and called for the elders of Yisra'el, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before Elohim.
\v 2 Yehoshua said to all the people, "Thus says יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el, 'Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River, even Teraḥ, the father of Avraham, and the father of Naḥor: and they served other elohim.
\v 3 I took your father Avraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Kena'an, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Yitsḥaq.
\v 4 I gave to Yitsḥaq Ya'aqov and Esaw: and I gave to Esaw Mount Seir, to possess it. Ya'aqov and his children went down into Mitsrayim.
\v 5 I sent Mosheh and Aharon, and I plagued Mitsrayim, according to that which I did in its midst: and afterward I brought you out.
\v 6 I brought your fathers out of Mitsrayim: and you came to the sea. The Mitsrites pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Sea of Reeds.
\v 7 When they cried out to יהוה, He put darkness between you and the Mitsrites, and brought the sea on them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Mitsrayim: and you lived in the wilderness many days.
\v 8 I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond the Yarden: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand. You possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
\v 9 Then Balaq the son of Tsippor, king of Moav, arose and fought against Yisra'el. He sent and called Bil'am the son of Beor to curse you;
\v 10 but I would not listen to Bil'am; therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered you out of his hand.
\v 11 You went over the Yarden, and came to Yeriḥo. The men of Yeriḥo fought against you, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Kena'anite, the Ḥittite, the Girgashite, the Ḥivite, and the Yevusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
\v 12 I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow.
\v 13 I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities which you did not build, and you live in them. You eat of vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.'
\p
\v 14 "Now therefore fear יהוה, and serve Him in sincerity and in truth. Put away the elohim which your fathers served beyond the River, in Mitsrayim; and serve יהוה.
\v 15 If it seems evil to you to serve יהוה, choose today whom you will serve; whether the elohim which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the elohim of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve יהוה."
\p
\v 16 The people answered, "Far be it from us that we should forsake יהוה, to serve other elohim;
\v 17 for it is יהוה our Elohim who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Mitsrayim, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and guarded us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed.
\v 18 יהוה drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve יהוה; for He is our Elohim."
\p
\v 19 Yehoshua said to the people, "You cannot serve יהוה; for He is a set-apart Elohim. He is a jealous El. He will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins.
\v 20 If you forsake יהוה, and serve foreign elohim, then He will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after He has done you good."
\v 21 The people said to Yehoshua, "No; but we will serve יהוה."
\v 22 Yehoshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen יהוה yourselves, to serve Him." They said, "We are witnesses."
\v 23 "Now therefore put away the foreign elohim which are among you, and incline your heart to יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra'el."
\v 24 The people said to Yehoshua, "We will serve יהוה our Elohim, and we will listen to His voice."
\v 25 So Yehoshua cut a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and a judgment in Shekhem.
\v 26 Yehoshua wrote these words in the book of the Torah of Elohim; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the set-apart place of יהוה.
\v 27 Yehoshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the speeches of יהוה which He spoke to us. It shall be therefore a witness against you, lest you deny your Elohim."
\v 28 So Yehoshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
\p
\v 29 It happened after these things, that Yehoshua the son of Nun, the servant of יהוה, died, being one hundred and ten years old.
\v 30 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Seraḥ, which is in the hill country of Ephrayim, on the north of the mountain of Ga'ash.
\v 31 Yisra'el served יהוה all the days of Yehoshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Yehoshua, and had known all the work of יהוה, that He had worked for Yisra'el.
\v 32 They buried the bones of Yoseph, which the children of Yisra'el brought up out of Mitsrayim, in Shekhem, in the parcel of ground which Ya'aqov bought of the sons of Ḥamor the father of Shekhem for a hundred pieces of money. They became the inheritance of the children of Yoseph.
\v 33 Elazar the son of Aharon died. They buried him in the hill of Pineḥas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephrayim.שֹׁפְטִים
